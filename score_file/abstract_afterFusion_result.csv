Neuroimmune Crosstalk through Extracellular Vesicles in Health and Disease,"The dynamics of CNS function rely upon omnidirectional communication among CNS cell types. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) have emerged as key mediators of this communication and are actively involved in response to CNS injury, mediating inflammatory response and inflammation-related neuroprotection as they display dual beneficial and detrimental roles. Neuroimmune interactions include communication between neurons and microglia, the resident macrophages within the CNS, and these interactions are a critical mediator of healthy brain functions, mounting an inflammatory response, and disease pathogenesis. This review aims to organize recent research highlighting the role of EVs in health and neurodegenerative disorders, with a specific focus on neuroimmune interactions between neurons and glia in Alzheimer's disease.",30926143,PMC6486849,10.1016/j.tins.2019.02.007,89
"Alzheimer's Disease: A Journey from Amyloid Peptides and Oxidative Stress, to Biomarker Technologies and Disease Prevention Strategies-Gains from AIBL and DIAN Cohort Studies","Worldwide there are over 46 million people living with dementia, and this number is expected to double every 20 years reaching about 131 million by 2050. The cost to the community and government health systems, as well as the stress on families and carers is incalculable. Over three decades of research into this disease have been undertaken by several research groups in Australia, including work by our original research group in Western Australia which was involved in the discovery and sequencing of the amyloid-β peptide (also known as Aβ or A4 peptide) extracted from cerebral amyloid plaques. This review discusses the journey from the discovery of the Aβ peptide in Alzheimer's disease (AD) brain to the establishment of pre-clinical AD using PET amyloid tracers, a method now serving as the gold standard for developing peripheral diagnostic approaches in the blood and the eye. The latter developments for early diagnosis have been largely achieved through the establishment of the Australian Imaging Biomarker and Lifestyle research group that has followed 1,100 Australians for 11 years. AIBL has also been instrumental in providing insight into the role of the major genetic risk factor apolipoprotein E ɛ4, as well as better understanding the role of lifestyle factors particularly diet, physical activity and sleep to cognitive decline and the accumulation of cerebral Aβ.",29562546,PMC5870031,10.3233/JAD-171145,43
Translating endoplasmic reticulum biology into the clinic: a role for ER-targeted natural products?,"ER stress has been identified as a hallmark, and sometimes trigger, of several pathologies, notably cancer, inflammation and neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's and Parkinson's. Among the molecules described in literature known to affect ER function, the majority are natural products, suggesting that natural molecules may constitute a significant arsenal of chemical entities for modulating this cellular target. In this review, we will start by presenting the current knowledge of ER biology and the hallmarks of ER stress, thus paving the way for presenting the natural products that have been described as being ER modulators, either stress inducers or ER protectors. The chemistry, distribution and mechanism of action of these compounds will be presented and discussed.",25703279,,10.1039/c4np00102h,17
Structure of amyloid oligomers and their mechanisms of toxicities: Targeting amyloid oligomers using novel therapeutic approaches,"Protein misfolding is one of the leading causes of amyloidoses. Protein misfolding occurs from changes in environmental conditions and host of other factors, including errors in post-translational modifications, increase in the rate of degradation, error in trafficking, loss of binding partners and oxidative damage. Misfolding gives rise to the formation of partially unfolded or misfolded intermediates, which have exposed hydrophobic residues and interact with complementary intermediates to form oligomers and consequently protofibrils and fibrils. The amyloid fibrils accumulate as amyloid deposits in the brain and central nervous system in Alzheimer's disease (AD), Prion disease and Parkinson's disease (PD). Initial studies have shown that amyloid fibrils were the main culprit behind toxicity that cause neurodegenerative diseases. However, attention shifted to the cytotoxicity of amyloid fibril precursors, notably amyloid oligomers, which are the major cause of toxicity. The mechanism of toxicity triggered by amyloid oligomers remains elusive. In this review, we have focused on the current knowledge of the structures of different aggregated states, including amyloid fibril, protofibrils, annular aggregates and oligomers. Based on the studies on the mechanism of toxicities, we hypothesize two major possible mechanisms of toxicities instigated by oligomers of Aβ (amyloid beta), PrP (prion protein) (106-126), and α-Syn (alpha-synuclein) including direct formation of ion channels and neuron membrane disruption by the increase in membrane conductance or leakage in the presence of small globulomers to large prefibrillar assemblies. Finally, we have discussed various novel innovative approaches that target amyloid oligomers in Alzheimer's diseases, Prion disease and Parkinson's disease.",26974374,,10.1016/j.ejmech.2016.02.065,23
Associations Between Plasma Orexin-A Level and Constipation in Cognitive Impairment,"Background:Constipation is a common symptom in dementia, and the cause is controversial. Rare clinical studies focused on plasma orexin-A levels and constipation in dementia.Objective:To evaluate the associations between orexin-A and constipation in patients with cognitive impairment.Methods:A total of 21 patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), 142 with Alzheimer's disease (AD), and 57 with Lewy body dementia (LBD) were conducted. Besides informant-based history, neurological examinations or neuropsychological assessments, plasma levels of orexin-A, and constipation were assessed. The associations between orexin-A and constipation were evaluated by logistic regression models.Results:There were 47/220 (21.36%) cognitive impairment patients having constipation, and the proportion of constipation in LBD (61.40%) was significantly higher than AD (5.63%) and MCI (19.05%). No significant age or sex differences in the prevalence of constipation were found in the MCI, AD, and LBD groups. We found the cognitive impairment patients with constipation had lower levels of plasma orexin-A [1.00 (0.86, 1.28) versus 1.29 (1.01, 1.50) ng/ml, p < 0.001] than those without. And the plasma levels of orexin-A were significantly associated with the occurrence of constipation after adjusting for all variables in all patients with cognitive impairment (OR = 0.151, 95% CI: 0.042-0.537, p = 0.003). And the same finding was more prominent in the LBD group (p = 0.048).Conclusions:The decrease of plasma level of orexin-A is closely associated with the occurrence of constipation. Orexin-A has an intestinal protective effect and is involved in the gastrointestinal symptoms of patients with cognitive impairment.",38143347,,10.3233/JAD-230625,0
Extracellular vesicles - propagators of neuropathology and sources of potential biomarkers and therapeutics for neurodegenerative diseases,"Neurodegenerative diseases are characterised by the irreversible degeneration of neurons in the central or peripheral nervous systems. These include amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD) and prion diseases. Small extracellular vesicles (sEVs), a type of EV involved in cellular communication, have been well documented as propagating neurodegenerative diseases. These sEVs carry cargo, such as proteins and RNA, to recipient cells but are also capable of promoting protein misfolding, thus actively contributing to the progression of these diseases. sEV secretion is also a compensatory process for lysosomal dysfunction in the affected cells, despite inadvertently propagating disease to recipient cells. Despite this, sEV miRNAs have biomarker potential for the early diagnosis of these diseases, while stem cell-derived sEVs and those generated through exogenous assistance demonstrate the greatest therapeutic potential. This Review will highlight novel advancements in the involvement of sEVs as propagators of neuropathology, biomarkers and potential therapeutics in neurodegenerative diseases.",33310868,,10.1242/jcs.243139,26
Towards Defining the Neuroanatomical Basis of Late-Onset Psychiatric Symptoms,"Psychiatric symptoms, including changes in emotional processing, are a common feature of many neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease, dementia with Lewy Bodies, frontotemporal dementia, and Huntington's disease. However, the neuroanatomical basis of emotional symptoms is not well defined; this stands in contrast to the relatively well-understood neuroanatomical correlates of cognitive and motor symptoms in neurodegenerative disorders. Furthermore, psychiatric diagnostic categories, as defined by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) and International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD), may have limited applicability in patients with late-onset psychiatric symptoms in the context of neurodegenerative disorders. In this clinical review, we suggest that early-onset and late-onset psychiatric symptoms have distinct etiologies, and that late-onset changes in emotional processing are likely underpinned by neurodegenerative disease. Furthermore, we suggest that an improved understanding of the neuroanatomical correlates of emotional changes in neurodegenerative disease may facilitate diagnosis and future treatment development. Finally, we propose a novel clinical approach, in a preliminary attempt to incorporate late-onset emotional symptoms alongside cognitive and motor symptoms into a clinical ""algorithm,"" with a focus on the neuroanatomy implicated when particular combinations of emotional, cognitive, and motor features are present. We anticipate that this clinical approach will assist with the diagnosis of neurodegenerative disorders, and our proposed schema represents a move towards integrating neurologic and psychiatric classification systems.",35380884,,10.1177/08919887221090213,2
Charting the Next Road Map for CSF Biomarkers in Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias,"Clinical prediction of underlying pathologic substrates in people with Alzheimer's disease (AD) dementia or related dementia syndromes (ADRD) has limited accuracy. Etiologic biomarkers - including cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of AD proteins and cerebral amyloid PET imaging - have greatly modernized disease-modifying clinical trials in AD, but their integration into medical practice has been slow. Beyond core CSF AD biomarkers (including beta-amyloid 1-42, total tau, and tau phosphorylated at threonine 181), novel biomarkers have been interrogated in single- and multi-centered studies with uneven rigor. Here, we review early expectations for ideal AD/ADRD biomarkers, assess these goals' future applicability, and propose study designs and performance thresholds for meeting these ideals with a focus on CSF biomarkers. We further propose three new characteristics: equity (oversampling of diverse populations in the design and testing of biomarkers), access (reasonable availability to 80% of people at risk for disease, along with pre- and post-biomarker processes), and reliability (thorough evaluation of pre-analytical and analytical factors influencing measurements and performance). Finally, we urge biomarker scientists to balance the desire and evidence for a biomarker to reflect its namesake function, indulge data- as well as theory-driven associations, re-visit the subset of rigorously measured CSF biomarkers in large datasets (such as Alzheimer's disease neuroimaging initiative), and resist the temptation to favor ease over fail-safe in the development phase. This shift from discovery to application, and from suspended disbelief to cogent ingenuity, should allow the AD/ADRD biomarker field to live up to its billing during the next phase of neurodegenerative disease research.",37378862,,10.1007/s13311-023-01370-8,3
Chronic Sleep Disturbances Alters Sleep Structure and Tau Phosphorylation in AβPP/PS1 AD Mice and Their Wild-Type Littermates,"Background:Emerging evidence indicates that sleep disorders are the common non-cognitive symptoms of Alzheimer's disease (AD), and they may contribute to the pathogenesis of this disease.Objective:In this study, we aim to investigate the effect of chronic sleep deprivation (CSD) on AD-related pathologies with a focus on tau phosphorylation and the underlying DNA methylation regulation.Methods:AβPPswe/PS1ΔE9 AD mice and their wild-type (WT) littermates were subjected to a two-month CSD followed by electroencephalography and electromyography recording. The mice were examined for learning and memory evaluation, then pathological, biochemical, and epigenetic assessments including western blotting, immunofluorescence, dot blotting, and bisulfite sequencing.Results:The results show that CSD caused sleep disturbances shown as sleep pattern change, poor sleep maintenance, and increased sleep fragmentation. CSD increased tau phosphorylation at different sites and increased the level of tau kinases in AD and WT mice. The increased expression of cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (CDK5) may result from decreased DNA methylation of CpG sites in the promoter region of CDK5 gene, which might be associated with the downregulation of DNA methyltransferase 3A and 3B.Conclusion:CSD altered AD-related tau phosphorylation through epigenetic modification of tau kinase gene. The findings in this study may give insights into the mechanisms underlying the effects of sleep disturbances on AD pathology and provide new therapeutic targets for the treatment of this disease.",37038814,,10.3233/JAD-221048,2
Bezafibrate confers neuroprotection in the 5xFAD mouse model of Alzheimer's disease,"Mitochondrial dysfunction plays an important role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common neurodegenerative disease. Prior studies suggested impaired mitochondrial biogenesis likely contributes to mitochondrial dysfunction in AD. Bezafibrate, a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) pan-agonist, has been shown to enhance mitochondrial biogenesis and increase oxidative phosphorylation capacity. In the present study, we investigated whether bezafibrate could rescue mitochondrial dysfunction and other AD-related deficits in 5xFAD mice. Bezafibrate was well tolerated by 5xFAD mice. Indeed, it rescued the expression of key mitochondrial proteins as well as mitochondrial dynamics and function in the brain of 5xFAD mice. Importantly, bezafibrate treatment led to significant improvement of cognitive/memory function in 5xFAD mice accompanied by alleviation of amyloid pathology and neuronal loss as well as reduced oxidative stress and neuroinflammation. Overall, this study suggests that bezafibrate improves mitochondrial function, mitigates neuroinflammation and improves cognitive functions in 5xFAD mice, thus supporting the notion that enhancing mitochondrial biogenesis/function is a promising therapeutic strategy for AD.",37558011,,10.1016/j.bbadis.2023.166841,0
The PERK-Dependent Molecular Mechanisms as a Novel Therapeutic Target for Neurodegenerative Diseases,"Higher prevalence of neurodegenerative diseases is strictly connected with progressive aging of the world population. Interestingly, a broad range of age-related, neurodegenerative diseases is characterized by a common pathological mechanism-accumulation of misfolded and unfolded proteins within the cells. Under certain circumstances, such protein aggregates may evoke endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress conditions and subsequent activation of the unfolded protein response (UPR) signaling pathways via the protein kinase RNA-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK)-dependent manner. Under mild to moderate ER stress, UPR has a pro-adaptive role. However, severe or long-termed ER stress conditions directly evoke shift of the UPR toward its pro-apoptotic branch, which is considered to be a possible cause of neurodegeneration. To this day, there is no effective cure for Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), Huntington's disease (HD), or prion disease. Currently available treatment approaches for these diseases are only symptomatic and cannot affect the disease progression. Treatment strategies, currently under detailed research, include inhibition of the PERK-dependent UPR signaling branches. The newest data have reported that the use of small-molecule inhibitors of the PERK-mediated signaling branches may contribute to the development of a novel, ground-breaking therapeutic approach for neurodegeneration. In this review, we critically describe all the aspects associated with such targeted therapy against neurodegenerative proteopathies.",32204380,PMC7139310,10.3390/ijms21062108,31
Inverse Relationship Between Alzheimer's Disease and Cancer: How Immune Checkpoints Might Explain the Mechanisms Underlying Age-Related Diseases,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prevalent neurodegenerative disease in the adult population. There is evidence of an inverse epidemiological relationship between AD and cancer, another prevalent age-related disease. This has led to hypothesize that there could be a common biological mechanism, deregulated in opposite directions that might explain the phenomenon of mutual protection. The immunological system and its regulatory checkpoints are good candidates to explain why having survived a cancer could protect from developing AD. During cancerous growth, the neoplastic cells induce immune tolerance to block the host's immunity system that would prevent tumor growth. This has led to the development of drugs that block distinct immune checkpoints, such as Programmed Death 1 (PD-1) and its major ligand PD-L1, that have shown great promise in treating diverse types of cancer. We propose that in those individuals who survived a cancer, the immune system is left in a state of diminished tolerance or proinflammatory systemic milieu, after its successful attempt to fight the cancer, that protects them from developing AD.",31839609,,10.3233/JAD-190839,11
Neuropeptides: Roles and Activities as Metal Chelators in Neurodegenerative Diseases,"Neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD), are characterized by deposits of amyloid proteins. The homeostasis of metal ions is crucial for the normal biological functions in the brain. However, in AD and PD, the imbalance of metal ions leads to formation of amyloid deposits. In the past four decades, there has been extensive effort to design compound agents than can chelate metal ions with the aim of preventing the formation of the amyloid deposits. Unfortunately, the compounds to date that were designed were not successful candidates to be used in clinical trials. Neuropeptides are small molecules that are produced and released by neurons. It has been shown that neuropeptides have neuroprotective effects in the brain and reduce the formation of amyloid deposits. This Review Article is focused on the function of neuropeptides as metal chelators. Experimental and computational studies demonstrated that neuropeptides could bind metal ions, such as Cu2+and Zn2+. This Review Article provides perspectives and initiates future studies to investigate the role of neuropeptides as metal chelators in neurodegenerative diseases.",33570949,PMC8389909,10.1021/acs.jpcb.0c11151,13
Therapeutic Potential of Human Stem Cell Implantation in Alzheimer's Disease,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive debilitating neurodegenerative disease and the most common form of dementia in the older population. At present, there is no definitive effective treatment for AD. Therefore, researchers are now looking at stem cell therapy as a possible treatment for AD, but whether stem cells are safe and effective in humans is still not clear. In this narrative review, we discuss both preclinical studies and clinical trials on the therapeutic potential of human stem cells in AD. Preclinical studies have successfully differentiated stem cells into neurons in vitro, indicating the potential viability of stem cell therapy in neurodegenerative diseases. Preclinical studies have also shown that stem cell therapy is safe and effective in improving cognitive performance in animal models, as demonstrated in the Morris water maze test and novel object recognition test. Although few clinical trials have been completed and many trials are still in phase I and II, the initial results confirm the outcomes of the preclinical studies. However, limitations like rejection, tumorigenicity, and ethical issues are still barriers to the advancement of stem cell therapy. In conclusion, the use of stem cells in the treatment of AD shows promise in terms of effectiveness and safety.",34576314,PMC8471075,10.3390/ijms221810151,12
Potential Clinical Role of Prokineticin 2 (PK2) in Neurodegenerative Diseases,"The role of the immune system in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD) has become clear in recent decades, as evidenced by the presence of activated microglia and astrocytes and numerous soluble mediators in the brain and peripheral tissues of affected patients. Among inflammatory mediators, chemokines play a central role in neuroinflammation due to their dual function as chemoattractants for immune cells and molecular messengers in crosstalk among CNS-resident cells. The chemokine Bv8/Prokineticin 2 (PK2) has recently emerged as an important player in many age-related and chronic diseases that are either neurodegenerative or systemic. In this perspective paper, we briefly discuss the role that PK2 and its cognate receptors play in AD and PD animal models and in patients. Given the apparent changes in PK2 blood levels in both AD and PD patients, the potential clinical value of PK2 either as a disease biomarker or as a therapeutic target for these disorders is discussed.",35410604,PMC9886845,10.2174/1570159X20666220411084612,4
Aplysia Neurons as a Model of Alzheimer's Disease: Shared Genes and Differential Expression,"Although Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia in the United States, development of therapeutics has proven difficult. Invertebrate alternatives to current mammalian AD models have been successfully employed to study the etiology of the molecular hallmarks of AD. The marine snail Aplysia californica offers a unique and underutilized system in which to study the physiological, behavioral, and molecular impacts of AD. Mapping of the Aplysia proteome to humans and cross-referencing with two databases of genes of interest in AD research identified 898 potential orthologs of interest in Aplysia. Included among these orthologs were alpha, beta and gamma secretases, amyloid-beta, and tau. Comparison of age-associated differential expression in Aplysia sensory neurons with that of late-onset AD in the frontal lobe identified 59 ortholog with concordant differential expression across data sets. The 21 concordantly upregulated genes suggested increased cellular stress and protein dyshomeostasis. The 47 concordantly downregulated genes included important components of diverse neuronal processes, including energy metabolism, mitochondrial homeostasis, synaptic signaling, Ca++regulation, and cellular cargo transport. Compromised functions in these processes are known hallmarks of both human aging and AD, the ramifications of which are suggested to underpin cognitive declines in aging and neurodegenerative disease.",34664226,PMC8840921,10.1007/s12031-021-01918-3,2
The metabolic spatial covariance pattern of definite idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus: an FDG PET study with principal components analysis,"Identification of patients with idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (iNPH) in a collective with suspected neurodegenerative disease is essential. This study aimed to determine the metabolic spatial covariance pattern of iNPH on FDG PET using an established technique based on scaled subprofile model principal components analysis (SSM-PCA).We identified 11 patients with definite iNPH. By applying SSM-PCA to the FDG PET data, they were compared to 48 age-matched healthy controls to determine the whole-brain voxel-wise metabolic spatial covariance pattern of definite iNPH (iNPH-related pattern, iNPHRP). The iNPHRP score was compared between groups of patients with definite iNPH, possible iNPH (N = 34), Alzheimer's (AD, N = 38), and Parkinson's disease (PD, N = 35) applying pairwise Mann-Whitney U tests and correction for multiple comparisons.SSM-PCA of FDG PET revealed an iNPHRP that is characterized by relative negative voxel weights at the vicinity of the lateral ventricles and relative positive weights in the paracentral midline region. The iNPHRP scores of patients with definite iNPH were substantially higher than in patients with AD and PD (both p < 0.05) and non-significantly higher than those of patients with possible iNPH. Subject scores of the iNPHRP discriminated definite iNPH from AD and PD with 96% and 100% accuracy and possible iNPH from AD and PD with 83% and 86% accuracy.We defined a novel metabolic spatial covariance pattern of iNPH that might facilitate the differential diagnosis of iNPH versus other neurodegenerative disorders. The knowledge of iNPH-associated alterations in the cerebral glucose metabolism is of high relevance as iNPH constitutes an important differential diagnosis to dementia and movement disorders.",37980531,PMC10657637,10.1186/s13195-023-01339-x,0
What to make of equivocal amyloid imaging results,"Introduction:Six patients with equivocal amyloid-PET results are discussed.Methods:Patients underwent clinical/neuropsychological assessment, MRI, and amyloid-PET. Equivocal amyloid-PET was defined as cortical ligand binding with SUVR < 1.40. Follow-up for up to 5 years is presented.Results:6 patients (4 males, 2 females, mean age 71.8 +/- 2.5 years) with equivocal amyloid-PET were included from 136 patients who underwent amyloid-PET (4.4% of cases). Patients had variable language, behavioral, and cognitive deficits. Progression varied from no deterioration to residential care within 3 years.Discussion:Equivocal amyloid-PET should be interpreted cautiously. Improved biomarkers of AD and other neurodegenerative diseases are needed.",32412323,,10.1080/13554794.2020.1764056,1
Senescence Targeting Methods Impact Alzheimer's Disease Features in 3xTg Mice,"Background:Cellular senescence has been associated with neurodegenerative disease and clearance of senescent cells using genetic or pharmaceutical strategies (senolytics) has demonstrated beneficial effects in mouse models investigating individual disease etiologies of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, it has remained unclear if senescent cell clearance in a mouse model exhibiting both plaque and tau pathologies modifies the disease state (3xTg).Objective:To investigate the effects of senescent cell clearance in the 3xTg mouse model.Methods:3xTg mice were treated with senolytics (ABT263 (navitoclax; NAVI), a combination of dasatinib and quercetin (D+Q)), or subjected to transgene-mediated removal of p16-expressing cells (via INK-ATTAC).Results:Senolytic treatments consistently reduced microgliosis and ameliorated both amyloid and tau pathology in 3xTg mice. Using RNA sequencing, we found evidence that synaptic dysfunction and neuroinflammation were attenuated with treatment. These beneficial effects were not observed with short-term senolytic treatment in mice with more advanced disease.Conclusions:Overall, our results further corroborate the beneficial effects senescent cell clearance could have on AD and highlight the importance of early intervention for the treatment of this debilitating disease.",38306030,PMC10939718,10.3233/JAD-230465,0
[Genetic mechanism underlying the resilience to Alzheimer's disease and its prospect for clinical application],"As the most common neurodegenerative disease, Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by progressive cognitive decline and is a major threat to the health of elderly worldwide. Aside from its pathogenesis, delineation of the protective mechanism of AD is also critical for the etiological treatment. AD resilience refers to a protective mechanism which can maintain the cognitive intactness of patients despite of genetic risk factors and/or related pathology. Studies on the genetic mechanism of AD resilience are of great importance for revealing novel mechanisms and therapeutic targets, as well as optimizing polygenic risk score which can facilitate early identification and intervention for individuals at risk.",36453972,,10.3760/cma.j.cn511374-20210828-00699,0
Integrated Positron Emission Tomography/Magnetic Resonance Imaging in clinical diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease,"Alzheimer's disease (AD), a progressive neurodegenerative disease which seriously endangers the health of the aged, is the most common etiology of senile dementia. With the increasing progress of neuroimaging technology, more and more imaging methods have been applied to study Alzheimer's disease. The emergence of integrated PET/MRI (Positron Emission Tomography/Magnetic Resonance Imaging) is a major advance in multimodal molecular imaging with many advantages on the structure of resolution and contrast of image over computed tomography (CT), PET and MRI. PET/MRI is now used stepwise in neurodegenerative diseases, and also has broad prospect of application in the early diagnosis of AD. In this review, we emphatically introduce the imaging advances of AD including functional imaging and molecular imaging, the advantages of PET/MRI over other imaging methods and prospects of PET/MRI in AD clinical diagnosis, especially in early diagnosis, clinical assessment and prediction on AD.",34826792,,10.1016/j.ejrad.2021.110017,5

"Amyloid-Eszett (Aß), a false positive of amyloid-beta (Aβ)","When the Greek letter beta (β) is accidentally confused for the German letter Eszett (ß), and replaced by it, this can lead to some unfortunate consequences in science, academic publishing, and thus the accuracy of the academic record. In this letter, I document the existence - due to this substitution - of a false positive of amyloid-beta (Aβ), namely amyloid-Eszett (Aß), which does not exist. In total, 242 false positives were identified in PubMed. Of these, 21 were published in 2022, and these were examined in more detail.

Narrative review: recent advances in doll therapy for Alzheimer's disease,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a severe neurodegenerative disease which impacts the quality of life in elderly patients and imposes a significant burden to families and caregivers. The prolonged life expectancy and rapidly increasing world population significantly increased the morbidity. Although it has been widely reported that the aggregation of Beta amyloid and neurofilaments is the most significant pathological change. Currently, there is no effective drug therapy for AD, and the potential risks of pharmacotherapy remain concerns. This article reviews the recent research on Doll therapy (DT), a widely used non-drug therapy on AD patients, especially its clinical effectiveness and precautions in treating AD, with an attempt to further alleviate the mental symptoms and improve the health status of AD patients. Thus, nonpharmacological treatments of AD have become an area of intense research interest in recent years. DT is a person-centered therapy that can improve both the mental and cognitive status and the quality of life in AD patients. Although there remains ethical controversy about the DT on AD patients, its positive effect has been proved. Moreover, a standards manual is required to stipulate the range of application, the time course for treatment and withdraw the toy from the patients.",33966426,,10.21037/apm-21-853,1
Surface plasmon resonance biosensors for detection of Alzheimer's biomarkers; an effective step in early and accurate diagnosis,"The rapid and direct detection of biomarkers in biofluids at clinically relevant concentrations faces serious limitations to develop diagnostic criteria for neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). In this regard, the early detection of biomarkers correlated with AD using novel modalities and instruments is at the center of attention. Recently, some newly invented optical-based biosensors namely Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) has been extensively investigated for the detection of biomarkers using a label-free method or by checking interaction between ligand and analyte. These approaches can sense a very small amount of target molecules in the blood and cerebrospinal fluids samples. In this review, the different hypothesis related to AD, and the structural properties of AD biomarkers was introduced. Also, we aim to highlight the specific role of available SPR-based sensing methods for early detection of AD biomarkers such as aggregated β-amyloid and tau proteins. Efforts to better understand the accuracy and efficiency of optical-based biosensors in the field of neurodegenerative disease enable us to accelerate the advent of novel modalities in the clinical setting for therapeutic and diagnostic purposes.",32858422,,10.1016/j.bios.2020.112511,18
Disruption of axonal transport in neurodegeneration,"Neurons are markedly compartmentalized, which makes them reliant on axonal transport to maintain their health. Axonal transport is important for anterograde delivery of newly synthesized macromolecules and organelles from the cell body to the synapse and for the retrograde delivery of signaling endosomes and autophagosomes for degradation. Dysregulation of axonal transport occurs early in neurodegenerative diseases and plays a key role in axonal degeneration. Here, we provide an overview of mechanisms for regulation of axonal transport; discuss how these mechanisms are disrupted in neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, hereditary spastic paraplegia, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease; and discuss therapeutic approaches targeting axonal transport.",37259916,PMC10232001,10.1172/JCI168554,11
The dawn of pirna research in various neuronal disorders,"Small non-coding PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) silence the expression of transposable elementsof eukaryotic genomes in germline cells. Additionally, piRNAs regulate chromatin modifications, such as trimethylation of histone H3 lysine 9 (H3K9me3) or DNA methylation. In the past decade, the roles of piRNAs have been characterized in somatic cells, including post-mitotic neurons. More recently, piRNAs have been shown to play important roles in brain functions and various neuronal diseases, including neurodegenerative disorders. In this review, we introduce recent findings showing the potential involvement of piRNAs in the etiology of different neurodegenerative diseases, includingamyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD).

Targeting autophagy in Alzheimer's disease: Animal models and mechanisms,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an age-related progressive neurodegenerative disorder that leads to cognitive impairment and memory loss. Emerging evidence suggests that autophagy plays an important role in the pathogenesis of AD through the regulation of amyloid-beta (Aβ) and tau metabolism, and that autophagy dysfunction exacerbates amyloidosis and tau pathology. Therefore, targeting autophagy may be an effective approach for the treatment of AD. Animal models are considered useful tools for investigating the pathogenic mechanisms and therapeutic strategies of diseases. This review aims to summarize the pathological alterations in autophagy in representative AD animal models and to present recent studies on newly discovered autophagy-stimulating interventions in animal AD models. Finally, the opportunities, difficulties, and future directions of autophagy targeting in AD therapy are discussed.",37963840,PMC10802106,10.24272/j.issn.2095-8137.2023.294,2
Alternative Splicing and Hypoxia Puzzle in Alzheimer's and Parkinson's Diseases,"Alternative pre-mRNA splicing plays a very important role in expanding protein diversity as it generates numerous transcripts from a single protein-coding gene. Therefore, alterations lead this process to neurological human disorders, including Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. Moreover, accumulating evidence indicates that the splicing machinery highly contributes to the cells' ability to adapt to different altered cellular microenvironments, such as hypoxia. Hypoxia is known to have an effect on the expression of proteins involved in a multiple of biological processes, such as erythropoiesis, angiogenesis, and neurogenesis, and is one of the important risk factors in neuropathogenesis. In this review, we discuss the current knowledge of alternatively spliced genes, which, as it is reported, are associated with Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. Additionally, we highlight the possible influence of cellular hypoxic microenvironment for the formation of mRNA isoforms contributing to the development of these neurodegenerative diseases.",34440445,PMC8394294,10.3390/genes12081272,5
Role of neuroinflammation in neurodegeneration: new insights,"Previously, the contribution of peripheral infection to cognitive decline was largely overlooked however, the past 15 years have established a key role for infectious pathogens in the progression of age-related neurodegeneration. It is now accepted that the immune privilege of the brain is not absolute, and that cells of the central nervous system are sensitive to both the inflammatory events occurring in the periphery and to the infiltration of peripheral immune cells. This is particularly relevant for the progression of Alzheimer's disease, in which it has been demonstrated that patients are more vulnerable to infection-related cognitive changes. This can occur from typical infectious challenges such as respiratory tract infections, although a number of specific viral, bacterial, and fungal pathogens have also been associated with the development of the disease. To date, it is not clear whether these microorganisms are directly related to Alzheimer's disease progression or if they are opportune pathogens that easily colonize those with dementia and exacerbate the ongoing inflammation observed in these individuals. This review will discuss the impact of each of these challenges, and examine the changes known to occur with age in the peripheral immune system, which may contribute to the age-related vulnerability to infection-induced cognitive decline.",28259169,PMC5336609,10.1186/s13195-017-0241-2,111
The Brain Donation Program in South Korea,"Purpose:Obtaining brain tissue is critical to definite diagnosis and to furthering understanding of neurodegenerative diseases. The present authors have maintained the National Neuropathology Reference and Diagnostic Laboratories for Dementia in South Korea since 2016. We have built a nationwide brain bank network and are collecting brain tissues from patients with neurodegenerative diseases. We are aiming to facilitate analyses of clinic-pathological and image-pathological correlations of neurodegenerative disease and to broaden understanding thereof.Materials and methods:We recruited participants through two routes: from memory clinics and the community. As a baseline evaluation, clinical interviews, a neurological examination, laboratory tests, neuropsychological tests, and MRI were undertaken. Some patients also underwent amyloid PET.Results:We recruited 105 participants, 70 from clinics and 35 from the community. Among them, 11 died and were autopsied. The clinical diagnoses of the autopsied patients included four with Alzheimer's disease (AD), two with subcortical vascular dementia, two with non-fluent variant primary progressive aphasia, one with leukoencephalopathy, one with frontotemporal dementia (FTD), and one with Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD). Five patients underwent amyloid PET: two with AD, one with mixed dementia, one with FTD, and one with CJD.Conclusion:The clinical and neuropathological information to be obtained from this cohort in the future will provide a deeper understanding of the neuropathological mechanisms of cognitive impairment in Asia, especially Korea.",30450854,PMC6240560,10.3349/ymj.2018.59.10.1197,2
"Mangosteen Pericarp and Its Bioactive Xanthones: Potential Therapeutic Value in Alzheimer's Disease, Parkinson's Disease, and Depression with Pharmacokinetic and Safety Profiles","Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), and depression are growing burdens for society globally, partly due to a lack of effective treatments. Mangosteen (Garcinia mangostanaL.,) pericarp (MP) and its xanthones may provide therapeutic advantages for these disorders. In this review, we discuss potential therapeutic value of MP-derived agents in AD, PD, and depression with their pharmacokinetic and safety profiles. MP-derived agents have shown multifunctional effects including neuroprotective, antioxidant, and anti-neuroinflammatory actions. In addition, they target specific disease pathologies, such as amyloid beta production and deposition as well as cholinergic dysfunction in AD; α-synuclein aggregation in PD; and modulation of monoamine disturbance in depression. Particularly, the xanthone derivatives, including α-mangostin and γ-mangostin, exhibit potent pharmacological actions. However, low oral bioavailability and poor brain penetration may limit their therapeutic applications. These challenges can be overcome in part by administering as a form of MP extract (MPE) or using specific carrier systems. MPE and α-mangostin are generally safe and well-tolerated in animals. Furthermore, mangosteen-based products are safe for humans. Therefore, MPE and its bioactive xanthones are promising candidates for the treatment of AD, PD, and depression. Further studies including clinical trials are essential to decipher their efficacy, and pharmacokinetic and safety profiles in these disorders.",32867357,PMC7504283,10.3390/ijms21176211,15
Spatio-temporal convolution for classification of alzheimer disease and mild cognitive impairment,"Background and objective:Dementia refers to the loss of memory and other cognitive abilities. Alzheimer's disease (AD), which patients eventually die from, is the most common cause of dementia. In USA, %60 to %80 of dementia cases, are caused by AD. An estimate of 5.2 million people from all age groups have been diagnosed with AD in 2014. Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a preliminary stage of dementia with noticeable changes in patient's cognitive abilities. Individuals, who bear MCI symptoms, are prone to developing AD. Therefore, identification of MCI patients is very critical for a plausible treatment before it reaches to AD, the irreversible stage of this neurodegenerative disease.Methods:Development of machine learning algorithms have recently gained a significant pace in early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). In this study, a (2+1)D convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture has been proposed to distinguish mild cognitive impairment (MCI) from AD, based on structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). MRI scans of AD and MCI subjects were procured from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. 507 scans of 223 AD patients and 507 scans of 204 MCI patients were obtained for the computational experiments.Results:The outcome and robustness of 2D convolutions, 3D convolutions and (2+1)D convolutions were compared. The CNN algorithms incorporated 2 to 6 convolutional layers, depending on the architecture, followed by 4 pooling layers and 3 fully connected layers. (2+1)D convolutional neural network model resulted in the best classification performance with 85% auc score, in addition to an almost two times faster convergence compared to classical 3D CNN methods.Conclusions:Application of (2+1)D CNN algorithm to large datasets and deeper neural network models can provide a significant advantage in speed, due to its architecture handling images in spatial and temporal dimensions separately.",35636355,,10.1016/j.cmpb.2022.106825,0
The Worldwide Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative: An update,"The Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), launched in 2004, has worked to accelerate drug development by validating imaging and blood/cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease clinical treatment trials. ADNI is a naturalistic (nontreatment) multisite longitudinal study. A true public-private partnership, the initiative has set a new standard for data sharing without embargo and for the use of biomarkers in dementia research. The ADNI effort in North America is not the only such effort in the world. The Alzheimer's Association recognized these global efforts and formed Worldwide ADNI (WW-ADNI). By creating a platform for international collaboration and cooperation, WW-ADNI's goals are to harmonize projects and results across geographical regions and to facilitate data management and availability to investigators around the world. WW-ADNI projects include those based in North America, Europe, Japan, Australia, Korea, and Argentina.",26194318,,10.1016/j.jalz.2015.05.008,22
The End of the Beginning of the Alzheimer's Disease Nightmare: A Devil's Advocate's View,"Although there have been so many failures in Alzheimer's disease (AD) modifying trials, there are still many compounds in the pipeline and the hope still remains that the entrance of disease-modifying treatment (DMT) for AD will positively and dramatically change the whole situation of AD treatment. However, if DMT does enter the market, it will be the beginning of a great number of challenges and problems. The current infrastructure for diagnostics of early (pre-dementia) AD does not have the capacity to meet the demands and expectations of the population. Neither is there capacity for treatment monitoring and follow-ups. If screening is considered, there will be a great risk for false positive cases and a great number of people who will have to undergo diagnostics. There will be high costs for diagnostics and treatment initially, while potential benefits will occur much later in other sectors than where the payers for treatment are. Although there are great hopes that prevention of cardiovascular risk factors and changes in lifestyle might impact the risk for dementia, there is still no consensus that this is the case. Finally, the relevance of different AD paradigms such as amyloid and tau is still a matter of discussion, particularly regarding the oldest old.",29710714,,10.3233/JAD-179905,6
Alzheimer's disease genes and autophagy,"Autophagy is a process to degrade and recycle cellular constituents via the lysosome for regulating cellular homeostasis. Its dysfunction is now considered to be involved in many diseases, including neurodegenerative diseases. Many features reflecting autophagy impairment, such as autophagosome accumulation and lysosomal dysfunction, have been also revealed to be involved in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Recent genetic studies such as genome-wide association studies in AD have identified a number of novel genes associated with AD. Some of the identified genes have demonstrated dysfunction in autophagic processes in AD, while others remain under investigation. Since autophagy is strongly regarded to be one of the major pathogenic mechanisms of AD, it is necessary to review how the AD-associated genes are related to autophagy. We anticipate our current review to be a starting point for future studies regarding AD-associated genes and autophagy. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled SI:Autophagy.",27016058,,10.1016/j.brainres.2016.03.018,25
Deep Learning and Machine Learning Algorithms for Retinal Image Analysis in Neurodegenerative Disease: Systematic Review of Datasets and Models,"Purpose:Retinal images contain rich biomarker information for neurodegenerative disease. Recently, deep learning models have been used for automated neurodegenerative disease diagnosis and risk prediction using retinal images with good results.Methods:In this review, we systematically report studies with datasets of retinal images from patients with neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's disease, Parkinson's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and others. We also review and characterize the models in the current literature which have been used for classification, regression, or segmentation problems using retinal images in patients with neurodegenerative diseases.Results:Our review found several existing datasets and models with various imaging modalities primarily in patients with Alzheimer's disease, with most datasets on the order of tens to a few hundred images. We found limited data available for the other neurodegenerative diseases. Although cross-sectional imaging data for Alzheimer's disease is becoming more abundant, datasets with longitudinal imaging of any disease are lacking.Conclusions:The use of bilateral and multimodal imaging together with metadata seems to improve model performance, thus multimodal bilateral image datasets with patient metadata are needed. We identified several deep learning tools that have been useful in this context including feature extraction algorithms specifically for retinal images, retinal image preprocessing techniques, transfer learning, feature fusion, and attention mapping. Importantly, we also consider the limitations common to these models in real-world clinical applications.Translational relevance:This systematic review evaluates the deep learning models and retinal features relevant in the evaluation of retinal images of patients with neurodegenerative disease.",38381447,PMC10893898,10.1167/tvst.13.2.16,0
Application of Next-Generation Sequencing in Neurodegenerative Diseases: Opportunities and Challenges,"Genetic factors (gene mutations) lead to various rare and prevalent neurological diseases. Identification of underlying mutations in neurodegenerative diseases is of paramount importance due to the heterogeneous nature of the genome and different clinical manifestations. An early and accurate molecular diagnosis are cardinal for neurodegenerative patients to undergo proper therapeutic regimens. The next-generation sequencing (NGS) method examines up to millions of sequences at a time. As a result, the rare molecular diagnoses, previously presented with ""unknown causes"", are now possible in a short time. This method generates a large amount of data that can be utilized in patient management. Since each person has a unique genome, the NGS has transformed diagnostic and therapeutic strategies into sequencing and individual genomic mapping. However, this method has disadvantages like other diagnostic methods. Therefore, in this review, we aimed to briefly summarize the NGS method and correlated studies to unravel the genetic causes of neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, epilepsy, and MS. Finally, we discuss the NGS challenges and opportunities in neurodegenerative diseases.",32399804,,10.1007/s12017-020-08601-7,7
Quetiapine Combined with Sodium Valproate in Patients with Alzheimer's Disease with Mental and Behavioral Symptoms Efficacy Observation,"Quetiapine combined with sodium valproate is an effective and more suitable drug treatment for Alzheimer's disease. At present, there are relatively few studies on the combined action mechanism of these two drugs. This study has certain practical value. Alzheimer's disease is a multifaceted, highly genetically heterogeneous neurodegenerative disease. The main clinical manifestations are memory loss, abnormal mental behavior, and loss of various cognitive functions. In order to improve the symptoms of patients with Alzheimer's disease, especially those with mental symptoms, this article combines quetiapine and sodium valproate, two commonly used drugs for the treatment of mental illnesses, and applies them to different levels of Alzheimer's and observes the results of the combination's curative effect. This article introduces Alzheimer's disease and its potential mental behaviors in the method section, and it also introduces the mechanism of action of quetiapine and sodium valproate. For the algorithm, this paper introduces a data mining algorithm to understand the effect of drug efficacy. In the experimental part, firstly, it introduces the experimental objects, the proportion of medicines, and the statistical methods. Secondly, this article covers adverse reactions, inflammatory factors and vascular endothelial indicators, Alzheimer's disease performance, MOAS score, treatment effect evaluation, and satisfaction surveys. It can be seen from the experiment that, in mental behavior, the experimental group decreased from 8.2 before treatment to 0.5, and the control group decreased from 7.1 before treatment to 2.6. It can be seen that the scores of the experimental group changed after receiving the treatment of quetiapine combined with sodium valproate.",35083020,PMC8786510,10.1155/2022/1278092,1
Atomic Force Microscopy Applied to the Study of Tauopathies,"Atomic force microscopy (AFM) is a scanning probe microscopy technique which has a physical principle, the measurement of interatomic forces between a very thin tip and the surface of a sample, allowing the obtaining of quantitative data at the nanoscale, contributing to the surface study and mechanical characterization. Due to its great versatility, AFM has been used to investigate the structural and nanomechanical properties of several inorganic and biological materials, including neurons affected by tauopathies. Tauopathies are neurodegenerative diseases featured by aggregation of phosphorylated tau protein inside neurons, leading to functional loss and progressive neurotoxicity. In the broad universe of neurodegenerative diseases, tauopathies comprise the most prevalent, with Alzheimer's disease as its main representative. This review highlights the use of AFM as a suitable research technique for the study of cellular damages in tauopathies, even in early stages, allowing elucidation of pathogenic mechanisms of these diseases.",38305187,,10.1021/acschemneuro.3c00819,0
Artificial Intelligence Predictor for Alzheimer's Disease Trained on Blood Transcriptome: The Role of Oxidative Stress,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an incurable neurodegenerative disease diagnosed by clinicians through healthcare records and neuroimaging techniques. These methods lack sensitivity and specificity, so new antemortem non-invasive strategies to diagnose AD are needed. Herein, we designed a machine learning predictor based on transcriptomic data obtained from the blood of AD patients and individuals without dementia (non-AD) through an 8 × 60 K microarray. The dataset was used to train different models with different hyperparameters. The support vector machines method allowed us to reach a Receiver Operating Characteristic score of 93% and an accuracy of 89%. High score levels were also achieved by the neural network and logistic regression methods. Furthermore, the Gene Ontology enrichment analysis of the features selected to train the model along with the genes differentially expressed between the non-AD and AD transcriptomic profiles shows the ""mitochondrial translation"" biological process to be the most interesting. In addition, inspection of the KEGG pathways suggests that the accumulation of β-amyloid triggers electron transport chain impairment, enhancement of reactive oxygen species and endoplasmic reticulum stress. Taken together, all these elements suggest that the oxidative stress induced by β-amyloid is a key feature trained by the model for the prediction of AD with high accuracy.",35563628,PMC9104709,10.3390/ijms23095237,5
CNS inflammation and neurodegeneration,"There is an increasing recognition that inflammation plays a critical role in neurodegenerative diseases of the CNS, including Alzheimer's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, and the prototypic neuroinflammatory disease multiple sclerosis (MS). Differential immune responses involving the adaptive versus the innate immune system are observed at various stages of neurodegenerative diseases, and may not only drive disease processes but could serve as therapeutic targets. Ongoing investigations into the specific inflammatory mechanisms that play roles in disease causation and progression have revealed lessons about inflammation-driven neurodegeneration that can be applied to other neurodegenerative diseases. An increasing number of immunotherapeutic strategies that have been successful in MS are now being applied to other neurodegenerative diseases. Some approaches suppress CNS immune mechanisms, while others harness the immune system to clear deleterious products and cells. This Review focuses on the mechanisms by which inflammation, mediated either by the peripheral immune response or by endogenous CNS immune mechanisms, can affect CNS neurodegeneration.",28872464,PMC5617655,10.1172/JCI90609,206
The Role of Impaired Mitochondrial Transport in the Development of Neurodegenerative Diseases,"The fight against neurodegenerative diseases is one of the key direction of modern medicine. Unfortunately, the difficulties in understanding the factors underlying the development of neurodegeneration hinder the development of breakthrough therapeutics that can stop or at least greatly slow down the progression of these diseases. In this review, it is considered the disruption of mitochondrial transport as one of the pathogenesis factors contributing to neurodegeneration using the examples of Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and Huntington's disease. Here, the mechanism of mitochondrial transport under normal conditions and the mechanisms of disturbances for the indicated diseases will be considered.",37519177,,10.31083/j.jin2204086,1
Prostaglandin J2: a potential target for halting inflammation-induced neurodegeneration,"Prostaglandins (PGs) are produced via cyclooxygenases, which are enzymes that play a major role in neuroinflammation. Epidemiological studies show that chronic treatment with low levels of cyclooxygenase inhibitors (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)) lowers the risk for Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD) by as much as 50%. Unfortunately, inhibiting cyclooxygenases with NSAIDs blocks the synthesis of downstream neuroprotective and neurotoxic PGs, thus producing adverse side effects. We focus on prostaglandin J2 (PGJ2) because it is highly neurotoxic compared to PGA1, D2, and E2. Unlike other PGs, PGJ2 and its metabolites have a cyclopentenone ring with reactive α,β-unsaturated carbonyl groups that form covalent Michael adducts with key cysteines in proteins and GSH. Cysteine-binding electrophiles such as PGJ2 are considered to play an important role in determining whether neurons will live or die. We discuss in vitro and in vivo studies showing that PGJ2 induces pathological processes relevant to neurodegenerative disorders such as AD and PD. Further, we discuss our work showing that increasing intracellular cAMP with the lipophilic peptide PACAP27 counteracts some of the PGJ2-induced detrimental effects. New therapeutic strategies that neutralize the effects of specific neurotoxic PGs downstream from cyclooxygenases could have a significant impact on the treatment of chronic neurodegenerative disorders with fewer adverse side effects.",26748744,PMC4801700,10.1111/nyas.12987,13
Regulatory mechanism of circular RNAs in neurodegenerative diseases,"Background:Neurodegenerative disease is a collective term for a category of diseases that are caused by neuronal dysfunction, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are a class of non-coding RNAs without the 3' cap and 5' poly(A) and are linked by covalent bonds. CircRNAs are highly expressed in brain neurons and can regulate the pathological process of neurodegenerative diseases by affecting the levels of various deposition proteins.Aims:This review is aiming to suggest that the majority of circRNAs influence neurodegenerative pathologies mainly by affecting the abnormal deposition of proteins in neurodegenerative diseases.Methods:We systematically summarized the pathological features of neurodegenerative diseases and the regulatory mechanisms of circRNAs in various types of neurodegenerative diseases.Results:Neurodegenerative disease main features include intercellular ubiquitin-proteasome system abnormalities, changes in cytoskeletal proteins, and the continuous deposition of insoluble protein fragments and inclusion bodies in the cytoplasm or nucleus, resulting in impairment of the normal physiological processes of the neuronal system. CircRNAs have multiple mechanisms, such as acting as microRNA sponges, binding to proteins, and regulating transcription. CircRNAs, which are highly stable molecules, are expected to be potential biomarkers for the pathological detection of neurodegenerative diseases such as AD and PD.Conclusions:In this review, we describe the regulatory roles and mechanisms of circRNAs in neurodegenerative diseases and aim to employ circRNAs as biomarkers for the diagnosis and treatment of neurodegenerative diseases.",37864389,PMC11017410,10.1111/cns.14499,0
[Narrative discourse in dementia with Lewy bodies and Alzheimer's disease],"Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) is the second most common form of dementia, after Alzheimer's disease (AD). Subjects with DLB remain under-diagnosed, especially in the early stage of the disease, when they can show subtle neurocognitive disorders similar to subjects with AD. In order to refine the differential diagnosis between these two neurodegenerative diseases and to improve patients' care, our speech therapy study aimed to analyze their ability to tell a story by producing a narrative discourse (ND).Method:25 participants with DLB and 12 participants with AD underwent a ND test based on an illustrated story. The test was selected from the French language assessment corpus GREMOTS. The grading of the ND was done according to the following six parameters: lexicon, syntax, pragmatics, presence of the main actions, quality of discourse and informativeness.Results:In the early stage, a quarter of the participants with DLB are under cut-off score for ND, and this proportion strongly increases in the advanced stage. In contrast, all the participants with AD show a pathological ND in both stages. In the early stage, the ND abilities appear significantly better preserved in participants with DLB than in participants with AD. No difference is found in the advanced stage. This result highlights two distinct language profiles, with the participants with AD being significantly less informative than the participants with DLB in the early stage. Furthermore, the participants with DLB show pathological scores spreading over the six parameters, whereas the participants with AD have more selective impairments. Indeed, the informativeness of participants with AD is 100% pathological while their syntax is 100% preserved.Discussion:These results are encouraging as they could enable speech therapists to better adjust their follow-up according to the linguistic profile of the patients and to educate caregivers more appropriately. Further research on language issues in DLB and AD is essential.",31162120,,10.1684/pnv.2019.0798,0
Methylprednisolone alleviates cognitive functions through the regulation of neuroinflammation in Alzheimer's disease,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease and linked to abnormal deposition of amyloid-β (Aβ), neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), synaptic dysfunction, and neuroinflammation. Despite significant progress in unravelling the pathogenesis of AD, currently main therapeutic interventions is limited to symptomatic alleviation. Methylprednisolone (MP), a synthetic glucocorticoid, is recognized for its extensive anti-inflammatory properties. Our study assessed the neuroprotective effect of MP (25 mg/kg) administration to an Aβ1-42-induced AD mouse model. Our findings demonstrate that MP treatment can ameliorate cognitive impairment in Aβ1-42-induced AD mice and suppress microglial activation in the cortex and hippocampus. RNA-Sequencing analysis reveals that MP ultimately rescues cognitive dysfunction through improving the synapse function and inhibiting the immune and inflammatory processes. Our study suggests that MP could be a promising drug alternative for the treatment of AD, either alone or in combination with other existing drugs.",37197654,PMC10183590,10.3389/fimmu.2023.1192940,3
Modeling the mature CNS: A predictive screening platform for neurodegenerative disease drug discovery,"Background:Mature primary neuronal cultures are an important model of the nervous system, but limited scalability has been a major challenge in their use for drug discovery of neurodegenerative diseases. This work describes a method for improving scalability through the use of larger format microtiter plates while preserving culture quality.New method:Here we describe a method and quality control procedures for growing embryonic day 18 rat hippocampal/cortical neuronal cultures in 384-well microtiter plates for three weeks in vitro.Results:We use these cultures in two assays measuring intracellular lipid vesicle trafficking and synapse density for routine screening of small molecule libraries. Together this culture system and screening platform have successfully identified therapeutics capable of improving cognitive function in transgenic models of Alzheimer's disease that have advanced to clinical trials, validating their translational applicability.Comparison with existing methods:Our method enables the growth of healthy, mature neurons in larger format microtiter plates than in traditional primary neuronal culturing protocols, making it ideal for drug screening and mechanism of action studies.Conclusion:The predictive capacity of this culture system and screening platform provides a method for rapidly identifying novel disease-modifying neurodegenerative therapeutics.",33836174,PMC8217273,10.1016/j.jneumeth.2021.109180,4
Naturally occurring histological findings and Alzheimer's-like pathology in the brain of aging African green monkeys (Chlorocebus sabaeus),"Nonhuman primates (NHPs) are important to study the pathophysiology of neurodegenerative disease and evaluate therapies targeting the central nervous system (CNS). Understanding the age-associated incidence of natural CNS pathology in a given NHP species is critical to assess the safety of potential treatments for neurodegenerative disorders like Alzheimer's disease (AD). We describe background and age-related neuropathology in the St. Kitts African green monkey (AGM), a recognized translational model for neurodegenerative research, additionally defining the age progression of AD-associated neuropathology in this species. Seventy-one AGM brains were examined, representing age groups of 3-6 years (n = 20), 7-9 years (n = 20), 10-15 years (n = 20), and >15 years (n = 11). A subset of brains (n = 31) was assessed immunohistochemically for AD-related pathology, including expressions of Aβ, tau, and GFAP. Age-related microscopic findings included hemosiderosis, spheroid formation, neuronal lipofuscinosis and neuromelanosis, white matter and neuropil vacuolation, astrocytosis, and focal microgliosis. Non-age-related findings included perivascular ceroid-laden macrophages, meningeal melanosis, and vascular mineralization. Immunohistochemistry revealed 4G8-immunopositive Aβ plaques and vascular deposits in the prefrontal, frontal, cingulate, and temporal cortices of nine animals over 15 years of age, with associated increase in GFAP expression. In 12 animals, 11 over the age of 10 years, phosphorylated tau CP13-immunoreactive neurons, neuropil, and oligodendrocyte-like cells were seen in the prefrontal, frontal, cingulate, orbital, temporal, and entorhinal cortices as well as the hippocampus; no neurofibrillary tangles were observed. AD-related pathology showed an age-related development in cognitive-associated areas in the AGM, highlighting the value of the AGM as a natural model for these neurodegenerative diseases.",37279778,,10.1002/cne.25494,0
Neurodegenerative Disorders Treatment: The MicroRNA Role,"Neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Huntington's disease and prion disease are not timely and effectively treated using conventional therapies. This emphasizes the need for alternative therapeutic approaches. In this respect, gene-based therapies have been adopted as potentially feasible alternative therapies, where the microRNA (miRNA) approach has experienced a great explosion in recent years. Because miRNAs have been shown to be implicated in the pathogenesis of several diseases including neurodegenerative diseases, they are intensely studied as candidates for diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers, as predictors of drug response and as therapeutic agents. In this review, we evaluate the feasibility of both direct and indirect miRNA mimics and inhibitors toward the regulation of neurodegenerative-related genes both in vivo and in vitro models, highlight the advantages and drawbacks associated with miRNA-based therapy, and summarize the relevant techniques and approaches attempted to deliver miRNAs to the central nervous system for therapeutic purposes, with particular regard to the exosomes. Additionally, we describe a new approach that holds great promise for the treatment of a wide range of diseases including neurodegenerative disorders. This approach is based on addressing the incorporation of miRNAs into exosomes to increase the quantity and quality of miRNA packed and delivered to the central nervous system and other sites of action.",29357791,,10.2174/1566523218666180119120726,21
Molecular mechanism of Acanthopanax senticosus in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease based on network pharmacology and molecular docking,"Alzheimer's disease is the most common neurodegenerative disease. Acanthopanax senticosus, also known as Ciwujia or Siberian ginseng in Chinese, has a wide range of antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities. The study aims to explore the action mechanism of A. senticosus against Alzheimer's disease using network pharmacology and molecular docking. The active ingredients and targets of A. senticosus were searched through the ETCM database, and Alzheimer's disease-related targets were obtained through the OMIM and GeneCards databases. The Cytoscape 3.7.2 software was used to construct a ""drug-component-target"" relationship network, and the target genes of A. senticosus against Alzheimer's disease were imported into the String database to establish a protein interaction (PPI) network. The Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes gene enrichment analyses were performed through the Metascape database to obtain potential pathways of action of A. senticosus for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease, and the ability of these active ingredients to bind to core targets was then verified by molecular docking. 51 active ingredients were screened from A. senticosus, and 88 effective targets for Alzheimer's disease were screened. Topological and pathway-enrichment analyses revealed that A. senticosus could play a beneficial role in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease by regulating apoptosis and inflammation. Molecular docking results showed that Ciwujianoside B, Chiisanoside, and Ciwujianoside D1 had strong binding abilities to key target proteins (TNFα, IL1β, and CASP3). Collectively, A. senticosus is feasible in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.",36576665,,10.1007/s11030-022-10586-3,0
Lithium: A therapeutic option in Alzheimer's disease and its prodromal stages?,"Experimental data reveal that lithium is capable of attenuating Alzheimer's disease pathology and stimulating adult hippocampal neurogenesis. Clinical studies show procognitive effects in lithium-treated patients with amnestic MCI and Alzheimer's disease. These procognitive effects are associated with changes of CSF biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease. After 3 months of lithium treatment with low lithium levels, a slowing of cognitive decline is observed in patients with Alzheimer's disease. In patients with amnestic MCI with low-dose lithium treatment a trend of a reduced Alzheimer's disease conversion rate and longer cognitive stability was reported. Thus, lithium might be a therapeutic option in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease and its prodromal stages. But its therapeutic efficacy needs further evaluation. Further studies should include head-to-head comparisons with approved dementia treatment options. Due to lithium's therapeutic toxicity a thorough preselection of patients and a closely therapeutic monitoring is necessary. This manuscript is based on a literature review.",34119602,,10.1016/j.neulet.2021.136044,8
Neuroinflammation and microglial activation in Alzheimer disease: where do we go from here?,"Alzheimer disease (AD) is the most common form of neurodegenerative disease, estimated to contribute 60-70% of all cases of dementia worldwide. According to the prevailing amyloid cascade hypothesis, amyloid-β (Aβ) deposition in the brain is the initiating event in AD, although evidence is accumulating that this hypothesis is insufficient to explain many aspects of AD pathogenesis. The discovery of increased levels of inflammatory markers in patients with AD and the identification of AD risk genes associated with innate immune functions suggest that neuroinflammation has a prominent role in the pathogenesis of AD. In this Review, we discuss the interrelationships between neuroinflammation and amyloid and tau pathologies as well as the effect of neuroinflammation on the disease trajectory in AD. We specifically focus on microglia as major players in neuroinflammation and discuss the spatial and temporal variations in microglial phenotypes that are observed under different conditions. We also consider how these cells could be modulated as a therapeutic strategy for AD.",33318676,,10.1038/s41582-020-00435-y,809
Neurodegenerative Pathways in Alzheimer's Disease: A Review,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex neurodegenerative disease that leads to insidious deterioration of brain functions and is considered the sixth leading cause of death in the world. Alzheimer's patients suffer from memory loss, cognitive deficit and behavioral changes; thus, they eventually follow a low-quality life. AD is considered as a multifactorial disorder involving different neuropathological mechanisms. Recent research has identified more than 20 pathological factors that are promoting disease progression. Three significant hypotheses are said to be the root cause of disease pathology, which include acetylcholine deficit, the formation of amyloid-beta senile plaques and tau protein hyperphosphorylation. Apart from these crucial factors, pathological factors such as apolipoprotein E (APOE), glycogen synthase kinase 3β, notch signaling pathway, Wnt signaling pathway, etc., are considered to play a role in the advancement of AD and therefore could be used as targets for drug discovery and development. As of today, there is no complete cure or effective disease altering therapies for AD. The current therapy is assuring only symptomatic relief from the disease, and progressive loss of efficacy for these symptomatic treatments warrants the discovery of newer drugs by exploring these novel drug targets. A comprehensive understanding of these therapeutic targets and their neuropathological role in AD is necessary to identify novel molecules for the treatment of AD rationally.",32851951,PMC8573750,10.2174/1570159X18666200807130637,11
The protective role of exercise against age-related neurodegeneration,"Endurance exercise is a widely accessible, low-cost intervention with a variety of benefits to multiple organ systems. Exercise improves multiple indices of physical performance and stimulates pronounced health benefits reducing a range of pathologies including metabolic, cardiovascular, and neurodegenerative disorders. Endurance exercise delays brain aging, preserves memory and cognition, and improves symptoms of neurodegenerative pathologies like Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, and various ataxias. Potential mechanisms underlying the beneficial effects of exercise include neuronal survival and plasticity, neurogenesis, epigenetic modifications, angiogenesis, autophagy, and the synthesis and release of neurotrophins and cytokines. In this review, we discuss shared benefits and molecular pathways driving the protective effects of endurance exercise on various neurodegenerative diseases in animal models and in humans.",34923167,PMC8761166,10.1016/j.arr.2021.101543,34
Relationship of Apolipoprotein E with Alzheimer's Disease and Other Neurological Disorders: An Updated Review,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other neurodegenerative diseases, for which there is no effective cure, cause great social burden. Apolipoprotein E (APOE) is an important lipid transporter, which has been shown to have a close relationship with AD and other neurological disorders in an increasing number of studies, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target. In this review, we summarize the recent advances in clinical and basic research on the role of APOE in the pathogenesis of multiple neurological diseases, with an emphasis on the new associations between APOE and AD, and between APOE and depression. The progress of APOE research in Parkinson's disease (PD) and some other neurological diseases is briefly discussed.",36736614,,10.1016/j.neuroscience.2023.01.032,2
The Neuro-Inflammatory Microenvironment: An Important Regulator of Stem Cell Survival in Alzheimer's Disease,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disease, characterized by progressive memory loss and cognitive impairment due to excessive accumulation of extracellular amyloid-β plaques and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles. Although decades of research efforts have been put into developing disease-modifying therapies for AD, no ""curative"" drug has been identified. As a central player in neuro-inflammation, microglia play a key role inbrain homeostasis by phagocytosing debris and regulating the balance between neurotoxic and neuroprotective events. Typically, the neurotoxic phenotype of activated microglia is predominant in the impaired microenvironment of AD. Accordingly, transitioning the activity state of microglia from pro-inflammatory to anti-inflammatory can restore the disrupted homeostatic microenvironment. Recently, stem cell therapy holds great promise as a treatment for AD; however, the diminished survival of transplanted stem cells has resulted in a disappointing long-term outcome for this treatment. This article reviews the functional changes of microglia through the course of AD-associated homeostatic deterioration. We summarize the possible microglia-associated therapeutic targets including TREM2, IL-3Rα, CD22, C5aR1, CX3CR1, P2X7R, CD33, Nrf2, PPAR-γ, CSF1R, and NLRP3, each of which has been discussed in detail. The goal of this review is to put forth the notion that microglia could be targeted by either small molecules or biologics to make the brain microenvironment more amenable to stem cell implantation and propose a novel treatment strategy for future stem cell interventions in AD.",38489182,,10.3233/JAD-231159,0
Recent developments with tau-based drug discovery,"Alzheimer's disease (AD), which accounts for three fourth of all cases of dementia, is a major public health problem in modern society and, yet, there is no effective treatment available that can prevent or inhibit this chronic progressive neurodegenerative disease. A major current drug target is intraneuronal abnormally hyperphosphorylated microtubule-associated protein tau which is a histopathological hallmark of this disease and of a family of neurodegenerative diseases called tauopathies. Areas covered: In this review, the authors discuss a growing number of studies that describe the nature and mechanism of tau pathology and various drug discovery options and most recent developments in tau-based therapeutics. PubMed was used to obtain relevant literature while clinicaltrials.gov site and Google search were employed to obtain the latest information on tau based AD clinical trials. Expert opinion: In authors' opinion, loss of neuronal connectivity leads to the hyperphosphorylation of tau and is thus a key therapeutic target. Rescue of neuronal connectivity loss and hyperphosphorylation of tau are most promising approaches. Consequently, tau immunotherapy has a high therapeutic potential.",29493301,,10.1080/17460441.2018.1445084,16
Gram-negative bacteria and their lipopolysaccharides in Alzheimer's disease: pathologic roles and therapeutic implications,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most serious age-related neurodegenerative disease and causes destructive and irreversible cognitive decline. Failures in the development of therapeutics targeting amyloid-β (Aβ) and tau, principal proteins inducing pathology in AD, suggest a paradigm shift towards the development of new therapeutic targets. The gram-negative bacteria and lipopolysaccharides (LPS) are attractive new targets for AD treatment. Surprisingly, an altered distribution of gram-negative bacteria and their LPS has been reported in AD patients. Moreover, gram-negative bacteria and their LPS have been shown to affect a variety of AD-related pathologies, such as Aβ homeostasis, tau pathology, neuroinflammation, and neurodegeneration. Moreover, therapeutic approaches targeting gram-negative bacteria or gram-negative bacterial molecules have significantly alleviated AD-related pathology and cognitive dysfunction. Despite multiple evidence showing that the gram-negative bacteria and their LPS play a crucial role in AD pathogenesis, the pathogenic mechanisms of gram-negative bacteria and their LPS have not been clarified. Here, we summarize the roles and pathomechanisms of gram-negative bacteria and LPS in AD. Furthermore, we discuss the possibility of using gram-negative bacteria and gram-negative bacterial molecules as novel therapeutic targets and new pathological characteristics for AD.",34876226,PMC8650380,10.1186/s40035-021-00273-y,25
Research on Emotion Recognition and Dementias: Foundations and Prospects,"Background:The study of emotion recognition could be crucial for detecting alterations in certain cognitive areas or as an early sign of neurological disorders.Objective:The main objective of the study is to characterize research development on emotion recognition, identifying the intellectual structure that supports this area of knowledge, and the main lines of research attracting investigators' interest.Methods:We identified publications on emotion recognition and dementia included in the Web of Science Core Collection, analyzing the scientific output and main disciplines involved in generating knowledge in the area. A co-citation analysis and an analysis of the bibliographic coupling between the retrieved documents elucidated the thematic orientations of the research and the reference works that constitute the foundation for development in the field.Results:A total of 345 documents, with 24,282 bibliographic references between them, were included. This is an emerging research area, attracting the interest of investigators in Neurosciences, Psychology, Clinical Neurology, and Psychiatry, among other disciplines. Four prominent topic areas were identified, linked to frontotemporal dementia, autism spectrum disorders, Alzheimer's disease, and Parkinson's and Huntington disease. Many recent papers focus on the detection of mild cognitive impairment.Conclusion:Impaired emotion recognition may be a key sign facilitating the diagnosis and early treatment of different neurodegenerative diseases as well as for triggering the necessary provision of social and family support, explaining the growing research interest in this area.",34120903,,10.3233/JAD-210096,3
Repurposing of Tibolone in Alzheimer's Disease,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a debilitating neurodegenerative disease characterised by the accumulation of amyloid-beta and tau in the brain, leading to the progressive loss of memory and cognition. The causes of its pathogenesis are still not fully understood, but some risk factors, such as age, genetics, and hormones, may play a crucial role. Studies show that postmenopausal women have a higher risk of developing AD, possibly due to the decrease in hormone levels, especially oestrogen, which may be directly related to a reduction in the activity of oestrogen receptors, especially beta (ERβ), which favours a more hostile cellular environment, leading to mitochondrial dysfunction, mainly affecting key processes related to transport, metabolism, and oxidative phosphorylation. Given the influence of hormones on biological processes at the mitochondrial level, hormone therapies are of clinical interest to reduce the risk or delay the onset of symptoms associated with AD. One drug with such potential is tibolone, which is used in clinics to treat menopause-related symptoms. It can reduce amyloid burden and have benefits on mitochondrial integrity and dynamics. Many of its protective effects are mediated through steroid receptors and may also be related to neuroglobin, whose elevated levels have been shown to protect against neurological diseases. Its importance has increased exponentially due to its implication in the pathogenesis of AD. In this review, we discuss recent advances in tibolone, focusing on its mitochondrial-protective effects, and highlight how valuable this compound could be as a therapeutic alternative to mitigate the molecular pathways characteristic of AD.",37509151,PMC10377087,10.3390/biom13071115,0
The Role of Cerebellum in Alzheimer's Disease: A Forgotten Research Corner,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex, heterogeneous, and progressive neurodegenerative dementia. Although the majority of AD research has primarily focused on disease-associated alterations of the cortex and hippocampus in the cerebrum, emerging evidence has highlighted the cerebellum's involvement in sleep, cognition, and AD. In this commentary, we discuss a recently published article in Alzheimer's and Dementia, which examines changes in cerebellar electrophysiology, sleep-wake cycles, and neuropathology in APPswe/PS1ΔE9 mice. We also explore the potential role of the cerebellum in AD, offering a fresh perspective on the study of cerebellar involvement in the disease.",37458038,,10.3233/JAD-230381,1
Audiovisual gamma stimulation for the treatment of neurodegeneration,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common type of neurodegenerative disease and a health challenge with major social and economic consequences. In this review, we discuss the therapeutic potential of gamma stimulation in treating AD and delve into the possible mechanisms responsible for its positive effects. Recent studies reveal that it is feasible and safe to induce 40 Hz brain activity in AD patients through a range of 40 Hz multisensory and noninvasive electrical or magnetic stimulation methods. Although research into the clinical potential of these interventions is still in its nascent stages, these studies suggest that 40 Hz stimulation can yield beneficial effects on brain function, disease pathology, and cognitive function in individuals with AD. Specifically, we discuss studies involving 40 Hz light, auditory, and vibrotactile stimulation, as well as noninvasive techniques such as transcranial alternating current stimulation and transcranial magnetic stimulation. The precise mechanisms underpinning the beneficial effects of gamma stimulation in AD are not yet fully elucidated, but preclinical studies have provided relevant insights. We discuss preclinical evidence related to both neuronal and nonneuronal mechanisms that may be involved, touching upon the relevance of interneurons, neuropeptides, and specific synaptic mechanisms in translating gamma stimulation into widespread neuronal activity within the brain. We also explore the roles of microglia, astrocytes, and the vasculature in mediating the beneficial effects of gamma stimulation on brain function. Lastly, we examine upcoming clinical trials and contemplate the potential future applications of gamma stimulation in the management of neurodegenerative disorders.",38115692,,10.1111/joim.13755,2
Alzheimer's disease: the potential of epigenetic treatments and current clinical candidates,"Alzheimer's disease is a progressive and fatal neurodegenerative disease affecting 50 million people worldwide, characterized by memory loss and neuronal degeneration. Current treatments have limited efficacy and there is no cure. Alzheimer's is likely caused by a combination of factors, providing several potential therapeutic targets. One area of interest is the epigenetic regulation of gene expression within the brain. Epigenetic marks, including DNA methylation and histone modifications, show consistent changes with age and in those with Alzheimer's. Some epigenetic regulation has been linked to disease pathology and progression and are the focus of current research. Epigenetic regulators might make promising therapeutic targets yet challenges need to be overcome to generate an efficacious drug lacking deleterious side effects.",32552286,,10.2217/nmt-2019-0034,7
Insight into the Epigenetics of Alzheimer's Disease: A Computational Study from Human Interactome,"Background:Alzheimer&amp;#039;s disease (AD) is the most prevalent neurodegenerative disease throughout the world. Most of the clinical symptoms of AD appear at a very later stage, therefore, the identification of disease markers is essential which can help proper detection of AD at an earlier stage and slow down its progression. Studies have implicated that epigenetic biomarkers, such as DNA methylation, histone modification and non coding RNA mediated regulation serve crucial roles in several disease progression including AD.Objective:The aim of our study was to identify the topologically significant AD-related proteins from experimentally validated human protein-protein interaction database, HPRD (interactome) and find out novel epigenetic biomarkers.Method:In this computational work, we constructed AD specific diseasome from AD genelist and interactome. Using this diseasome we screened the interactome with the help of novel parameters namely degree band and similarity index and identified AD related proteins. Regulatory network involving AD related proteins, not previously known to be associated with AD was constructed. Several network motifs and epigenetic modification patterns of regulators of these motifs were studied.Result:Our study identified computationally predicted 22 epigenetic genes and 11 epigenetic miRs, not previously known to be associated with AD, from the network motifs. Most of these genes and miRs show brain specific expression. Further study on the epigenetic modification patterns of these regulators regarding histone modification, CpG island and lncRNAs strengthened their association in AD.Conclusion:Computationally predicted genes and miRs identified in our study might provide insight into new epigenetic AD therapeutic targets.",27492077,,10.2174/1567205013666160803151101,0
Death-Associated Protein Kinase 1 Phosphorylation in Neuronal Cell Death and Neurodegenerative Disease,"Regulated neuronal cell death plays an essential role in biological processes in normal physiology, including the development of the nervous system. However, the deregulation of neuronal apoptosis by various factors leads to neurodegenerative diseases such as ischemic stroke and Alzheimer's disease (AD). Death-associated protein kinase 1 (DAPK1) is a calcium/calmodulin (Ca2+/CaM)-dependent serine/threonine (Ser/Thr) protein kinase that activates death signaling and regulates apoptotic neuronal cell death. Although DAPK1 is tightly regulated under physiological conditions, DAPK1 deregulation in the brain contributes to the development of neurological disorders. In this review, we describe the molecular mechanisms of DAPK1 regulation in neurons under various stresses. We also discuss the role of DAPK1 signaling in the phosphorylation-dependent and phosphorylation-independent regulation of its downstream targets in neuronal cell death. Moreover, we focus on the major impact of DAPK1 deregulation on the progression of neurodegenerative diseases and the development of drugs targeting DAPK1 for the treatment of diseases. Therefore, this review summarizes the DAPK1 phosphorylation signaling pathways in various neurodegenerative diseases.",31248062,PMC6651373,10.3390/ijms20133131,28
The contribution of the peripheral immune system to neurodegeneration,"Microglial cells are the major immune cells of the central nervous system (CNS), and directly react to neurodegeneration, but other immune cell types are also able to react to pathology and can modify the course of neurodegenerative processes. These mainly include monocytes/macrophages and lymphocytes. While these peripheral immune cells were initially considered to act only after infiltrating the CNS, recent evidence suggests that some of them can also act directly from the periphery. We will review the existing and emerging evidence for a role of peripheral immune cells in neurodegenerative diseases, both with and without CNS infiltration. Our focus will be on amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, but we will also compare to Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease to highlight similarities or differences. Peripheral immune cells are easily accessible, and therefore may be an attractive therapeutic target for neurodegenerative diseases. Thus, understanding how these peripheral immune cells communicate with the CNS deserves deeper investigation.",37231108,,10.1038/s41593-023-01323-6,16
Family History of Alzheimer's Disease and Cortical Thickness in Patients With Dementia,A first-degree family history of Alzheimer's disease reflects genetic risks for the neurodegenerative disorder. Recent imaging data suggest localized effects of genetic risks on brain structure in healthy people. It is unknown whether this association can also be found in patients who already have dementia. Our aim was to investigate whether family history risk modulates regional medial temporal lobe cortical thickness in patients with Alzheimer's disease. We performed high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging and cortical unfolding data analysis on 54 patients and 53 nondemented individuals. A first-degree family history of Alzheimer's disease was associated with left hemispheric cortical thinning in the subiculum among patients and controls. The contribution of Alzheimer's disease family history to regional brain anatomy changes independent of cognitive impairment may reflect genetic risks that modulate onset and clinical course of the disease.,27303063,PMC10852676,10.1177/1533317516653827,3
Mesenchymal stem cell therapies for Alzheimer's disease: preclinical studies,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a chronic, progressive, and fatal neurodegenerative disorder that is characterized by memory failure, cognitive impairment, as well as behavioral and psychological manifestations. Drugs can only moderately manage, but not alleviate, clinical symptoms. Results, based on animal models, have demonstrated that cell therapy is a promising strategy for treating neurodegenerative disorders. The homing effect of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) replaces damaged cells, while some scholars believe that the paracrine effects play a crucial role in treating diseases. In fact, these cells have rich sources, exhibit high proliferation rates, low tumorigenicity, and immunogenicity, and have no ethical concerns. Consequently, MSCs have been used across various disease aspects, such as regulating immunity, nourishing nerves, and promoting regeneration. Deterioration of public health status have exposed both Alzheimer's patients and researchers to various difficulties during epidemics. In this review, we discuss the advances and challenges in the application of mesenchymal stem cell therapy for treatment of Alzheimer's disease.",34213730,,10.1007/s11011-021-00777-6,5
Mapping pathogenic processes contributing to neurodegeneration in Drosophila models of Alzheimer's disease,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia, affecting millions of people and currently lacking available disease-modifying treatments. Appropriate disease models are necessary to investigate disease mechanisms and potential treatments. Drosophila melanogaster models of AD include the Aβ fly model and the AβPP-BACE1 fly model. In the Aβ fly model, the Aβ peptide is fused to a secretion sequence and directly overexpressed. In the AβPP-BACE1 model, human AβPP and human BACE1 are expressed in the fly, resulting in in vivo production of Aβ peptides and other AβPP cleavage products. Although these two models have been used for almost two decades, the underlying mechanisms resulting in neurodegeneration are not yet clearly understood. In this study, we have characterized toxic mechanisms in these two AD fly models. We detected neuronal cell death and increased protein carbonylation (indicative of oxidative stress) in both AD fly models. In the Aβ fly model, this correlates with high Aβ1-42levels and down-regulation of the levels of mRNA encoding lysosomal-associated membrane protein 1, lamp1 (a lysosomal marker), while in the AβPP-BACE1 fly model, neuronal cell death correlates with low Aβ1-42levels, up-regulation of lamp1 mRNA levels and increased levels of C-terminal fragments. In addition, a significant amount of AβPP/Aβ antibody (4G8)-positive species, located close to the endosomal marker rab5, was detected in the AβPP-BACE1 model. Taken together, this study highlights the similarities and differences in the toxic mechanisms which result in neuronal death in two different AD fly models. Such information is important to consider when utilizing these models to study AD pathogenesis or screening for potential treatments.",31823504,PMC7050262,10.1002/2211-5463.12773,4
Paradigms and Success Stories of Natural Products in Drug Discovery Against Neurodegenerative Disorders (NDDs),"Neurodegenerative disorders (NDDs) are multifaceted complex disorders that have put a great health and economic burden around the globe nowadays. The multi-factorial nature of NDDs has presented a great challenge in drug discovery and continuous efforts are in progress in search of suitable therapeutic candidates. Nature has a great wealth of active principles in its lap that has cured the human population since ancient times. Natural products have revealed several benefits over conventional synthetic medications and scientists have shifted their vision towards exploring the therapeutic potentials of natural products in the past few years. The structural mimicking of natural compounds to endogenous ligands has presented them as a potential therapeutic candidate to prevent the development of NDDs. In the presented review, authors have summarized demographical facts about various NDDs including Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), Huntington's disease (HD) and various types of sclerosis in the brain. The significant findings of new active principles of natural origin along with their therapeutic potentials on NDDs have been included. Also, a description of clinical trials and patents on natural products has been enlisted in this compilation. Although natural products have shown promising success in drug discovery against NDDs, still their use is associated with several ethical issues which need to be solved in the upcoming time.",36606589,,10.2174/1570159X21666230105110834,1
Chronic Respiratory Diseases and Neurodegenerative Disorders: A Primer for the Practicing Clinician,"Chronic respiratory disorders represent a world epidemic. Their incidence and prevalence in the world population is increasing, and especially among elderly subjects, they are commonly associated with other pathologies, often generating a status of high clinical complexity. Neurology, internal medicine, and pneumology specialists should be aware of the common background of these disorders in order to treat correctly the patient's comorbid state and optimize the treatment considering potential overlaps. In this review, we aimed to focus on the relationships between chronic respiratory disorders and chronic neurodegenerative diseases at different levels; we review the shared risk factors and the interactions between disorders, the indications to explore respiratory function in neurodegenerative diseases, pathology-pathology and drug-pathology interactions in patients affected by both chronic neurologic and respiratory diseases.",34348307,PMC8740106,10.1159/000518261,3
A Biomimetic Multiparametric Assay to Characterise Anti-Amyloid Drugs,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most widespread form of senile dementia worldwide and represents a leading socioeconomic problem in healthcare. Although it is widely debated, the aggregation of the amyloid β peptide (Aβ) is linked to the onset and progression of this neurodegenerative disease. Molecules capable of interfering with specific steps in the fibrillation process remain of pharmacological interest. To identify such compounds, we have set up a small molecule screening process combining multiple experimental methods (UV and florescence spectrometry, ITC, and ATR-FTIR) to identify and characterise potential modulators of Aβ1-42fibrillation through the description of the biochemical interactions (molecule-membrane Aβ peptide). Three known modulators, namely bexarotene, Chicago sky blue and indomethacin, have been evaluated through this process, and their modulation mechanism in the presence of a biomembrane has been described. Such a well-adapted physico-chemical approach to drug discovery proves to be an undeniable asset for the rapid characterisation of compounds of therapeutic interest for Alzheimer's disease. This strategy could be adapted and transposed to search for modulators of other amyloids such as tau protein.",38069305,PMC10707238,10.3390/ijms242316982,0
Population-Based Approaches to Alzheimer's Disease Prevention,"Progress in prevention and treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and dementia is hampered by the restricted understanding of the biological and environmental causes underlying pathophysiology. It is widely accepted that certain genetic factors are associated with AD and a number of lifestyle and other environmental characteristics have also been linked to dementia risk. However, interactions between genes and the environment are not yet well understood, and coordinated global action is required to utilize existing cohorts and other resources effectively and efficiently to identify new avenues for dementia prevention. This chapter provides a brief summary of current research on risk and protective factors and opportunities and challenges in relation to population-based approaches are discussed.",29512063,,10.1007/978-1-4939-7704-8_2,1
Factors that predict diagnostic stability in neurodegenerative dementia,"Objective:To determine the frequency and characteristics of clinical diagnostic change in frontotemporal dementia (FTD)-spectrum syndromes and Alzheimer's disease (AD)-type dementia.Methods:We reviewed records and categorized diagnostic changes in patients seen ≥ 2 times with behavioral variant FTD (bvFTD, n = 99), nonfluent and semantic variant primary progressive aphasia (nfvPPA, n = 32; svPPA, n = 59), corticobasal syndrome (CBS, n = 40), progressive supranuclear palsy-Richardson syndrome (PSP-RS, n = 34), and AD-type dementia (n = 49). For bvFTD, we compared patients with and without diagnostic change, and assessed predictors of diagnostic change by logistic regression.Results:Initial diagnoses changed infrequently at subsequent visits in svPPA (6.8%), PSP-RS (8.8%), and nfvPPA (12.5%), with rare changes largely involving clinicopathological overlap or diagnostic ambiguity. Changes in AD-type dementia (30.6%) and CBS (37.5%) were more common, but reflected greater specificity, predicted co-pathology, or overlapping syndromes. Diagnostic change in bvFTD was also common (32.3%), but more diverse, including motor neuron disease development, alternative neurodegenerative syndromes, and non-neurodegenerative diseases. Diagnostic change occurred more often in those who met possible rather than probable bvFTD criteria (70.6% vs 15.3%, p < 0.001). Patients with stable diagnoses showed greater overall impairment, bvFTD behavioral severity, and atrophy in core right-hemisphere bvFTD regions. Patients with diagnostic change had more severe depression (p < 0.05) and more frequent contributing, secondary diagnoses (p = 0.01), such as cerebrovascular disease. By logistic regression, the accuracy of predicting stable bvFTD diagnoses using first-visit data was 80%.Conclusion:bvFTD displays more diverse diagnostic change than other neurodegenerative syndromes. First-visit bvFTD diagnoses may waver if based on meeting possible criteria only.",31102021,PMC6641991,10.1007/s00415-019-09362-5,6
[The role of steroid hormones in the neurodegenerative diseases],"An increasing number of elders in a general population and longer life expectancy have a negative outcome in the growth of dissemination of neurodegenerative diseases (NDs). The NDs like Alzheimer’s disease (AD), Parkinson’s disease (PD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) show sex-dependent prevalence. It is considered that sex steroids could influence on the NDs occurrence. Epidemiological studies indicate that women suffer more frequently from AD, whereas men from PD and ALS. Research suggest neuroprotective effects of estrogens and confirm that factors reducing their level may have a contribution to a higher morbidity rate to NDs. Adverse effects of androgens on NDs have been noticed, however some data suggest their beneficial actions. Therefore, the understanding of the potential role of sex steroids and their receptors in the pathogenesis and course of NDs would contribute to broadening the knowledge of molecular mechanisms leading to NDs. Moreover effective prevention and treatment could be assessed in the future.",36649137,,10.18388/pb.2021_468,0
Alzheimer's Disease: From Mitochondrial Perturbations to Mitochondrial Medicine,"Age-related neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) are distressing conditions causing countless levels of suffering for which treatment is often insufficient or inexistent. Considered to be the most common cause of dementia and an incurable, progressive neurodegenerative disorder, the intricate pathogenic mechanisms of AD continue to be revealed and, consequently, an effective treatment needs to be developed. Among the diverse hypothesis that have been proposed to explain AD pathogenesis, the one concerning mitochondrial dysfunction has raised as one of the most discussed with an actual acceptance in the field. It posits that manipulating mitochondrial function and understanding the deficits that result in mitochondrial injury may help to control and/or limit the development of AD. To achieve such goal, the concept of mitochondrial medicine places itself as a promising gathering of strategies to directly manage the major insidious disturbances of mitochondrial homeostasis as well as attempts to directly or indirectly manage its consequences in the context of AD. The aim of this review is to summarize the evolution that occurred from the establishment of mitochondrial homeostasis perturbation as masterpieces in AD pathogenesis up until the development of mitochondrial medicine. Following a brief glimpse in the past and current hypothesis regarding the triad of aging, mitochondria and AD, this manuscript will address the major mechanisms currently believed to participate in above mentioned events. Both pharmacological and lifestyle interventions will also be reviewed as AD-related mitochondrial therapeutics.",27327899,PMC8028979,10.1111/bpa.12402,26
Visual short-term memory impairments in presymptomatic familial Alzheimer's disease: A longitudinal observational study,"Visual short-term memory (VSTM) deficits including VSTM binding have been associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD) from preclinical to dementia stages, cross-sectionally. Yet, longitudinal investigations are lacking. The objective of this study was to evaluate VSTM function longitudinally and in relation to expected symptom onset in a cohort of familial Alzheimer's disease. Ninety-nine individuals (23 presymptomatic; 9 symptomatic and 67 controls) were included in an extension cross-sectional study and a sub-sample of 48 (23 presymptomatic carriers, 6 symptomatic and 19 controls), attending two to five visits with a median interval of 1.3 years, included in the longitudinal study. Participants completed the ""What was where?"" relational binding task (which measures memory for object identification, localisation and object-location binding under different conditions of memory load and delay), neuropsychology assessments and genetic testing. Compared to controls, presymptomatic carriers within 8.5 years of estimated symptom onset showed a faster rate of decline in localisation performance in long-delay conditions (4s) and in traditional neuropsychology measures of verbal episodic memory. This study represents the first longitudinal VSTM investigation and shows that changes in memory resolution may be sensitive to tracking cognitive decline in preclinical AD at least as early as changes in the more traditional verbal episodic memory tasks.",34560142,PMC8589962,10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2021.108028,3
Circulating Biomarker Panels in Alzheimer's Disease,"The early diagnosis of diseases frequently represents an important unmet clinical need supporting in-time treatment of pathologies. This also applies to neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common form of dementia, estimated to affect millions of individuals worldwide. The respective diagnostic and prognostic markers, especially for the preclinical stages of AD, are expected to improve patients' outcome significantly. In the last decades, many approaches to detecting AD have been developed, including markers to discover changes in amyloid-β levels [from cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) or using positron emission tomography] or other brain imaging technologies such as structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), functional-connectivity MRI or task-related functional MRI. A major challenge is the detection of AD using minimally or even noninvasive biomarkers from body fluids such as plasma or serum. Circulating biomarker candidates based on mRNAs or proteins measured from blood cells, plasma or serum have been proposed for various pathologies including AD. As for other diseases, there is a tendency to use marker signatures obtained by high-throughput approaches, which allow the generation of profiles of hundreds to thousands of biomarkers simultaneously [microarrays, mass spectrometry or next-generation sequencing (NGS)]. Beyond mRNAs and proteins, recent approaches have measured small noncoding RNA (so-called microRNA) profiles in AD patients' blood samples using NGS or array-based technologies. Generally, the development of marker panels is in its early stages and requires further, substantial clinical validation. In this review, we provide an overview of different circulating AD biomarkers, starting with a brief summary of CSF markers and focusing on novel biomarker signatures such as small noncoding RNA profiles.",25720553,,10.1159/000375236,17
Alzheimer's Disease Diagnosis Based on the EEG Analysis,"Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease that usually hurts the central nervous system. By detecting and intervening in the early stage, AD patients could be prevented from memory loss and function decrease. Electroencephalography (EEG) is the recording of the brain's electric action, which reflects the activity of nervous in the brain. Recent studies showed that AD patients' brain action will change in the early stage, and EEG might become a potential marker for AD's early diagnosis. To record and analyze the abnormal transformation in the brain with EEG, researchers and engineers has developed approaches to extract and analyze EEG feature. For the feature extraction, power spectrum analysis, event-related potentials (ERPs) and connectivity analysis could be as the marker for AD diagnosis. And in the feature analysis, Deep learning algorithms such as convolutional neural network (CNN), transfer learning (TL) and generative adversarial network (GAN) could help the automatic diagnosis of AD in the clinic. Based on above review, this article compares advantages and disadvantages of the AD diagnosis based on EEG analysis. In the discussion, different approaches for EEG analysis used in the clinic for AD patients will be introduced and compared.",38007786,,10.3233/SHTI230887,0
Abnormal Structural Brain Connectome in Individuals with Preclinical Alzheimer's Disease,"Alzheimer's disease has a long preclinical phase during which amyloid pathology and neurodegeneration accumulate in the brain without producing overt cognitive deficits. It is currently unclear whether these early disease stages are associated with a progressive disruption in the communication between brain regions that subsequently leads to cognitive decline and dementia. In this study we assessed the organization of structural networks in cognitively normal (CN) individuals harboring amyloid pathology (A+N-), neurodegeneration (A-N+), or both (A+N+) from the prospective and longitudinal Swedish BioFINDER study. We combined graph theory with diffusion tensor imaging to investigate integration, segregation, and centrality measures in the brain connectome in the previous groups. At baseline, our findings revealed a disrupted network topology characterized by longer paths, lower efficiency, increased clustering and modularity in CN A-N+ and CN A+N+, but not in CN A+N-. After 2 years, CN A+N+ showed significant abnormalities in all global network measures, whereas CN A-N+ only showed abnormalities in the global efficiency. Network connectivity and organization were associated with memory in CN A+N+ individuals. Altogether, our findings suggest that amyloid pathology is not sufficient to disrupt structural network topology, whereas neurodegeneration is.",29028937,,10.1093/cercor/bhx236,19
Alzheimer's disease and synapse Loss: What can we learn from induced pluripotent stem Cells?,"Background:Synaptic dysfunction is a major contributor to Alzheimeŕs disease (AD) pathogenesis in addition to the formation of neuritic β-amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles of hyperphosphorylated Tau protein. However, how these features contribute to synaptic dysfunction and axonal loss remains unclear. While years of considerable effort have been devoted to gaining an improved understanding of this devastating disease, the unavailability of patient-derived tissues, considerable genetic heterogeneity, and lack of animal models that faithfully recapitulate human AD have hampered the development of effective treatment options. Ongoing progress in human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC) technology has permitted the derivation of patient- and disease-specific stem cells with unlimited self-renewal capacity. These cells can differentiate into AD-affected cell types, which support studies of disease mechanisms, drug discovery, and the development of cell replacement therapies in traditional and advanced cell culture models.Aim of review:To summarize current hiPSC-based AD models, highlighting the associated achievements and challenges with a primary focus on neuron and synapse loss.Key scientific concepts of review:We aim to identify how hiPSC models can contribute to understanding AD-associated synaptic dysfunction and axonal loss. hiPSC-derived neural cells, astrocytes, and microglia, as well as more sophisticated cellular organoids, may represent reliable models to investigate AD and identify early markers of AD-associated neural degeneration.",36646419,PMC10703628,10.1016/j.jare.2023.01.006,6
Neuronal cell cycle reentry events in the aging brain are more prevalent in neurodegeneration and lead to cellular senescence,"Increasing evidence indicates that terminally differentiated neurons in the brain may recommit to a cell cycle-like process during neuronal aging and under disease conditions. Because of the rare existence and random localization of these cells in the brain, their molecular profiles and disease-specific heterogeneities remain unclear. Through a bioinformatics approach that allows integrated analyses of multiple single-nucleus transcriptome datasets from human brain samples, these rare cell populations were identified and selected for further characterization. Our analyses indicated that these cell cycle-related events occur predominantly in excitatory neurons and that cellular senescence is likely their immediate terminal fate. Quantitatively, the number of cell cycle re-engaging and senescent neurons decreased during the normal brain aging process, but in the context of late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD), these cells accumulate instead. Transcriptomic profiling of these cells suggested that disease-specific differences were predominantly tied to the early stage of the senescence process, revealing that these cells presented more proinflammatory, metabolically deregulated, and pathology-associated signatures in disease-affected brains. Similarly, these general features of cell cycle re-engaging neurons were also observed in a subpopulation of dopaminergic neurons identified in the Parkinson's disease (PD)-Lewy body dementia (LBD) model. An extended analysis conducted in a mouse model of brain aging further validated the ability of this bioinformatics approach to determine the robust relationship between the cell cycle and senescence processes in neurons in this cross-species setting.",38652714,PMC11037540,10.1371/journal.pbio.3002559,0
Electrochemical biosensors for biometal-protein interactions in neurodegenerative diseases,"Electrochemical biosensors have been adopted into a wide range of applications in the study of biometal-protein interactions in neurodegenerative diseases. Transition metals such as zinc, copper, and iron that are significant to biological functions have been shown to have strong implications in the progressive neural degeneration in Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), and prion protein diseases. This review presents a summative examination of the progress made in the design, fabrication, and applications of electrochemical biosensors in recent literature at understanding the metal-protein interactions in neurodegenerative diseases. The focus will be drawn on disease-causing biomarkers such as amyloid-β (Aβ) and tau proteins for AD, α-synuclein (α-syn) for PD, and prion proteins (PrP). Topics such as the use of electrochemical biosensing in monitoring biometal-induced conformational changes, elucidation of complexation motifs, production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) as well as the influence on downstream biomolecular interactions will be discussed. Major results and important concepts presented in these studies will be summarized in the hope to spark inspiration for the next generation of electrochemical sensors.",33578115,,10.1016/j.bios.2021.113035,2
Therapeutic potential of natural molecules against Alzheimer's disease via SIRT1 modulation,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease mainly characterized by progressive cognitive dysfunction and memory impairment. Recent studies have shown that regulating silent information regulator 1 (SIRT1) expression has a significant neuroprotective effect, and SIRT1 may become a new therapeutic target for AD. Natural molecules are an important source of drug development for use in AD therapy and may regulate a wide range of biological events by regulating SIRT1 as well as other SIRT1-mediated signaling pathways. This review aims to summarize the correlation between SIRT1 and AD and to identify in vivo and in vitro studies investigating the anti-AD properties of natural molecules as modulators of SIRT1 and SIRT1-mediated signaling pathways. A literature search was conducted for studies published between January 2000 and October 2022 using various literature databases, including Web of Science, PubMed, Google Scholar, Science Direct, and EMBASE. Natural molecules, such as resveratrol, quercetin, icariin, bisdemethoxycurcumin, dihydromyricetin, salidroside, patchouli, sesamin, rhein, ligustilide, tetramethoxyflavanone, 1-theanine, schisandrin, curcumin, betaine, pterostilbene, ampelopsin, schisanhenol, and eriodictyol, have the potential to modulate SIRT1 and SIRT1 signaling pathways, thereby combating AD. The natural molecules modulating SIRT1 discussed in this review provide a potentially novel multi-mechanistic therapeutic strategy for AD. However, future clinical trials need to be conducted to further investigate their beneficial properties and to determine the safety and efficacy of SIRT1 natural activators against AD.",36878051,,10.1016/j.biopha.2023.114474,5
ETHICAL AND GENETIC ASPECTS REGARDING PRESYMPTOMATIC TESTING FOR NEURODEGENERATIVE DISEASES,"Neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's dementia, Huntington's chorea, Parkinson's disease or spinocerebellar ataxia, manifests into adulthood with an insidious onset, slowly of progressive symptoms. All of these diseases are characterized by presimptomatic stages that preceded with many years of clinical debut. In Parkinson's disease, more than half of the dopaminergic neurons of the black substance are lost before the advent of motor characteristic manifestations. In Huntington's chorea, the progressive neurodegenerative disease could be diagnose prenatal and presymptomatic by analyse of the number of CAG repeats in exon 1 of the huntingtin gene. A similar mechanism represented by expansion of trinucleotide repeats during hereditary transmission from parents to children was identified in fragile X syndrome, spinocerebellar ataxia, spinal muscular and bulbar atrophy, or myotonic dystrophy. Presymptomatic diagnosis in all these progressive diseases raise many ethical issues, due to the psychological impact that can cause the prediction of a disease for which there is currently no curative treatment. Therefore, a positive result can produce serious psychological trauma and major changes in the lifestyle of the individual, instead, a negative result can bring joy and tranquillity. But the problem arises if presymptomatic testing in these neurodegenerative diseases brings greater benefits compared to the possible psychological damage, which can add the risk of stigmatization or discrimination.",27125067,,,2
Diagnostic Value of Subjective Memory Complaints Assessed with a Single Item in Dominantly Inherited Alzheimer's Disease: Results of the DIAN Study,"Objective:We examined the diagnostic value of subjective memory complaints (SMCs) assessed with a single item in a large cross-sectional cohort consisting of families with autosomal dominant Alzheimer's disease (ADAD) participating in the Dominantly Inherited Alzheimer Network (DIAN).Methods:The baseline sample of 183 mutation carriers (MCs) and 117 noncarriers (NCs) was divided according to Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) scale into preclinical (CDR 0; MCs: n = 107; NCs: n = 109), early symptomatic (CDR 0.5; MCs: n = 48; NCs: n = 8), and dementia stage (CDR ≥ 1; MCs: n = 28; NCs: n = 0). These groups were subdivided by the presence or absence of SMCs.Results:At CDR 0, SMCs were present in 12.1% of MCs and 9.2% of NCs (P = 0.6). At CDR 0.5, SMCs were present in 66.7% of MCs and 62.5% of NCs (P = 1.0). At CDR ≥ 1, SMCs were present in 96.4% of MCs. SMCs in MCs were significantly associated with CDR, logical memory scores, Geriatric Depression Scale, education, and estimated years to onset.Conclusions:The present study shows that SMCs assessed by a single-item scale have no diagnostic value to identify preclinical ADAD in asymptomatic individuals. These results demonstrate the need of further improvement of SMC measures that should be examined in large clinical trials.",25922840,PMC4398930,10.1155/2015/828120,5
Anti-inflammatory role of gold nanoparticles in the prevention and treatment of Alzheimer's disease,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease that causes memory and cognitive dysfunction and reduces a person's decision-making and reasoning functions. AD is the leading cause of dementia in the elderly. Patients with AD have increased expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the nervous system, and the sustained inflammatory response impairs neuronal function. Meanwhile, long-term use of anti-inflammatory drugs can reduce the incidence of AD to some extent. This confirms that anti-neuroinflammation may be an effective treatment for AD. Gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) are an emerging nanomaterial with promising physicochemical properties, anti-inflammatory and antioxidant. AuNPs reduce neuroinflammation by inducing macrophage polarization toward the M2 phenotype, reducing pro-inflammatory cytokine expression, blocking leukocyte adhesion, and decreasing oxidative stress. Therefore, AuNPs are gradually attracting the interest of scholars and are used for treating inflammatory diseases and drug delivery. Herein, we explored the role and mechanism of AuNPs in treating neuroinflammation in AD. The use of AuNPs for treating AD is a topic worth exploring in the future, not only to help solve a global public health problem but also to provide a reference for treating other neuroinflammatory diseases.",37615596,,10.1039/d3tb01023f,3
The Phosphoinositide Signal Transduction Pathway in the Pathogenesis of Alzheimer's Disease,"Background:During aging and in age-associated disorders, such as Alzheimer's Disease (AD), learning abilities decline. Probably, disturbances in signal transduction in brain cells underlie the cognitive decline. The phosphorylation/dephosphorylation imbalance occurring in degenerating neurons was recently related to abnormal activity of one or more signal transduction pathways. AD is known to be associated with altered neuronal Ca2+homeostasis, as Ca2+accumulates in affected neurons leading to functional impairment. It is becoming more and more evident the involvement of signal transduction pathways acting upon Ca2+metabolism and phosphorylation regulation of proteins. A growing interest raised around the role of signal transduction systems in a number of human diseases including neurodegenerative diseases, with special regard to the systems related to the phosphoinositide (PI) pathway and AD. The PI signal transduction pathway plays a crucial role, being involved in a variety of cell functions, such as hormone secretion, neurotransmitter signal transduction, cell growth, membrane trafficking, ion channel activity, cytoskeleton regulation, cell cycle control, apoptosis, cell and tissue polarity, and contributes to regulate the Ca2+levels in the nervous tissue.Conclusion:A number of observations indicated that PI-specific phospholipase C (PLC) enzymes might be involved in the alteration of neurotransmission. To understand the role and the timing of action of the signalling pathways recruited during the brain morphology changes during the AD progression might help to elucidate the aetiopathogenesis of the disease, paving the way to prognosis refinement and/or novel molecular therapeutic strategies.",28847278,,10.2174/1567205014666170829100230,7
Molecular Imaging of Neuroinflammation in Neurodegenerative Dementias: The Role of In Vivo PET Imaging,"Neurodegeneration elicits neuroinflammatory responses to kill pathogens, clear debris and support tissue repair. Neuroinflammation is a dynamic biological response characterized by the recruitment of innate and adaptive immune system cells in the site of tissue damage. Resident microglia and infiltrating immune cells partake in the restoration of central nervous system homeostasis. Nevertheless, their activation may shift to chronic and aggressive responses, which jeopardize neuron survival and may contribute to the disease process itself. Positron Emission Tomography (PET) molecular imaging represents a unique tool contributing to in vivo investigating of neuroinflammatory processes in patients. In the present review, we first provide an overview on the molecular basis of neuroinflammation in neurodegenerative diseases with emphasis on microglia activation, astrocytosis and the molecular targets for PET imaging. Then, we review the state-of-the-art of in vivo PET imaging for neuroinflammation in dementia conditions associated with different proteinopathies, such as Alzheimer's disease, frontotemporal lobar degeneration and Parkinsonian spectrum.",28475165,PMC5454906,10.3390/ijms18050993,34
The Influence of Agricultural Work and Plasma Uric Acid on Hospital Admission for Alzheimer's Disease,"Background:Exposure to environmental neurotoxins associated with agricultural work, such as pesticides, may be a risk factor for neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's (AD) and Parkinson's (PD) diseases. There is strong evidence that such exposure is associated with the development of PD; for AD the current evidence is equivocal. Several mechanisms are proposed to mediate this environmental toxicity, one of which is oxidative stress. Uric acid (UA) is an endogenous antioxidant, low levels of which are also implicated in neurodegenerative disease.Objective:This study aimed to determine whether agricultural work was a risk factor for AD in a population in which its association with PD was established, and whether UA was also associated with AD in this cohort.Methods:Hospital records of subjects meeting criteria for AD (n = 128) or vascular dementia (VaD) (n = 178) after hospital admission for symptoms of dementia were studied. History of agricultural work and plasma UA were recorded and their relationship to diagnosis determined.Results:In contrast to previous findings in this population in which agricultural work was strongly associated with PD, a history of agricultural work was not over-represented in hospital admission for AD versus VaD. AD was associated with a reduced level of circulating UA compared with VaD.Conclusion:Agricultural work as a likely proxy for exposure to pesticides appears not to be a risk factor for AD to the extent found in PD, perhaps reflecting their differences in neuronal pathology. Nevertheless, findings with UA suggests that oxidative stress may be an important factor in AD pathogenesis.",36872782,,10.3233/JAD-221226,2
Neuroprotective Effects of Chronic Resveratrol Treatment and Exercise Training in the 3xTg-AD Mouse Model of Alzheimer's Disease,"To date, there is no cure or effective treatment for Alzheimer's disease (AD), a chronic neurodegenerative condition that affects memory, language, and behavior. AD is characterized by neuroinflammation, accumulation of brain amyloid-beta (Aβ) oligomers and neurofibrillary tangles, increased neuronal apoptosis, and loss of synaptic function. Promoting regular exercise and a diet containing polyphenols are effective non-pharmacological approaches that prevent the progression of neurodegenerative diseases. In this study, we measured various conformational toxic species of Aβ and markers of inflammation, apoptosis, endolysosomal degradation, and neuroprotection after 5 months of exercise training (ET), resveratrol (Resv) treatment, or combination treatment in the 3xTg-AD mouse model of AD. Our main results indicate that Resv decreased neuroinflammation and accumulation of Aβ oligomers, increased levels of neurotrophins, synaptic markers, silent information regulator, and decreased markers of apoptosis, autophagy, endolysosomal degradation and ubiquitination in the brains of 3xTg-AD mice. ET improved some markers related to neuroprotection, but when combined with Resv treatment, the benefits achieved were as effective as Resv treatment alone. Our results show that the neuroprotective effects of Resv, ET or Resv and ET are associated with reduced toxicity of Aβ oligomers, suppression of neuronal autophagy, decreased apoptosis, and upregulation of key growth-related proteins.",33020412,PMC7582460,10.3390/ijms21197337,23
Neurodegenerative Diseases and Flavonoids: Special Reference to Kaempferol,"Neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, Multiple Sclerosis and Ischemic stroke have become a major health problem worldwide. Pre-clinical studies have demonstrated the beneficial effects of flavonoids on neurodegenerative diseases and suggest them to be used as therapeutic agents. Kaempferol is found in many plants such as tea, beans, broccoli, strawberries, and neuroprotective effects against the development of many neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson, Alzheimer's disease and Huntington's disease. The present study summarizes the neuroprotective effects of kaempferol in various models of neurodegenerative diseases. Kaempferol delays the initiation as well as the progression of neurodegenerative disorders by acting as a scavenger of free radicals and preserving the activity of various antioxidant enzymes. Kaempferol can cross the Blood-Brain Barrier (BBB), and therefore results in an enhanced protective effect. The multi-target property of kaempferol makes it a potential dietary supplement in preventing and treating neurodegenerative diseases.",33511932,,10.2174/1871527320666210129122033,17
A Pharmacological Appraisal of Neuroprotective and Neurorestorative Flavonoids Against Neurodegenerative Diseases,"Background & objective:Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD) affect an increasing number of the elderly population worldwide. The existing treatments mainly improve the core symptoms of AD and PD in a temporary manner and cause alarming side effects. Naturally occurring flavonoids are well-documented for neuroprotective and neurorestorative effects against various neurodegenerative diseases. Thus, we analyzed the pharmacokinetics of eight potent natural products flavonoids for the druggability and discussed the neuroprotective and neurorestorative effects and the underlying mechanisms.Conclusion:This review provides valuable clues for the development of novel therapeutics against neurodegenerative diseases.",30394219,,10.2174/1871527317666181105093834,5
Shared and unique effects of ApoEε4 and pathogenic gene mutation on cognition and imaging in preclinical familial Alzheimer's disease,"Background:Neuropsychology and imaging changes have been reported in the preclinical stage of familial Alzheimer's disease (FAD). This study investigated the effects of APOEε4 and known pathogenic gene mutation on different cognitive domains and circuit imaging markers in preclinical FAD.Methods:One hundred thirty-nine asymptomatic subjects in FAD families, including 26 APOEε4 carriers, 17 APP and 20 PS1 mutation carriers, and 76 control subjects, went through a series of neuropsychological tests and MRI scanning. Test scores and imaging measures including volumes, diffusion indices, and functional connectivity (FC) of frontostriatal and hippocampus to posterior cingulate cortex pathways were compared between groups and analyzed for correlation.Results:Compared with controls, the APOEε4 group showed increased hippocampal volume and decreased FC of fronto-caudate pathway. The APP group showed increased recall scores in auditory verbal learning test, decreased fiber number, and increased radial diffusivity and FC of frontostriatal pathway. All three genetic groups showed decreased fractional anisotropy of hippocampus to posterior cingulate cortex pathway. These neuropsychological and imaging measures were able to discriminate genetic groups from controls, with areas under the curve from 0.733 to 0.837. Circuit imaging measures are differentially associated with scores in various cognitive scales in control and genetic groups.Conclusions:There are neuropsychological and imaging changes in the preclinical stage of FAD, some of which are shared by APOEε4 and known pathogenic gene mutation, while some are unique to different genetic groups. These findings are helpful for the early identification of Alzheimer's disease and for developing generalized and individualized prevention and intervention strategies.",36850008,PMC9972804,10.1186/s13195-023-01192-y,0
The Role of miR-128 in Neurodegenerative Diseases,"Several neurodegenerative disorders are characterized by the accumulation of misfolded proteins and are collectively known as proteinopathies. Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), and Huntington's disease (HD) represent some of the most common neurodegenerative disorders whose steady increase in prevalence is having a major socio-economic impact on our society. Multiple laboratories have reported hundreds of changes in gene expression in selective brain regions of AD, PD, and HD brains. While the mechanisms underlying these changes remain an active area of investigation, alterations in the expression of noncoding RNAs, which are common in AD, PD, and HD, may account for some of the changes in gene expression in proteinopathies. In this review, we discuss the role of miR-128, which is highly expressed in mammalian brains, in AD, PD, and HD. We highlight how alterations in miR-128 may account, at least in part, for the gene expression changes associated with proteinopathies. Indeed, miR-128 is involved, among other things, in the regulation of neuronal plasticity, cytoskeletal organization, and neuronal death, events linked to various proteinopathies. For example, reducing the expression of miR-128 in a mouse model of AD ameliorates cognitive deficits and reduces neuropathology. Overall, the data in the literature suggest that targeting miR-128 might be beneficial to mitigate the behavioral phenotype associated with these diseases.",37046996,PMC10093830,10.3390/ijms24076024,2
Assessing Genetic Overlap Between Platelet Parameters and Neurodegenerative Disorders,"Neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson's disease (PD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) suffer from the lack of risk-predictive circulating biomarkers, and clinical diagnosis occurs only when symptoms are evident. Among potential biomarkers, platelet parameters have been associated with both disorders. However, these associations have been scarcely investigated at the genetic level. Here, we tested genome-wide coheritability based on common genetic variants between platelet parameters and PD/AD risk, through Linkage Disequilibrium Score Regression. This revealed a significant genetic correlation between platelet distribution width (PDW), an index of platelet size variability, and PD risk (rg[SE] = 0.080 [0.034]; p = 0.019), which was confirmed by a summary-summary polygenic score analysis, where PDW explained a small but significant proportion PD risk (<1%). AD risk showed no significant correlations, although a negative trend was observed with PDW (rg [SE] =-0.088 [0.053]; p=0.096), in line with previous epidemiological reports. These findings suggest the existence of limited shared genetic bases between PDW and PD and warrant further investigations to clarify the genes involved in this relation. Additionally, they suggest that the association between platelet parameters and AD risk is more environmental in nature, prompting an investigation into which factors may influence these traits.",33117333,PMC7575686,10.3389/fimmu.2020.02127,6
Precision Medicine Approach to Alzheimer's Disease: Rationale and Implications,"The neurodegenerative disease field has enjoyed extremely limited success in the development of effective therapeutics. One potential reason is the lack of disease models that yield accurate predictions and optimal therapeutic targets. Standard clinical trials have pre-determined a single treatment modality, which may be unrelated to the primary drivers of neurodegeneration. Recent proof-of-concept clinical trials using a precision medicine approach suggest a new model of Alzheimer's disease (AD) as a chronic innate encephalitis that creates a network insufficiency. Identifying and addressing the multiple potential contributors to cognitive decline for each patient may represent a more effective strategy. Here we review the rationale for a precision medicine approach in prevention and treatment of cognitive decline associated with AD. Results and implications from recent proof-of-concept clinical trials are presented. Randomized controlled trials, with much larger patient numbers, are likely to be significant to establishing precision medicine protocols as a standard of care for prevention and treatment of cognitive decline. Furthermore, combining this approach with the pharmaceutical approach offers the potential for enhanced outcomes. However, incorporating precision medicine approaches into everyday evaluation and care, as well as future clinical trials, would require fundamental changes in trial design, IRB considerations, funding considerations, laboratory evaluation, personalized treatment plans, treatment teams, and ultimately in reimbursement guidelines. Nonetheless, precision medicine approaches to AD, based on a novel model of AD pathophysiology, offer promise that has not been realized to date with monotherapeutic approaches.",37807782,PMC10741308,10.3233/JAD-230467,0
Exploring Multitarget Strategies for Membrane Protection in Alzheimer's Disease,"The exploration of multitarget molecules presents a promising avenue in the quest for effective therapeutic strategies against Alzheimer's disease (AD), a multifactorial neurodegenerative disorder. Traditional single-target drugs have shown limited success due to the complex interplay of pathological processes involved in AD. Multitarget-directed ligands (MTDLs), designed to interact with multiple targets simultaneously, offer a more holistic approach to address the multifaceted nature of neurodegenerative diseases. Recent studies have highlighted the potential of chalcones and huprine derivatives in mitigating amyloid-β peptide-associated toxicity and preserving membrane integrity, crucial for cellular homeostasis. The interaction of these compounds with lipid bilayers may modulate biological responses, opening a new realm of investigation in membrane-centric phenomena. This approach not only broadens the mechanistic understanding of bioactive compounds but also underscores the need for a paradigm shift in AD research, focusing on both intracellular targets and plasma membrane protection for more effective treatment strategies.",37874335,,10.1021/acschemneuro.3c00627,0
"Dysbiosis and Alzheimer's disease: role of probiotics, prebiotics and synbiotics","Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by dementia and the accumulation of amyloid beta in the brain. Recently, microbial dysbiosis has been identified as one of the major factors involved in the onset and progression of AD. Imbalance in gut microbiota is known to affect central nervous system (CNS) functions through the gut-brain axis and involves inflammatory, immune, neuroendocrine and metabolic pathways. An altered gut microbiome is known to affect the gut and BBB permeability, resulting in imbalance in levels of neurotransmitters and neuroactive peptides/factors. Restoration of levels of beneficial microorganisms in the gut has demonstrated promising effects in AD in pre-clinical and clinical studies. The current review enlists the important beneficial microbial species present in the gut, the effect of their metabolites on CNS, mechanisms involved in dysbiosis related to AD and the beneficial effects of probiotics on AD. It also highlights challenges involved in large-scale manufacturing and quality control of probiotic formulations.",37284896,,10.1007/s00210-023-02554-x,3
Use of ocular biomarkers as a potential tool for early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disease worldwide which unfortunately has no known effective cure to date. Despite many clinical trials indicating the effectiveness of preclinical treatment, a sensitive tool for screening of AD is yet to be developed. Due to multiple similarities between ocular and the brain tissue, the eye is being explored by researchers for this purpose, with utmost attention focused on the retinal tissue. Besides visual functional impairment, neuronal degeneration and apoptosis, retinal nerve fiber degeneration, increase in the cup-to-disc ratio, and retinal vascular thinning and tortuosity are the changes observed in the retinal tissue which are related to AD. Studies have shown that targeting these changes in the retina is an effective way of reducing the degeneration of retinal neuronal tissue. Similar mechanisms of neurodegeneration have been demonstrated in the brain and the eyes of AD patients. Multiple studies are underway to investigate the potential of diagnosing AD and detection of amyloid-β (Aβ) levels in the retinal tissue. Since the tissues in the anterior segment of the eye are more accessible for in vivo imaging and examination, they have more potential as screening biomarkers. This article provides a concise review of available literature on the ocular biomarkers in anterior and posterior segments of the eye including the cornea, aqueous humour (AH), crystalline lens, and retina in AD. This review will also highlight the newer technological tools available for the detection of potential biomarkers in the eye for early diagnosis of AD.",32174567,PMC7210832,10.4103/ijo.IJO_999_19,14
Protective effect of daidzein against streptozotocin-induced Alzheimer's disease via improving cognitive dysfunction and oxidative stress in rat model,"Oxidative stress is performing an essential role in developing Alzheimer's disease (AD), and age-related disorder and other neurodegenerative diseases. In existing research, we have aimed at investigating the daidzein (4',7-dihydroxyisoflavone) effect (10 and 20 mg/kg of body weight), as a free radical scavenger and antioxidant in streptozotocin (STZ) infused AD in rat model. Daidzein treatment led to significant improvement in intracerebroventricular-streptozotocin (ICV-STZ)-induced memory and learning impairments that was evaluated by Morris water maze test and spontaneous locomotor activity. It significantly restored the alterations in malondialdehyde, catalase, superoxide dismutase, and reduced glutathione levels. In addition, histopathological observations in cerebral cortex and hippocampal areas confirmed the neuroprotective effect of daidzein. These outcomes provide experimental proof showing preventive effect of daidzein on memory, learning dysfunction and oxidative stress in case of ICV-STZ rats. In conclusion, daidzein offers a potential treatment module for various neurodegenerative disorders with regard to mental deficits like AD.",30897277,,10.1002/jbt.22319,18
Personalized Protein-Protein Interaction Networks Towards Unraveling the Molecular Mechanisms of Alzheimer's Disease,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a highly heterogenous neurodegenerative disease, and several omic-based datasets were generated in the last decade from the patients with the disease. However, the vast majority of studies evaluate these datasets in bulk by considering all the patients as a single group, which obscures the molecular differences resulting from the heterogeneous nature of the disease. In this study, we adopted a personalized approach and analyzed the transcriptome data from 403 patients individually by mapping the data on a human protein-protein interaction network. Patient-specific subnetworks were discovered and analyzed in terms of the genes in the subnetworks, enriched functional terms, and known AD genes. We identified several affected pathways that could not be captured by the bulk comparison. We also showed that our personalized findings point to patterns of alterations consistent with the recently suggested AD subtypes.",37855983,,10.1007/s12035-023-03690-4,0
Palmitoylation in Alzheimer's disease and other neurodegenerative diseases,"Posttranslational modifications of proteins are important regulatory processes endowing the proteins functional complexity. Over the last decade, numerous studies have shed light on the roles of palmitoylation, one of the most common lipid modifications, in various aspects of neuronal functions. Major players regulating palmitoylation are the enzymes that mediate palmitoylation and depalmitoylation which are palmitoyl acyltransferases (PATs) and protein thioesterases, respectively. In this review, we will provide and discuss current understandings on palmitoyation/depalmitoylation control mediated by PATs and/or protein thioesterases for neuronal functions in general and also for Alzheimer's disease in particular, and other neurodegenerative diseases such as Huntington's disease, schizophrenia and intellectual disability.",27293050,,10.1016/j.phrs.2016.06.008,59
Cspg4highmicroglia contribute to microgliosis during neurodegeneration,"Microglia play a critical role in the pathogenic process of neurodegenerative diseases, such as Parkinson's disease (PD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). Upon pathological stimulation, microglia are converted from a surveillant to an overactivated phenotype. However, the molecular characters of proliferating microglia and their contributions to the pathogenesis of neurodegeneration remain unclear. Here, we identify chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan 4 (Cspg4,also known as neural/glial antigen 2)-expressing microglia as a specific subset of microglia with proliferative capability during neurodegeneration. We found that the percentage ofCspg4+microglia was increased in mouse models of PD. The transcriptomic analysis ofCspg4+microglia revealed that the subclusterCspg4highmicroglia displayed a unique transcriptomic signature, which was characterized by the enrichment of orthologous cell cycle genes and a lower expression of genes responsible for neuroinflammation and phagocytosis. Their gene signatures were also distinct from that of known disease-associated microglia. The proliferation of quiescentCspg4highmicroglia was evoked by pathological α-synuclein. Following the transplantation in the adult brain with the depletion of endogenous microglia,Cspg4highmicroglia grafts showed higher survival rates than theirCspg4-counterparts. Consistently,Cspg4highmicroglia were detected in the brain of AD patients and displayed the expansion in animal models of AD. These findings suggest thatCspg4highmicroglia are one of the origins of microgliosis during neurodegeneration and may open up a avenue for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases.",36795751,PMC9974490,10.1073/pnas.2210643120,3
"A Randomized, Double-Blind, and Sham-Controlled Trial of an Innovative Brain-Gut Photobiomodulation Therapy: Safety and Patient Compliance","Background:Recent innovative non-pharmacological interventions and neurostimulation devices have shown potential for application in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD). These include photobiomodulation (PBM) therapy.Objective:This pilot study assesses the safety, compliance with, and efficacy of a brain-gut PBM therapy for mild-to-moderate AD patients.Methods:This double-blind, randomized, monocentric sham-controlled study started in 2018 and ended prematurely in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Fifty-three mild-to-moderate AD patients were randomized, 27 in the PBM group and 26 in the sham group. All patients had 40 treatment sessions lasting 25 min each over 8 weeks and were followed for 4 weeks afterwards. Compliance with the treatment was recorded. Safety was assessed by recording adverse events (AEs), and efficacy was evaluated using neuropsychological tests.Results:The PBM therapy proved to be safe in regard to the number of recorded AEs (44% of the patients), which were balanced between the PBM and sham groups. AEs were mainly mild, and no serious AEs were reported. The majority of the patients (92.5%) were highly compliant, which confirms the feasibility of the PBM treatment. Compared to the sham patients, the PBM patients showed lower ADAS-Cog comprehension subscores, higher forward verbal spans, and lower TMT-B execution times, which suggests an improvement in cognitive functions.Conclusion:This study demonstrates the tolerability of and patient compliance with a PBM-based treatment for mild-to-moderate AD patients. It highlights encouraging efficacy trends and provides insights for the design of the next phase trial in a larger AD patient sample.",36189591,,10.3233/JAD-220467,5
Subjective cognitive complaints and blood biomarkers of neurodegenerative diseases: a longitudinal cohort study,"Background:Subjective cognitive complaints (SCC) have been mostly studied in the context of Alzheimer's disease in memory clinic settings. The potential of combining SCC with genetic information and blood biomarkers of neurodegenerative diseases for risk assessment of dementia and depression in the absence of dementia among community-dwelling older adults has so far not been explored.Methods:Data were based on a population-based cohort of 6357 participants with a 17-year follow-up (ESTHER study) and a clinic-based cohort of 422 patients. Participants of both cohorts were grouped according to the diagnosis of dementia (yes/no) and the diagnosis of depression in the absence of dementia (yes/no). Participants without dementia included both cognitively unimpaired participants and cognitively impaired participants. Genetic information (APOE ε4 genotype) and blood-based biomarkers of neurodegenerative diseases (glial fibrillary acidic protein; GFAP, neurofilament light chain; NfL, phosphorylated tau181; p-tau181) were available in the ESTHER study and were determined with Simoa Technology in a nested case-control design. Logistic regression models adjusted for relevant confounders were run for the outcomes of all-cause dementia and depression in the absence of dementia.Results:The results showed that persistent SCC were associated both with increased risk of all-cause dementia and of depression without dementia, independently of the diagnostic setting. However, the results for the ESTHER study also showed that the combination of subjective complaints with APOE ε4 and with increased GFAP concentrations in the blood yielded a substantially increased risk of all-cause dementia (OR 5.35; 95%CI 3.25-8.81, p-value < 0.0001 and OR 7.52; 95%CI 2.79-20.29, p-value < 0.0001, respectively) but not of depression. Associations of NfL and p-tau181 with risk of all-cause dementia and depression were not statistically significant, either alone or in combination with SCC, but increased concentrations of p-tau181 seemed to be associated with an increased risk for depression.Conclusion:In community and clinical settings, SCC predict both dementia and depression in the absence of dementia. The addition of GFAP could differentiate between the risk of all-cause dementia and the risk of depression among individuals without dementia.",37951931,PMC10638700,10.1186/s13195-023-01341-3,0
Neuroimaging correlates with neuropathologic schemes in neurodegenerative disease,"Introduction:Neuroimaging biomarkers are important for early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease, and comparing multimodality neuroimaging to autopsy data is essential.Methods:We compared the pathologic findings from a prospective autopsy cohort (n = 100) to Pittsburgh compound B PET (PiB-PET),18F-fluorodeoxyglucose PET (FDG-PET), and MRI. Correlations between neuroimaging biomarkers and neuropathologic schemes were assessed.Results:PiB-PET showed strong correlations with Thal amyloid phase and Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease score and categorized 44% of Thal phase 1 participants as positive. FDG-PET and MRI correlated modestly with Braak tangle stage in Alzheimer's type pathology. A subset of participants with ""none"" or ""sparse"" neuritic plaque scores had elevated PiB-PET signal due to diffuse amyloid plaque. Participants with findings characterized as ""suspected non-Alzheimer's pathophysiology"" represented 15% of the group.Discussion:PiB-PET is associated with Alzheimer's disease, neuritic plaques, and diffuse plaques. FDG-PET and MRI have modest correlation with neuropathologic schemes. Participants with findings characterized as suspected non-Alzheimer's pathophysiology most commonly had primary age-related tauopathy.",31175025,PMC6662599,10.1016/j.jalz.2019.03.016,38
Recent approaches and challenges in iPSCs: modeling and cell-based therapy of Alzheimer's disease,"The lack of effective therapies for different neurodegenerative disorders has placed huge burdens on society. To overcome the restricted capacity of the central nervous system for regeneration, the promising alternative would be to use stem cells for more effective treatment of chronic degenerative and inflammatory neurological conditions and also of acute neuronal damage and from injuries or cerebrovascular diseases. The generation of induced pluripotent stem cells from somatic cells by the ectopic expression of specific transcription factors has provided the regenerative medicine field with a new tool for investigating and treating neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). This technology provides an alternative to traditional approaches, such as nuclear transfer and somatic cell fusion using embryonic stem cells. However, due to a problem in standardization of certain reprogramming techniques and systems research, the induced pluripotent stem cell-based technology is still in its infancy. The present paper is aimed at a brief review of the current status in modeling and cell-based therapies for AD.",26812864,,10.1515/revneuro-2015-0054,2
AD molecular: Imaging tau aggregates with positron emissions tomography,"Pathologic aggregates of tau protein are observed in several neurodegenerative diseases and are used to diagnose and stage disease postmortem. Recent advances in positron emission tomography radioligands allow for the detection of aggregated tau proteins in living persons. This chapter describes the development and characterization of several positron emission tomography radioligands used to detect tau pathophysiology in vivo, and how these ligands are being used in clinical aging and neurodegenerative disease research with a focus on imaging tau aggregates in Alzheimer's disease.",31481160,,10.1016/bs.pmbts.2019.07.007,6
Modelling neurodegenerative diseases with 3D brain organoids,"Neurodegenerative diseases are incurable and debilitating conditions characterized by the deterioration of brain function. Most brain disease models rely on human post-mortem brain tissue, non-human primate tissue, or in vitro two-dimensional (2D) experiments. Resource limitations and the complexity of the human brain are some of the reasons that make suitable human neurodegenerative disease models inaccessible. However, recently developed three-dimensional (3D) brain organoids derived from pluripotent stem cells (PSCs), including embryonic stem cells and induced PSCs, may provide suitable models for the study of the pathological features of neurodegenerative diseases. In this review, we provide an overview of existing 3D brain organoid models and discuss recent advances in organoid technology that have increased our understanding of brain development. Moreover, we explain how 3D organoid models recapitulate aspects of specific neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and Huntington's disease, and explore the utility of these models, for therapeutic applications.",32568450,,10.1111/brv.12626,17
"Melanin: a unifying theory of disease as exemplified by Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, and Lewy body dementia","Melanin, a ubiquitous dark pigment, plays important roles in the immune system, including scavenging reactive oxygen species formed in response to ultraviolet radiation absorption, absorbing metals, thermal regulation, drug uptake, innate immune system functions, redox, and energy transduction. Many tissue types, including brain, heart, arteries, ovaries, and others, contain melanin. Almost all cells contain precursors to melanin. A growing number of diseases in which there is a loss of melanin and/or neuromelanin are increasingly thought to have infectious etiologies, for example, Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), Lewy Body Dementia (LBD), and vitiligo. AD, PD, LBD, and vitiligo have been linked with herpesvirus, which enters melanosomes and causes apoptosis, and with gut dysbiosis and inflammation. Herpesvirus is also linked with gut dysbiosis and inflammation. We theorize that under normal healthy states, melanin retains some of the energy it absorbs from electromagnetic radiation, which is then used to fuel cells, and energy from ATP is used to compliment that energy supply. We further theorize that loss of melanin reduces the energy supply of cells, which in the case of AD, PD, and LBD results in an inability to sustain immune system defenses and remove the plaques associated with the disease, which appear to be part of the immune system's attempt to eradicate the pathogens seen in these neurodegenerative diseases. In addition, in an attempt to explain why removing these plaques does not result in improvements in cognition and mood and why cognitions and moods in these individuals have ebbs and flows, we postulate that it is not the plaques that cause the cognitive symptoms but, rather, inflammation in the brain resulting from the immune system's response to pathogens. Our theory that energy retained in melanin fuels cells in an inverse relationship with ATP is supported by studies showing alterations in ATP production in relationship to melanin levels in melanomas, vitiligo, and healthy cells. Therefore, alteration of melanin levels may be at the core of many diseases. We propose regulating melanin levels may offer new avenues for treatment development.",37841274,PMC10570809,10.3389/fimmu.2023.1228530,1
The existence of Aβ strains and their potential for driving phenotypic heterogeneity in Alzheimer's disease,"Reminiscent of the human prion diseases, there is considerable clinical and pathological variability in Alzheimer's disease, the most common human neurodegenerative condition. As in prion disorders, protein misfolding and aggregation is a hallmark feature of Alzheimer's disease, where the initiating event is thought to be the self-assembly of Aβ peptide into aggregates that deposit in the central nervous system. Emerging evidence suggests that Aβ, similar to the prion protein, can polymerize into a conformationally diverse spectrum of aggregate strains both in vitro and within the brain. Moreover, certain types of Aβ aggregates exhibit key hallmarks of prion strains including divergent biochemical attributes and the ability to induce distinct pathological phenotypes when intracerebrally injected into mouse models. In this review, we discuss the evidence demonstrating that Aβ can assemble into distinct strains of aggregates and how such strains may be primary drivers of the phenotypic heterogeneity in Alzheimer's disease.",32743745,,10.1007/s00401-020-02201-2,25
Study of Tau Liquid-Liquid Phase Separation In Vitro,"Aggregation of the microtubule-associated protein tau is one of the major pathogenic events in Alzheimer's disease and several other neurodegenerative disorders. Recent reports have demonstrated that purified tau can undergo liquid-liquid phase separation in vitro, forming liquid droplets. The protein within these droplets was also found to undergo accelerated transition to fibrillar aggregates, suggesting that LLPS may play an important role in pathological aggregation of tau in neurodegenerative disorders. Here, we describe several protocols for studying LLPS behavior of the recombinant full-length tau by turbidimetric and light microscopy-based methods.",36310207,,10.1007/978-1-0716-2597-2_16,0
Considerations for integrative multi-omic approaches to explore Alzheimer's disease mechanisms,"The past decade has seen the maturation of multiple different forms of high-dimensional molecular profiling to the point that these methods could be deployed in initially hundreds and more recently thousands of human samples. In the field of Alzheimer's disease (AD), these profiles have been applied to the target organ: the aging brain. In a growing number of cases, the same samples were profiled with multiple different approaches, yielding genetic, transcriptomic, epigenomic and proteomic data. Here, we review lessons learned so far as we move beyond quantitative trait locus (QTL) analyses which map the effect of genetic variation on molecular features to integrate multiple levels of ""omic"" data in an effort to identify the molecular drivers of AD. One thing is clear: no single layer of molecular or ""omic"" data is sufficient to capture the variance of AD or aging-related cognitive decline. Nonetheless, reproducible findings are emerging from current efforts, and there is evidence of convergence using different approaches. Thus, we are on the cusp of an acceleration of truly integrative studies as the availability of large numbers of well-characterized brain samples profiled in three or more dimensions enables the testing, comparison and refinement of analytic methods with which to dissect the molecular architecture of the aging brain.",32654306,PMC8018035,10.1111/bpa.12878,8
Understanding the Gut-Brain Axis and Its Therapeutic Implications for Neurodegenerative Disorders,"The gut-brain axis (GBA) is a complex bidirectional communication network connecting the gut and brain. It involves neural, immune, and endocrine communication pathways between the gastrointestinal (GI) tract and the central nervous system (CNS). Perturbations of the GBA have been reported in many neurodegenerative disorders (NDDs), such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), among others, suggesting a possible role in disease pathogenesis. The gut microbiota is a pivotal component of the GBA, and alterations in its composition, known as gut dysbiosis, have been associated with GBA dysfunction and neurodegeneration. The gut microbiota might influence the homeostasis of the CNS by modulating the immune system and, more directly, regulating the production of molecules and metabolites that influence the nervous and endocrine systems, making it a potential therapeutic target. Preclinical trials manipulating microbial composition through dietary intervention, probiotic and prebiotic supplementation, and fecal microbial transplantation (FMT) have provided promising outcomes. However, its clear mechanism is not well understood, and the results are not always consistent. Here, we provide an overview of the major components and communication pathways of the GBA, as well as therapeutic approaches targeting the GBA to ameliorate NDDs.",37960284,PMC10648099,10.3390/nu15214631,5
"A comparative study of acetyl-l-carnitine and caloric restriction impact on hippocampal autophagy, apoptosis, neurogenesis, and astroglial function in AlCl3-induced Alzheimer's in rats","Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a worldwide chronic progressive neurodegenerative disease. We aimed to investigate and compare the neuroprotective impact of acetyl-l-carnitine and caloric restriction (CR) on AlCl3-induced AD to explore the pathogenesis and therapeutic strategies of AD. Sixty-seven adult male Wistar rats were allocated into Control, AlCl3, AlCl3-acetyl-l-carnitine, and AlCl3-CR groups. Each of AlCl3and acetyl-l-carnitine were given by gavage in a daily dose of 100 mg/kg and CR was conducted by giving 70% of the daily average caloric intake of the control group. Rats were subjected to behavioral assessment using open field test, Y maze, novel object recognition test and passive avoidance test, biochemical assay of serum phosphorylated tau (pTau), hippocampal homogenate phosphorylated adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase, Beclin-1, Bcl-2-associated X protein, and B cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl2) as well as hippocampal Ki-67 and glial fibrillary acidic protein immunohistochemistry. AlCl3-induced cognitive and behavioral deficits coincident with impaired autophagy and enhanced apoptosis associated with defective neurogenesis and defective astrocyte activation. Acetyl-l-carnitine and CR partially protect against AlCl3-induced behavioral, cognitive, biochemical, and histological changes, with more ameliorative effect of acetyl-l-carnitine on hippocampal apoptotic markers, and more obvious behavioral and histological improvement with CR.",36988119,,10.1139/cjpp-2022-0304,1
Physical understanding in neurodegenerative diseases,"This quantitative review gives an overview of physical understanding (i.e., the ability to represent and use the laws of physics to interact with the physical world) impairments in Alzheimer's disease (AD), semantic dementia (SD), and corticobasal syndrome (CBS), as assessed mainly with mechanical problem-solving and tool use tests. This review shows that: (1) SD patients have apraxia of tool use because of semantic tool knowledge deficits, but normal performance in tests of physical understanding; (2) AD and CBS patients show impaired performance in mechanical problem-solving tests, probably not because of intrinsic deficits of physical understanding, but rather because of additional cognitive (AD) or motor impairments (CBS); (3) As a result, the performance in mechanical problem-solving tests is not a good predictor of familiar tool use in dementia; (4) Actual deficits of physical understanding are probably observed only in late stages of neurodegenerative diseases, and associated with functional loss.",35549825,,10.1080/02643294.2022.2071152,1
"No Geographic Correlation between Lyme Disease and Death Due to 4 Neurodegenerative Disorders, United States, 2001-2010","Associations between Lyme disease and certain neurodegenerative diseases have been proposed, but supportive evidence for an association is lacking. Similar geographic distributions would be expected if 2 conditions were etiologically linked. Thus, we compared the distribution of Lyme disease cases in the United States with the distributions of deaths due to Alzheimer disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), multiple sclerosis (MS), and Parkinson disease; no geographic correlations were identified. Lyme disease incidence per US state was not correlated with rates of death due to ALS, MS, or Parkinson disease; however, an inverse correlation was detected between Lyme disease and Alzheimer disease. The absence of a positive correlation between the geographic distribution of Lyme disease and the distribution of deaths due to Alzheimer disease, ALS, MS, and Parkinson disease provides further evidence that Lyme disease is not associated with the development of these neurodegenerative conditions.",26488307,PMC4622257,10.3201/eid2111.150778,6
"Thyroid dysfunction and Alzheimer's disease, a vicious circle","Recently, research into the link between thyroid dysfunction and Alzheimer's disease (AD) remains a current topic of interest. Previous research has primarily concentrated on examining the impact of thyroid dysfunction on the risk of developing AD, or solely explored the mechanisms of interaction between hypothyroidism and AD, a comprehensive analysis of the mechanisms linking thyroid dysfunction, including hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism, to Alzheimer's disease (AD) still require further elucidation. Therefore, the aim of this review is to offer a thorough and comprehensive explanation of the potential mechanisms underlying the causal relationship between thyroid dysfunction and AD, highlighting the existence of a vicious circle. The effect of thyroid dysfunction on AD includes neuron death, impaired synaptic plasticity and memory, misfolded protein deposition, oxidative stress, and diffuse and global neurochemical disturbances. Conversely, AD can also contribute to thyroid dysfunction by affecting the stress repair response and disrupting pathways involved in thyroid hormone (TH) production, transport, and activation. Furthermore, this review briefly discusses the role and significance of utilizing the thyroid as a therapeutic target for cognitive recovery in AD. By exploring potential mechanisms and therapeutic avenues, this research contributes to our understanding and management of this devastating neurodegenerative disease.",38419953,PMC10899337,10.3389/fendo.2024.1354372,0
Nutritional supplementation for Alzheimer's disease?,"Purpose of review:Evidence for the benefit of nutrition in Alzheimer's disease continues to accumulate. Many studies with individual vitamins or supplements show marginal, if any, benefit. However, new findings with combinatorial formulations demonstrate improvement in cognitive performance and behavioral difficulties that accompany Alzheimer's disease. Herein, we review some of the most recent clinical advances and summarize supportive preclinical studies.Recent findings:We present novel positive effects on Alzheimer's disease derived from diet, trace elements, vitamins and supplements. We discuss the inherent difficulty in conducting nutritional studies because of the variance in participants' nutritional history, versus pharmacological interventions in which participants are naive to the intervention. We examine the evidence that epigenetics play a role in Alzheimer's disease and how nutritional intervention can modify the key epigenetic events to maintain or improve cognitive performance.Summary:Overall consideration of the most recent collective evidence suggests that the optimal approach for Alzheimer's disease would seem to combine early, multicomponent nutritional approaches (a Mediterranean-style diet, multivitamins and key combinatorial supplements), along with lifestyle modifications such as social activity and mental and physical exercise, with ultimate addition of pharmacological agents when warranted.",25602242,,10.1097/YCO.0000000000000138,7
Interactions of Amyloid-β with Membrane Proteins,"In developing and developed countries, an increasing elderly population is observed. This affects the growing percentage of people struggling with neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease. Nevertheless, the pathomechanism of this disease is still unknown. This contributes to problems with early diagnosis of the disease as well as with treatment. One of the most popular hypotheses of Alzheimer's disease is related to the pathological deposition of amyloid-β (Aβ) in the brain of ill people. In this paper, we discuss issues related to Aβ and its relationship in the development of Alzheimer's disease. The structure of Aβ and its interaction with the cell membrane are discussed. Not only do the extracellular plaques affect nerve cells, but other forms of this peptide as well.",34199915,PMC8200087,10.3390/ijms22116075,13
Using Drugs as Molecular Probes: A Computational Chemical Biology Approach in Neurodegenerative Diseases,"Neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's disease are complex to tackle because of the complexity of the brain, both in structure and function. Such complexity is reflected by the involvement of various brain regions and multiple pathways in the etiology of neurodegenerative diseases that render single drug target approaches ineffective. Particularly in the area of neurodegeneration, attention has been drawn to repurposing existing drugs with proven efficacy and safety profiles. However, there is a lack of systematic analysis of the brain chemical space to predict the feasibility of repurposing strategies. Using a mechanism-based, drug-target interaction modeling approach, we have identified promising drug candidates for repositioning. Mechanistic cause-and-effect models consolidate relevant prior knowledge on drugs, targets, and pathways from the scientific literature and integrate insights derived from experimental data. We demonstrate the power of this approach by predicting two repositioning candidates for Alzheimer's disease and one for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.",28035920,PMC5271458,10.3233/JAD-160222,9
Peptidomic Approaches and Observations in Neurodegenerative Diseases,"Mass spectrometry (MS), with its immense technological developments over the last two decades, has emerged as an unavoidable technique in analyzing biomolecules such as proteins and peptides. Its multiplexing capability and explorative approach make it a valuable tool for analyzing complex clinical samples concerning biomarker research and investigating pathophysiological mechanisms. Peptides regulate various biological processes, and several of them play a critical role in many disease-related pathological conditions. One important example in neurodegenerative diseases is the accumulation of amyloid-beta peptides (Aβ) in the brain of Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients. When investigating brain function and brain-related pathologies, such as neurodegenerative diseases, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) represents the most suitable sample because of its direct contact with the brain. In this review, we evaluate publications applying peptidomics analysis to CSF samples, focusing on neurodegenerative diseases. We describe the methodology of peptidomics analysis and give an overview of the achievements of CSF peptidomics over the years. Finally, publications reporting peptides regulated in AD are discussed.",35806335,PMC9266836,10.3390/ijms23137332,3
Selected Micronutrients in Cognitive Decline Prevention and Therapy,"Population aging is a worldwide demographic trend. Consequently, the prevalence of chronic age-related conditions such as clinically diagnosed neurological diseases, cognitive decline, and dementia will significantly increase in the near future. The important role of diets and healthy lifestyle as preventative of neurodegenerative diseases is widely accepted nowadays, and it may provide preventive strategies in very early, non-symptomatic phases of dementia well, especially because there are still no effective treatments for it. In this article, we review the known effects of selected micronutrients on the aging brain and we propose strategies for dietary improvements.",26198569,,10.1007/s12035-015-9349-1,6
Nanomaterials in Alzheimer's disease treatment: a comprehensive review,"Alzheimer's, a progressive neurodegenerative disease affects brain and neurons through enormous reduction in nerve cell regenerative capacity. Dementia and impairment of cognitive functions are more prevalent in Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients in both industrialized and non-industrialized countries. Various factors play significant role in molecular cascades that leads to neuronal inflammation, dementia and thereby AD progression. Current medications are symptomatic that alleviates pain while lack in absolute cure, urging researchers to explore targets and therapeutics. Interestingly, nanomedicines developed due to the onset of nanotechnology, are being extensively investigated for the treatment of AD. This review presents the advancement in nanotherapeutic strategies, involving the emergence of nanomaterials that offers advantage to pass through the blood-brain barrier and acts as a therapeutic modality against AD.",34719210,,10.52586/4992,6
Novel Therapeutics for the Treatment of Alzheimer's and Parkinson's Disease,"Neurodegenerative diseases are a leading apprehension in underdeveloped and developed countries. The advancement of medical science is synonymous with an increase in life expectancy, which results in an aging population. Neurodegenerative diseases in the older population are on the rise globally. This review sums up the novel therapeutic approaches for Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease. Although most neurodegenerative diseases occur due to the accumulation of misfolded proteins, the mechanisms are not completely understood. Currently, only prophylactic therapies are available and none are preventive in nature. The World Health Organisation estimates that neurodegenerative diseases that cause cognitive and motor impairments will be the second most ubiquitous cause of death in the next decade, hence the need for novel therapeutic targets for these diseases is demanded. In Alzheimer's, β-amyloid and tau proteinopathies are prevalent, whereas a prion-like increase of α- synuclein is the characteristic trait of Parkinson's disease.",31914906,,10.2174/1381612826666200107161051,1
Mechanisms and structure-activity relationships of polysaccharides in the intervention of Alzheimer's disease: A review,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex neurodegenerative disease. Despite several decades of research, the development of effective treatments and responses for Alzheimer's disease remains elusive. The utilization of polysaccharides for Alzheimer's disease became more popular due to their beneficial characteristics, notably their multi-target activity and low toxicity. This review mainly focuses on the researches of recent 5 years in the regulation of AD by naturally derived polysaccharides, systematically lists the possible intervention pathways of polysaccharides from different mechanisms, and explores the structure-activity relationship between polysaccharide structural activities, so as to provide references for the intervention and treatment of AD by polysaccharides.",37865357,,10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2023.127553,0
Alzheimer's disease and gut microbiota: does trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) play a role?,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease that affects memory and cognitive function. Clinical evidence has put into question our current understanding of AD development, propelling researchers to look into further avenues. Gut microbiota has emerged as a potential player in AD pathophysiology. Lifestyle factors, such as diet, can have negative effects on the gut microbiota and thus host health. A Western-type diet has been highlighted as a risk factor for both gut microbiota alteration as well as AD development. The gut-derived trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) has been previously implied in the development of cardiovascular diseases with recent evidence suggesting a plausible role of TMAO in AD development. Therefore, the main goal of the present review is to provide the reader with potential mechanisms of action through which consumption of a Western-type diet could increase AD risk, by acting through microbiota-produced TMAO. Although a link between TMAO and AD is far from definitive, this review will serve as a call for research into this new area of research.",33942080,,10.1093/nutrit/nuab022,22
Aβ propagation and strains: Implications for the phenotypic diversity in Alzheimer's disease,"The progressive nature of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is thought to occur, at least in part, by the self-replication and spreading of Aβ and Tau aggregates through a prion mechanism. Evidence now exists that structural variants of Aβ prions can propagate their distinct conformations through template-directed folding of naïve Aβ peptides. This notion implicates that the first self-propagating Aβ assembly to emerge in the brain dictates the conformation, anatomical spread and pace of subsequently formed deposits. It is hypothesized that a prion mechanism defines the molecular basis underlying the diverse clinicopathologic phenotypes observed across the spectrum of AD patients. Thus, distinct AD strains might require further sub-classification based on biochemical and structural characterization of aggregated Aβ. Here, we review the evidence for distinct, self-propagating Aβ strains, and discuss potential cellular mechanisms that might contribute to their manifestation. From this perspective, we also explore the implications of Aβ strains for current FDA-approved medical imaging probes and therapies for amyloid. Ultimately, the discovery of new molecular tools to differentiate Aβ strains and dissect the heterogeneity of AD may lead to the development of more informative diagnostics and strain-specific therapeutics.",28359847,,10.1016/j.nbd.2017.03.014,42
The Influence of the Gut Microbiota on Alzheimer's Disease: A Narrative Review,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a common neurodegenerative disease that tends to occur in the elderly. The main symptom is hypomnesia. More and more older people are suffering from this disease worldwide. By 2050, 152 million people worldwide are expected to have AD. It is thought that the aggregation of amyloid-beta peptides and hyper-phosphorylated tau tangles contribute to AD. The microbiota-gut-brain (MGB) axis appears as a new concept. The MGB axis is a collection of microbial molecules produced in the gastrointestinal tract that influence the physiological function of the brain. In this review, we discuss how the gut microbiota (GM) and its metabolites affect AD in different ways. Dysregulation of the GM has been shown to be involved in various mechanisms involved in memory and learning functions. We review the current literature on the role of the entero-brain axis in the pathogenesis of AD and its potential role as a future therapeutic target in the treatment and/or prevention of AD.",36992601,,10.31083/j.jin2202038,4
Descriptive Epidemiology of Neurodegenerative Diseases: What Are the Critical Questions?,"The field of neurodegenerative diseases is a major challenge faced by public health and is still in need of robust preventive measures and disease-modifying treatments. Population-based studies can offer the framework in the context of primary and secondary prevention of neurodegenerative diseases. The epidemiology of neurodegenerative disorders in the last decades has focused on descriptive studies mainly based on the use of clinical criteria. However, clinical definition is basically insufficient both to well-characterize different phenotypes and to make an early diagnosis. Descriptive epidemiology needs a new framework to update the area of neurodegenerative research, based on the advancement of both clinical and biological diagnostic criteria and the urgency for an early diagnosis of the disease. In here, we address the present and future of population-based studies in neurodegenerative disorders and discuss the shift of paradigms in the diagnosis of disease and disease definition. We further debate the changes in biomarker implementation models and type of biomarkers used in population-based studies. Descriptive epidemiology of neurodegenerative disorders is rapidly evolving. These implementations will improve the future design and outcome of population-based studies and policy-making in public health intervention.",35728570,PMC9677839,10.1159/000525639,7
Polygenic score for Alzheimer's disease identifies differential atrophy in hippocampal subfield volumes,"Hippocampal subfield atrophy is a prime structural change in the brain, associated with cognitive aging and neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease. Recent developments in genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified genetic loci that characterize the risk of hippocampal volume loss based on the processes of normal and abnormal aging. Polygenic risk scores are the genetic proxies mimicking the genetic role of the pre-existing vulnerabilities of the underlying mechanisms influencing these changes. Discriminating the genetic predispositions of hippocampal subfield atrophy between cognitive aging and neurodegenerative diseases will be helpful in understanding the disease etiology. In this study, we evaluated the polygenic risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD PGRS) for hippocampal subfield atrophy in 1,086 individuals (319 cognitively normal (CN), 591 mild cognitively impaired (MCI), and 176 Alzheimer's disease dementia (ADD)). Our results showed a stronger association of AD PGRS effect on the left hemisphere than on the right hemisphere for all the hippocampal subfield volumes in a mixed clinical population (CN+MCI+ADD). The subfields CA1, CA4, hippocampal tail, subiculum, presubiculum, molecular layer, GC-ML-DG, and HATA showed stronger AD PGRS associations with the MCI+ADD group than with the CN group. The subfields CA3, parasubiculum, and fimbria showed moderately higher AD PGRS associations with the MCI+ADD group than with the CN group. Our findings suggest that the eight subfield regions, which were strongly associated with AD PGRS are likely involved in the early stage ADD and a specific focus on the left hemisphere could enhance the early prediction of ADD.",35830443,PMC9278752,10.1371/journal.pone.0270795,0
ASK1 in neurodegeneration,"Neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs) such as glaucoma, multiple sclerosis (MS), Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and Huntington's disease (HD) are characterized by the progressive loss of neurons, causing irreversible damage to patients. Longer lifespans may be leading to an increase in the number of people affected by NDDs worldwide. Among the pathways strongly impacting the pathogenesis of NDDs, oxidative stress, a condition that occurs because of an imbalance in oxidant and antioxidant levels, has been known to play a vital role in the pathophysiology of NDDs. One of the molecules activated by oxidative stress is apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1), which has been shown to play a role in NDDs. ASK1 activation is regulated by multiple steps, including oligomerization, phosphorylation, and protein-protein interactions. In the oxidative stress state, reactive oxygen species (ROS) induce the dissociation of thioredoxin, a protein regulating cellular reduction and oxidation (redox), from the N-terminal region of ASK1, and ASK1 is subsequently activated by the oligomerization and phosphorylation of a critical threonine residue, leading to cell death. Here, we review experimental evidence that links ASK1 signaling with the pathogenesis of several NDDs. We propose that ASK1 may be a new point of therapeutic intervention to prevent or treat NDDs.",28882588,,10.1016/j.jbior.2017.08.003,25
"Pathology of the Aging Brain in Domestic and Laboratory Animals, and Animal Models of Human Neurodegenerative Diseases","According to the WHO, the proportion of people over 60 years is increasing and expected to reach 22% of total world's population in 2050. In parallel, recent animal demographic studies have shown that the life expectancy of pet dogs and cats is increasing. Brain aging is associated not only with molecular and morphological changes but also leads to different degrees of behavioral and cognitive dysfunction. Common age-related brain lesions in humans include brain atrophy, neuronal loss, amyloid plaques, cerebrovascular amyloid angiopathy, vascular mineralization, neurofibrillary tangles, meningeal osseous metaplasia, and accumulation of lipofuscin. In aging humans, the most common neurodegenerative disorder is Alzheimer's disease (AD), which progressively impairs cognition, behavior, and quality of life. Pathologic changes comparable to the lesions of AD are described in several other animal species, although their clinical significance and effect on cognitive function are poorly documented. This review describes the commonly reported age-associated neurologic lesions in domestic and laboratory animals and the relationship of these lesions to cognitive dysfunction. Also described are the comparative interspecies similarities and differences to AD and other human neurodegenerative diseases including Parkinson's disease and progressive supranuclear palsy, and the spontaneous and transgenic animal models of these diseases.",26869150,,10.1177/0300985815623997,47
Spatial Relationships between Molecular Pathology and Neurodegeneration in the Alzheimer's Disease Continuum,"A deeper understanding of the spatial relationships of β-amyloid (Aβ), tau, and neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's disease (AD) could provide insight into pathogenesis and clinical trial design. We included 81 amyloid-positive patients (age 64.4 ± 9.5) diagnosed with AD dementia or mild cognitive impairment due to AD and available 11C-PiB (PIB), 18F-Flortaucipir (FTP),18F-FDG-PET, and 3T-MRI, and 31 amyloid-positive, cognitively normal participants (age 77.3 ± 6.5, no FDG-PET). W-score voxel-wise deviation maps were created and binarized for each imaging-modality (W > 1.64, P < 0.05) adjusting for age, sex, and total intracranial volume (sMRI-only) using amyloid-negative cognitively normal adults. For symptomatic patients, FDG-PET and atrophy W-maps were combined into neurodegeneration maps (ND). Aβ-pathology showed the greatest proportion of cortical gray matter suprathreshold voxels (spatial extent) for both symptomatic and asymptomatic participants (median 94-55%, respectively), followed by tau (79-11%) and neurodegeneration (41-3%). Amyloid > tau > neurodegeneration was the most frequent hierarchy for both groups (79-77%, respectively), followed by tau > amyloid > neurodegeneration (13-10%) and amyloid > neurodegeneration > tau (6-13%). For symptomatic participants, most abnormal voxels were PIB+/FTP+/ND- (median 35%), and the great majority of ND+ voxels (91%) colocalized with molecular pathology. Amyloid spatially exceeded tau and neurodegeneration, with individual heterogeneities. Molecular pathology and neurodegeneration showed a progressive overlap along AD course, indicating shared vulnerabilities or synergistic toxic mechanisms.",32808011,PMC7727356,10.1093/cercor/bhaa184,18
The role of the immune system in neurodegenerative disorders: Adaptive or maladaptive?,"Neurodegenerative diseases share common features, including catastrophic neuronal loss that leads to cognitive or motor dysfunction. Neuronal injury occurs in an inflammatory milieu that is populated by resident and sometimes, infiltrating, immune cells - all of which participate in a complex interplay between secreted inflammatory modulators and activated immune cell surface receptors. The importance of these immunomodulators is highlighted by the number of immune factors that have been associated with increased risk of neurodegeneration in recent genome-wide association studies. One of the more difficult tasks for designing therapeutic strategies for immune modulation against neurodegenerative diseases is teasing apart beneficial from harmful signals. In this regard, learning more about the immune components of these diseases has yielded common themes. These unifying concepts should eventually enable immune-based therapeutics for treatment of Alzheimer׳s and Parkinson׳s diseases and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Targeted immune modulation should be possible to temper maladaptive factors, enabling beneficial immune responses in the context of neurodegenerative diseases. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled SI: Neuroimmunology in Health And Disease.",25218556,PMC4362937,10.1016/j.brainres.2014.09.008,43
"Exploring depression in Alzheimer's disease: an Italian Delphi Consensus on phenomenology, diagnosis, and management","Background:In Alzheimer's disease (AD), the progressive cognitive impairment is often combined with a variety of neuropsychiatric symptoms, firstly depression. Nevertheless, its diagnosis and management is difficult, since specific diagnostic criteria and guidelines for treatment are still lacking. The aim of this Delphi study is to reach a shared point of view among different Italian specialists on depression in AD.Methods:An online Delphi survey with 30 questions regarding epidemiology, diagnosis, clinical features, and treatment of depression in AD was administered anonymously to a panel of 53 expert clinicians.Results:Consensus was achieved in most cases (86%). In the 80% of statements, a positive consensus was reached, while in 6% a negative consensus was achieved. No consensus was obtained in 14%. Among the most relevant findings, the link between depression and AD is believed to be strong and concerns etiopathogenesis and phenomenology. Further, depression in AD seems to have specific features compared to major depressive disorder (MDD). Regarding diagnosis, the DSM 5 diagnostic criteria for MDD seems to be not able to detect the specific aspects of depression in AD. Concerning treatment, antidepressant drugs are generally considered the main option for depression in dementia, according to previous guidelines. In order to limit side effects, multimodal and SSRI antidepressant are preferred by clinicians. In particular, the procognitive effect of vortioxetine seems to be appealing for the treatment of depression in AD.Conclusions:This study highlights some crucial aspects of depression in AD, but more investigations and specific recommendations are needed.",37402937,PMC10641046,10.1007/s10072-023-06891-w,2
Gallic acid oxidation products alter the formation pathway of insulin amyloid fibrils,"Amyloidogenic protein assembly into insoluble fibrillar aggregates is linked with several neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer's or Parkinson's disease, affecting millions of people worldwide. The search for a potential anti-amyloid drug has led to the discovery of hundreds of compounds, none of which have passed all clinical trials. Gallic acid has been shown to both modulate factors leading to the onset of neurodegenerative disorders, as well as directly inhibit amyloid formation. However, the conditions under which this effect is seen could lead to oxidation of this polyphenol, likely changing its properties. Here we examine the effect of gallic acid and its oxidised form on the aggregation of a model amyloidogenic protein-insulin at low pH conditions. We show a vastly higher inhibitory potential of the oxidised form, as well as an alteration in the aggregation pathway, leading to the formation of a specific fibril conformation.",32879381,PMC7468289,10.1038/s41598-020-70982-3,5
[Research Progress of CD4+T Cells-mediated Regulation of Neuroinflammation Involved in Neurodegenerative Diseases],"Neurodegenerative diseases are associated with neuroinflammation,oxidative stress,and aging,which can lead to cognitive and motor dysfunctions.Recent studies suggest that the development of neurodegenerative diseases is related to adaptive immunity,in which CD4+T cells are involved as adaptive immune cells.Through different pathways,CD4+T cells differentiate into effector and regulatory subsets,which may have different effects on the progression of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease,Parkinson's disease,multiple sclerosis,and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.Here,we review the role and research progress of CD4+T cells in neurodegenerative diseases.",34494536,,10.3881/j.issn.1000-503X.13146,1
Correlation of metal ions with specific brain region volumes in neurodegenerative diseases,"Background/aim:There are reports stating that deteriorations in metal homeostasis in neurodegenerative diseases promote abnormal protein accumulation. In this study, the serum metal levels in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD) and its relationship with the cortical regions of the brain were investigated.Materials and methods:The patients were divided into 3 groups consisting of the AD group, PD group, and healthy control group (n = 15 for each). The volumes of specific brain regions were measured over the participants' 3-dimensional magnetic resonance images, and they were compared across the groups. Copper, zinc, iron, and ferritin levels in the serums were determined, and their correlations with the brain region volumes were examined.Results:The volumes of left hippocampus and right substantia nigra were lower in the AD and PD groups, while the volume of the left nucleus caudatus (CdN) and bilateral insula were lower in the AD group compared to the control group. Serum zinc levels were lower in the AD and PD groups, while the iron level was lower in the PD group in comparison to the control group. In addition, the serum ferritin level was higher in the AD group than in the control group. Serum zinc and copper levels in the AD group were positively correlated with the volumes of the right entorhinal cortex, thalamus, CdN, and insula. Serum zinc and copper levels in the PD group showed a negative correlation with the left nucleus accumbens (NAc), right putamen, and right insula volumes. While the serum ferritin level in the PD group displayed a positive correlation with the bilateral CdN, putamen, and NAc, as well as the right hippocampus and insula volumes, no area was detected that showed a correlation with the serum ferritin level in the AD group.Conclusion:A relationship was determined between the serum metal levels in the AD and PD groups and certain brain cortical regions that showed volumetric changes, which can be important for the early diagnosis of neurodegenerative diseases.",38812995,PMC10763799,10.55730/1300-0144.5714,0
Neurodegenerative diseases and therapeutic strategies using iron chelators,"This review will summarise the current state of our knowledge concerning the involvement of iron in various neurological diseases and the potential of therapy with iron chelators to retard the progression of the disease. We first discuss briefly the role of metal ions in brain function before outlining the way by which transition metal ions, such as iron and copper, can initiate neurodegeneration through the generation of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species. This results in protein misfolding, amyloid production and formation of insoluble protein aggregates which are contained within inclusion bodies. This will activate microglia leading to neuroinflammation. Neuroinflammation plays an important role in the progression of the neurodegenerative diseases, with activated microglia releasing pro-inflammatory cytokines leading to cellular cell loss. The evidence for metal involvement in Parkinson's and Alzheimer's disease as well as Friedreich's ataxia and multiple sclerosis will be presented. Preliminary results from trials of iron chelation therapy in these neurodegenerative diseases will be reviewed.",25716300,,10.1016/j.jtemb.2014.12.012,39
Noradrenergic pathways of locus coeruleus in Parkinson's and Alzheimer's pathology,Noradrenergic system of brain supplies the neurotransmitter noradrenalin throughout the brain through widespread efferent projections and play pivotal role in cognitive activities and could be involve in motor and non-motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD) pathology. Profound loss of noradrenergic pathways has been reported in both Parkinson's and Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology however their employment in therapeutics is still scarce. Therefore the present review is providing the various aspects for involvement on noradrenergic pathways in PD and AD pathology as well as the imaging of locus coeruleus as indicative diagnostic marker for disease. The present review is describing about the role of tiny nucleus locus coeruleus located noradrenergic pathways in said pathologies and discussing the past research as well as lacunas in this regard.,31575316,,10.1080/00207454.2019.1667799,6
Proteomic-Based Studies on Memory Formation in Normal and Neurodegenerative Disease-Affected Brains,"A critical aspect of cognition is the ability to acquire, consolidate, and evoke memories, which is considerably impaired by neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. These mnemonic processes are dependent on signaling cascades, which involve protein expression and degradation. Recent mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomics has opened a range of possibilities for the study of memory formation and impairment, making it possible to research protein systems not studied before. However, in the context of synaptic proteome related to learning processes and memory formation, a deeper understanding of the synaptic proteome temporal dynamics after induction of synaptic plasticity and the molecular changes underlying the cognitive deficits seen in neurodegenerative diseases is needed. This review analyzes the applications of proteomics for understanding memory processes in both normal and neurodegenerative conditions. Moreover, the most critical experimental studies have been summarized using the PANTHER overrepresentation test. Finally, limitations associated with investigations of memory studies in physiological and neurodegenerative disorders have also been discussed.",38409419,,10.1007/978-3-031-50624-6_7,0
"The ""when"" matters: Evidence from memory markers in the clinical continuum of Alzheimer's disease","Objective:Cognitive assessment able to detect impairments in the early neuropathological stages of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is urgently needed. The visual short-term memory binding task (VSTMBT) and the Free and Cued Selective Reminding Test (FCSRT) have been recommended by the neurodegenerative disease working group as promising tests to aid in the early detection of AD. In this study, we investigated their complementary value across the clinical stages of the AD continuum.Method:One hundred and seventeen older adults with subjective cognitive complaint (SCC), 79 with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), 31 patients with AD dementia (ADD), and 37 cognitively unimpaired (CU) subjects, underwent assessment with the VSTMBT and the picture version of the Spanish FCSRT.Results:After controlling for multiple comparisons, significant differences were found across groups. The VSTMBT was the only test that ""marginally"" differentiated between CU and SCC (d= 0.47,p= .052). Moreover, whereas the FCSRT showed a gradient (CU = SCC) > MCI > ADD, the VSTMBT gradient was CU > SCC > (MCI = ADD) suggesting that conjunctive binding deficits assessed by the latter may be sensitive to the very early stages of the disease.Conclusions:Our results suggest that the VSTMBT and the FCSRT are sensitive to the clinical continuum of AD. Whereas the former detects changes in the early prodromal stages, the latter is more sensitive to the advanced prodromal stages of AD. These novel tests can aid in the early detection, monitor disease progression and response to treatment, and thus support drug development programs.

Transthyretin Stabilization: An Emerging Strategy for the Treatment of Alzheimer's Disease?,"Transthyretin (TTR), previously named prealbumin is a plasma protein secreted mainly by the liver and choroid plexus (CP) that is a carrier for thyroid hormones (THs) and retinol (vitamin A). The structure of TTR, with four monomers rich in β-chains in a globular tetrameric protein, accounts for the predisposition of the protein to aggregate in fibrils, leading to a rare and severe disease, namely transthyretin amyloidosis (ATTR). Much effort has been made and still is required to find new therapeutic compounds that can stabilize TTR (""kinetic stabilization"") and prevent the amyloid genetic process. Moreover, TTR is an interesting therapeutic target for neurodegenerative diseases due to its recognized neuroprotective properties in the cognitive impairment context and interestingly in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Much evidence has been collected regarding the neuroprotective effects in AD, including through in vitro and in vivo studies as well as a wide range of clinical series. Despite this supported hypothesis of neuroprotection for TTR, the mechanisms are still not completely clear. The aim of this review is to highlight the most relevant findings on the neuroprotective role of TTR, and to summarize the recent progress on the development of TTR tetramer stabilizers.",33212973,PMC7698513,10.3390/ijms21228672,10
"Differential expression of microRNAs in Alzheimer's disease brain, blood, and cerebrospinal fluid","Introduction:Several microRNAs (miRNAs) have been implicated in Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis, but the evidence from individual case-control studies remains inconclusive.Methods:A systematic literature review was performed, followed by standardized multistage data extraction, quality control, and meta-analyses on eligible data for brain, blood, and cerebrospinal fluid specimens. Results were compared with miRNAs reported in the abstracts of eligible studies or recent qualitative reviews to assess novelty.Results:Data from 147 independent data sets across 107 publications were quantitatively assessed in 461 meta-analyses. Twenty-five, five, and 32 miRNAs showed studywide significant differential expression (α < 1·08 × 10-4) in brain, cerebrospinal fluid, and blood-derived specimens, respectively, with 5 miRNAs showing differential expression in both brain and blood. Of these 57 miRNAs, 13 had not been reported in the abstracts of previous original or review articles.Discussion:Our systematic assessment of differential miRNA expression is the first of its kind in Alzheimer's disease and highlights several miRNAs of potential relevance.",31495604,,10.1016/j.jalz.2019.06.4952,61
Neuroimaging in dementia. Clinical-radiological correlation,"Dementia is a syndrome characterised by chronic, multi-domain, acquired cognitive impairment that causes significant functional limitations. MRI is the standard imaging study for these cases, since it enables detection of the atrophy patterns of the various neurodegenerative diseases (Alzheimer's disease, frontotemporal degeneration, Lewy body dementia), the vascular lesions associated with vascular dementia, and various potentially reversible diseases (for example, tumours, hydrocephaly) or diseases that require special management measures (for example, prion diseases). In certain cases other imaging methods can be used, such as CT, functional MRI, HMPAO SPECT or dopaminergic markers and FDG PET, amyloid markers or dopaminergic markers. The indications for these methods have not yet been clearly established, and therefore should be used in multidisciplinary dementia units.",30482502,,10.1016/j.rx.2018.08.004,3
Exploring the dual character of metformin in Alzheimer's disease,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disease, which results in dementia typically in the elderly. The disease is mainly characterized by the deposition of amyloid beta (Aβ) plaques and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) in the brain. However, only few drugs are available for AD because of its unknown pathological mechanism which limits the development of new drugs. Therefore, it is urgent to identify potential therapeutic strategies for AD. Moreover, research have showed that there is a significant association between Type 2 diabetes mellites (T2DM) and AD, suggesting that the two diseases may share common pathophysiological mechanisms. Such mechanisms include impaired insulin signaling, altered glucose metabolism, inflammation, oxidative stress, and premature aging, which strongly affect cognitive function and increased risk of dementia. Consequently, as a widely used drug for T2DM, metformin also has therapeutic potential for AD in vivo. It has been confirmed that metformin is beneficial on the brain of AD animal models. The mechanisms underlying the effects of metformin in Alzheimer's disease are complex and multifaceted. Metformin may work through mechanisms involving homeostasis of glucose metabolism, decrease of amyloid plaque deposition, normalization of tau protein phosphorylation and enhancement of autophagy. However, in clinical trials, metformin had little effects on patients with mild cognitive impairment or mild AD. Pathological effects and negative clinical results of metformin on AD make the current topic quite controversial. By reviewing the latest progress of related research, this paper summarizes the possible role of metformin in AD. The purpose of this study is not only to determine the potential treatment of AD, but also other related neurodegenerative diseases.",35077762,,10.1016/j.neuropharm.2022.108966,7
Advances and considerations in AD tau-targeted immunotherapy,"The multifactorial and complex nature of Alzheimer's disease (AD) has made it difficult to identify therapeutic targets that are causally involved in the disease process. However, accumulating evidence from experimental and clinical studies that investigate the early disease process point towards the required role of tau in AD etiology. Importantly, a large number of studies investigate and characterize the plethora of pathological forms of tau protein involved in disease onset and propagation. Immunotherapy is one of the most clinical approaches anticipated to make a difference in the field of AD therapeutics. Tau -targeted immunotherapy is the new direction after the failure of amyloid beta (Aß)-targeted immunotherapy and the growing number of studies that highlight the Aß-independent disease process. It is now well established that immunotherapy alone will most likely be insufficient as a monotherapy. Therefore, this review discusses updates on tau-targeted immunotherapy studies, AD-relevant tau species, updates on promising biomarkers and a prospect on combination therapies to surround the disease propagation in an efficient and timely manner.",31841678,PMC6980703,10.1016/j.nbd.2019.104707,37
Circulating microRNAs as novel biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disorder. Biomarkers could help identify patients at risk and define stages of this disease. Furthermore, biomarkers can be used to evaluate the efficiency of therapeutic agents under testing and thus accelerate the therapeutic discovery process. Biological exploration of AD is currently based on the measurement of β amyloid peptides, tau and phospho-Tau proteins in cerebrospinal fluid. However, these tests have many limitations. So, the search for new biomarkers is very active. The ability of microRNAs (miRNAs) to regulate neuronal processes by acting as molecular switches in combination with their region specificity make that researchers are interested in miRNAs for their potential uses as biomarkers and as a treatment for neurodegenerative diseases including AD. This literature review aims to take stock of the use of circulating miRNAs as a novel biomarkers for AD.",29800558,,10.1016/j.cca.2018.05.039,13
Potential of GPCRs to modulate MAPK and mTOR pathways in Alzheimer's disease,"Despite efforts to understand the mechanism of neuronal cell death, finding effective therapies for neurodegenerative diseases is still a challenge. Cognitive deficits are often associated with neurodegenerative diseases. Remarkably, in the absence of consensus biomarkers, diagnosis of diseases such as Alzheimer's still relies on cognitive tests. Unfortunately, all efforts to translate findings in animal models to the patients have been unsuccessful. Alzheimer's disease may be addressed from two different points of view, neuroprotection or cognitive enhancement. Based on recent data, the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway arises as a versatile player whose modulation may impact on mechanisms of both neuroprotection and cognition. Whereas direct targeting of mTOR does not seem to constitute a convenient approach in drug discovery, its indirect modulation by other signaling pathways seems promising. In fact, G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) remain the most common 'druggable' targets and as such pharmacological manipulation of GPCRs with selective ligands may modulate phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase (PI3K), mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase and mTOR signaling pathways. Thus, GPCRs become important targets for potential drug treatments in different neurodegenerative disorders including, but not limited to, Alzheimer's disease. GPCR-mediated modulation of mTOR may take advantage of different GPCRs coupled to different G-dependent and G-independent signal transduction routes, of functional selectivity and/or of biased agonism. Signals mediated by GPCRs may act as coincidence detectors to achieve different benefits in different stages of the neurodegenerative disease.",28189739,,10.1016/j.pneurobio.2017.01.004,21
[Signaling molecules in the brain and epigenetic factors in neurodegenerative and mental disorders],"The literature on a role of signaling molecules in the organization of memory and cognitive functions is analyzed basing on mechanisms of memory physiology determined by a complex of biochemical processes initiated by the transmission of the signal to the synapse and completed by the synthesis of functionally significant molecules in the neuronal genetic apparatus. The center of these processes is a coordinated system of signal transduction, transcription, epigenetic and neurotrophic molecules. The dissonance of signal mechanisms is a prime cause of memory impairment and cognitive dysfunction as social maladaptation factors. The results of experimental and clinical studies of a role of the multilevel signaling system in age-related, neurodegenerative (Alzheimer’s disease) and mental (depression) disorders are discussed. At the same time, signaling molecules may be considered as particular targets for new therapeutic approaches.",26649375,,10.17116/jnevro2015115101102-110,0
"Biomarkers used in Alzheimer's disease diagnosis, treatment, and prevention","Alzheimer's disease (AD), being the number one in terms of dementia burden, is an insidious age-related neurodegenerative disease and is presently considered a global public health threat. Its main histological hallmarks are the Aβ senile plaques and the P-tau neurofibrillary tangles, while clinically it is marked by a progressive cognitive decline that reflects the underlying synaptic loss and neurodegeneration. Many of the drug therapies targeting the two pathological hallmarks namely Aβ and P-tau have been proven futile. This is probably attributed to the initiation of therapy at a stage where cognitive alterations are already obvious. In other words, the underlying neuropathological changes are at a stage where these drugs lack any therapeutic value in reversing the damage. Therefore, there is an urgent need to start treatment in the very early stage where these changes can be reversed, and hence, early diagnosis is of primordial importance. To this aim, the use of robust and informative biomarkers that could provide accurate diagnosis preferably at an earlier phase of the disease is of the essence. To date, several biomarkers have been established that, to a different extent, allow researchers and clinicians to evaluate, diagnose, and more specially exclude other related pathologies. In this study, we extensively reviewed data on the currently explored biomarkers in terms of AD pathology-specific and non-specific biomarkers and highlighted the recent developments in the diagnostic and theragnostic domains. In the end, we have presented a separate elaboration on aspects of future perspectives and concluding remarks.",34933129,,10.1016/j.arr.2021.101544,34
An Introduction to Ultrasensitive Assays for Plasma Tau Detection,"The detection of plasma tau and its phosphorylation is technically challenging due to the relatively low sensitivity. However, in Alzheimer's disease and other tauopathies, it is hypothesized that tau in the biofluid may serve as a biomarker. In recent years, several ultrasensitive assays have been developed, which can successfully detect tau and its phosphorylation in various biofluids, and collectively demonstrated the prognostic and diagnostic value of plasma tau/phosphorylated tau. Here we have summarized the principle of four ultrasensitive assays newly developed suitable for plasma tau detection, namely single-molecule array, immunomagnetic reduction assay, enhanced immunoassay using multi-arrayed fiber optics, and meso scale discovery assay, with their advantages and applications. We have also compared these assays with traditional enzyme-linked-immunosorbent serologic assay, hoping to facilitate future tau-based biomarker discovery for Alzheimer's disease and other neurodegenerative diseases.",33682718,,10.3233/JAD-201499,4
"Lithium, a Therapy for AD: Current Evidence from Clinical Trials of Neurodegenerative Disorders","Background:Preclinical studies have shown that lithium modifies pathological cascades implicated in certain neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), Huntigton`s disease (HD), multiple system atrophy (MSA) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). A critical question is whether these pharmacodynamic properties of lithium translate into neurodegenerative diseases modifying effects in human subjects.Methods:We reviewed all English controlled clinical trials published in PubMed, PsycINFO, Embase, SCOPUS, ISI-Web with the use of lithium for the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders between July 2004 and July 2014.Results:Lithium showed evidence for positive effects on cognitive functions and biomarkers in amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI, 1 study) and AD (2 studies), even with doses lower than those used for mood stabilisation. Studies of Li in HD, MSA and CSI did not show benefits of lithium. However, due to methodological limitations and small sample size, these studies may be inconclusive. Studies in ALS showed consistently negative results and presented evidence against the use of lithium for the treatment of this disease.Conclusion:In absence of disease modifying treatments for any neurodegenerative disorders, the fact that at least 3 studies supported the effect of lithium in aMCI/AD is noteworthy. Future studies should focus on defining the dose range necessary for neuroprotective effects to occur.",26892289,,10.2174/1567205013666160219112854,19
Prions and Neurodegenerative Diseases: A Focus on Alzheimer's Disease,"Specific protein misfolding and aggregation are mechanisms underlying various neurodegenerative diseases such as prion disease and Alzheimer's disease (AD). The misfolded proteins are involved in prions, amyloid-β (Aβ), tau, and α-synuclein disorders; they share common structural, biological, and biochemical characteristics, as well as similar mechanisms of aggregation and self-propagation. Pathological features of AD include the appearance of plaques consisting of deposition of protein Aβ and neurofibrillary tangles formed by the hyperphosphorylated tau protein. Although it is not clear how protein aggregation leads to AD, we are learning that the cellular prion protein (PrPC) plays an important role in the pathogenesis of AD. Herein, we first examined the pathogenesis of prion and AD with a focus on the contribution of PrPC to the development of AD. We analyzed the mechanisms that lead to the formation of a high affinity bond between Aβ oligomers (AβOs) and PrPC. Also, we studied the role of PrPC as an AβO receptor that initiates an AβO-induced signal cascade involving mGluR5, Fyn, Pyk2, and eEF2K linking Aβ and tau pathologies, resulting in the death of neurons in the central nervous system. Finally, we have described how the PrPC-AβOs interaction can be used as a new potential therapeutic target for the treatment of PrPC-dependent AD.",34864675,,10.3233/JAD-215171,10
Blood-derived integration-free iPS cell line UKBi011-A from a diagnosed male Alzheimer's disease patient with APOE ɛ4/ɛ4 genotype,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is most the frequent neurodegenerative disease, and the APOE ε4 allele is the most prominent risk factor for late-onset AD. Here, we present an iPSC line generated from peripheral blood cells of a male AD patient employing Sendai virus vectors encoding the transcription factors OCT4, SOX2, KLF4 and c-MYC. The characterized iPSC line expresses typical human pluripotency markers and shows differentiation into all three germ layers, complete reprogramming vector clearance, a normal SNP genotype and maintenance of the APOE ε4/ε4 allele.",29753274,,10.1016/j.scr.2018.04.011,3
New Insights into Molecular Mechanisms Underlying Neurodegenerative Disorders,"As a large and heterogeneous group of disorders, neurodegenerative diseases are characterized by the progressive loss of structure or function in neurons, finally leading to neuronal death. Neurodegenerative diseases cause serious threat to a patient's quality of life and the most common are Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. Currently, little is known of the detailed etiology of these disorders; as such, there are no effective treatments available. Furthermore, the lack of targeted, effective, and resolvable therapy for neurodegenerative diseases, represents an expanding research field for the discovery of new therapeutic strategies. Investigations of the potential pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases will become the basis of preventing the occurrence and development of neurodegenerative diseases and finding effective therapies. Existing theories and mechanisms, such as genetic and environmental factors, abnormal protein accumulation, and oxidative stress, are intricately associated with each other. However, there is no molecular theory that can entirely explain the pathological processes underlying neurodegenerative diseases. Due to the development of experimental technology and the support of multidisciplinary integration, it has been possible to perform more in-depth research on potential targets for neurodegenerative diseases and there have been many exciting discoveries in terms of original theories and underlying mechanisms. With this review, we intend to review the existing literature and provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying neurodegenerative diseases.",37258447,,10.31083/j.jin2203058,3
"Disentangling the genetic overlap and causal relationships between primary open-angle glaucoma, brain morphology and four major neurodegenerative disorders","Background:Primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) is an optic neuropathy characterized by progressive degeneration of the optic nerve that leads to irreversible visual impairment. Multiple epidemiological studies suggest an association between POAG and major neurodegenerative disorders (Alzheimer's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, frontotemporal dementia, and Parkinson's disease). However, the nature of the overlap between neurodegenerative disorders, brain morphology and glaucoma remains inconclusive.Method:In this study, we performed a comprehensive assessment of the genetic and causal relationship between POAG and neurodegenerative disorders, leveraging genome-wide association data from studies of magnetic resonance imaging of the brain, POAG, and four major neurodegenerative disorders.Findings:This study found a genetic overlap and causal relationship between POAG and its related phenotypes (i.e., intraocular pressure and optic nerve morphology traits) and brain morphology in 19 regions. We also identified 11 loci with a significant local genetic correlation and a high probability of sharing the same causal variant between neurodegenerative disorders and POAG or its related phenotypes. Of interest, a region on chromosome 17 corresponding to MAPT, a well-known risk locus for Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease, was shared between POAG, optic nerve degeneration traits, and Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. Despite these local genetic overlaps, we did not identify strong evidence of a causal association between these neurodegenerative disorders and glaucoma.Interpretation:Our findings indicate a distinctive and likely independent neurodegenerative process for POAG involving several brain regions although several POAG or optic nerve degeneration risk loci are shared with neurodegenerative disorders, consistent with a pleiotropic effect rather than a causal relationship between these traits.Funding:PG was supported by an NHMRC Investigator Grant (#1173390), SM by an NHMRC Senior Research Fellowship and an NHMRC Program Grant (APP1150144), DM by an NHMRC Fellowship, LP is funded by the NEIEY015473 and EY032559 grants, SS is supported by an NIH-Oxford Cambridge Fellowship and NIH T32 grant (GM136577), APK is supported by a UK Research and Innovation Future Leaders Fellowship, an Alcon Research Institute Young Investigator Award and a Lister Institute for Preventive Medicine Award.",37201334,PMC10206164,10.1016/j.ebiom.2023.104615,2
"Glutaminyl cyclases, the potential targets of cancer and neurodegenerative diseases","Glutaminyl cyclases (QC) catalyze the cyclization of proteins and turn N-terminal glutamine or glutamic acid into N-terminal pyroglutamate, resulting in protection of proteins from aminopeptidases and an increase of their stabilities. The aberrant N-terminal pyroglutamate has been found in various diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), Huntington's disease (HD) and cancer. Two kinds of human QC, the secretory sQC and the Golgi resident gQC, are identified to date. Several substrates of sQC involving beta amyloid (Aβ), Huntington (HTT) protein and certain inflammatory mediators such as CCL2 and CX3CL1 have been observed to associate with neurodegenerative diseases and cancers. The Golgi resident gQC can modify N-terminus of CD47 that directly influences the interaction of CD47 and SIRPα resulting in the modulations of the immunological surveillance related mechanisms in cancer. Additionally, inflammatory chemokines CCL2 and CX3CL1 can also be modified by gQC. Several QC inhibitors with differential scaffold structures have been developed and investigated. Among these QC inhibitors, PQ912, a benzimidazole-based inhibitor, has been studied in a phase II clinical trial to treat AD. In this review, we will summarize the current knowledge about QCs' tissue expression patterns, their potential cellular substrates in the context of cancers, AD and HD. After introducing QCs' molecular structures and catalysis mechanisms, the structures and efficacies of the currently reported QCs' inhibitors will also be summarized.",35948163,,10.1016/j.ejphar.2022.175178,2
"Unraveling the Genetic Landscape of Neurological Disorders: Insights into Pathogenesis, Techniques for Variant Identification, and Therapeutic Approaches","Genetic abnormalities play a crucial role in the development of neurodegenerative disorders (NDDs). Genetic exploration has indeed contributed to unraveling the molecular complexities responsible for the etiology and progression of various NDDs. The intricate nature of rare and common variants in NDDs contributes to a limited understanding of the genetic risk factors associated with them. Advancements in next-generation sequencing have made whole-genome sequencing and whole-exome sequencing possible, allowing the identification of rare variants with substantial effects, and improving the understanding of both Mendelian and complex neurological conditions. The resurgence of gene therapy holds the promise of targeting the etiology of diseases and ensuring a sustained correction. This approach is particularly enticing for neurodegenerative diseases, where traditional pharmacological methods have fallen short. In the context of our exploration of the genetic epidemiology of the three most prevalent NDDs-amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease, and Parkinson's disease, our primary goal is to underscore the progress made in the development of next-generation sequencing. This progress aims to enhance our understanding of the disease mechanisms and explore gene-based therapies for NDDs. Throughout this review, we focus on genetic variations, methodologies for their identification, the associated pathophysiology, and the promising potential of gene therapy. Ultimately, our objective is to provide a comprehensive and forward-looking perspective on the emerging research arena of NDDs.",38396996,PMC10889342,10.3390/ijms25042320,1
Genome-Wide Mapping Implicates 5-Hydroxymethylcytosines in Diabetes Mellitus and Alzheimer's Disease,"Background:Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a recognized risk factor for dementia. Because DM is a potentially modifiable condition, greater understanding of the mechanisms linking DM to the clinical expression of Alzheimer's disease dementia may provide insights into much needed dementia therapeutics.Objective:In this feasibility study, we investigated DM as a dementia risk factor by examining genome-wide distributions of the epigenetic DNA modification 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC).Methods:We obtained biologic samples from the Rush Memory and Aging Project and used the highly sensitive 5hmC-Seal technique to perform genome-wide profiling of 5hmC in circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) from antemortem serum samples and in genomic DNA from postmortem prefrontal cortex brain tissue from 80 individuals across four groups: Alzheimer's disease neuropathologically defined (AD), DM clinically defined, AD with DM, and individuals with neither disease (controls).Results:Distinct 5hmC signatures and biological pathways were enriched in persons with both AD and DM versus AD alone, DM alone, or controls, including genes inhibited by EGFR signaling in oligodendroglia and those activated by constitutive RHOA. We also demonstrate the potential diagnostic value of 5hmC profiling in circulating cfDNA. Specifically, an 11-gene weighted model distinguished AD from non-AD/non-DM controls (AUC = 91.8%; 95% CI, 82.9-100.0%), while a 4-gene model distinguished DM-associated AD from AD alone (AUC = 87.9%; 95% CI, 77.5-98.3%).Conclusion:We demonstrate in this small sample, the feasibility of detecting and characterizing 5hmC in DM-associated AD and of using 5hmC information contained in circulating cfDNA to detect AD in high-risk individuals, such as those with diabetes.",37182870,PMC10490934,10.3233/JAD-221113,2
Preclinical Alzheimer's Disease: Implications for Refinement of the Concept,"Increasing interest in clinical trials and clinical research settings to identify Alzheimer's disease (AD) in the earliest stages of the disease has led to the concept of preclinical AD. Individuals with preclinical AD have AD pathology without clinical symptoms yet. Accumulating evidence has shown that biomarkers can identify preclinical AD and that preclinical AD is associated with a poor clinical outcome. Little is known yet about the role of vascular and lifestyle risk factors in the development of preclinical AD. In order to better understand preclinical AD pathology and clinical progression rates, there is a need to refine the concept of preclinical AD. This will be of great value for advancements in future research, clinical trials, and eventually clinical practice.",29865060,,10.3233/JAD-179943,7
The Gut Microbiota and Alzheimer's Disease,"The gut microbiota comprises a complex community of microorganism species that resides in our gastrointestinal ecosystem and whose alterations influence not only various gut disorders but also central nervous system disorders such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). AD, the most common form of dementia, is a neurodegenerative disorder associated with impaired cognition and cerebral accumulation of amyloid-β peptides (Aβ). Most notably, the microbiota-gut-brain axis is a bidirectional communication system that is not fully understood, but includes neural, immune, endocrine, and metabolic pathways. Studies in germ-free animals and in animals exposed to pathogenic microbial infections, antibiotics, probiotics, or fecal microbiota transplantation suggest a role for the gut microbiota in host cognition or AD-related pathogenesis. The increased permeability of the gut and blood-brain barrier induced by microbiota dysbiosis may mediate or affect AD pathogenesis and other neurodegenerative disorders, especially those associated with aging. In addition, bacteria populating the gut microbiota can secrete large amounts of amyloids and lipopolysaccharides, which might contribute to the modulation of signaling pathways and the production of proinflammatory cytokines associated with the pathogenesis of AD. Moreover, imbalances in the gut microbiota can induce inflammation that is associated with the pathogenesis of obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and AD. The purpose of this review is to summarize and discuss the current findings that may elucidate the role of the gut microbiota in the development of AD. Understanding the underlying mechanisms may provide new insights into novel therapeutic strategies for AD.",28372330,,10.3233/JAD-161141,322
Olfactory neuropathology in Alzheimer's disease: a sign of ongoing neurodegeneration,"Olfactory neuropathology is a cause of olfactory loss in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Olfactory dysfunction is also associated with memory and cognitive dysfunction and is an incidental finding of AD dementia. Here we review neuropathological research on the olfactory system in AD, considering both structural and functional evidence. Experimental and clinical findings identify olfactory dysfunction as an early indicator of AD. In keeping with this, amyloid-β production and neuroinflammation are related to underlying causes of impaired olfaction. Notably, physiological features of the spatial map in the olfactory system suggest the evidence of ongoing neurodegeneration. Our aim in this review is to examine olfactory pathology findings essential to identifying mechanisms of olfactory dysfunction in the development of AD in hopes of supporting investigations leading towards revealing potential diagnostic methods and causes of early pathogenesis in the olfactory system.

[Alzheimer's disease],"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a serious medical and social problem of our time, while remaining the most common cause of dementia in the elderly. The leading symptom in the clinical picture of the disease is a progressive loss of memory with further development of behavioral disorders. In the early stages of AD, patients are mostly managed by neurologists and differential diagnosis is carried out with a variety of neurodegenerative diseases. The authors present clinical criteria of AD diagnosis and consider diagnostic possibilities in the predementia stage using biological markers. With this purpose, modern concepts of the etiology and pathogenesis of AD and genetic aspects of pathology are considered. Contribution of many environmental factors to the initiation and progression of the disease process is evaluated. Mechanisms of cerebral amyloidosis and its characteristic neurological manifestations are considered.",29460910,,10.17116/jnevro20181181177-81,1
Peptides isolated from animal venom as a platform for new therapeutics for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease that deeply affects patients, their family and society. Although scientists have made intense efforts in seeking the cure for AD, no drug available today is able to stop AD progression. In this context, compounds isolated from animal venom are potentially successful drugs for neuroprotection, since they selectively bind to nervous system targets. In this review, we presented different studies using peptides isolated from animal venom for the treatment of AD. This is a growing field that will be very helpful in understanding and even curing neurodegenerative diseases, especially AD.",29198480,,10.1016/j.npep.2017.11.010,1
Immunogenetic Factors of Neurodegenerative Diseases: The Role of HLA Class II,"An increase in the life expectancy during the last decades in most world countries has resulted in the growing number of people suffering from neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, frontotemporal dementia, and others. Familial forms of neurodegenerative diseases account for 5-10% of all cases and are caused by mutations in specific genes often resulting in pathological protein deposition. The risk factors for neurodegeneration include trauma, lifestyle, and allelic variants of disease-associated genes with incomplete penetrance. Many of these gene variants are located in immunity-related loci, particularly in the human leukocyte antigen locus (HLA class II) coding for proteins of the major histocompatibility complex class II (MHCII). HLA class II plays a key role in the antigen presentation and is expressed in microglial cells. Microglia is a component of innate immunity. On the one hand, microglial cells phagocytize pathological protein deposits; on the other hand, they produce proinflammatory factors accelerating neuronal death. The involvement of adaptive immunity mechanisms (antigen presentation, T cell response, antibody production) in the development of neurodegenerative diseases remains unclear and requires further research, including more detailed studies of the role of identified HLA class II genetic variants.",30472949,,10.1134/S0006297918090122,13
"Development of Multifunctional Molecules as Potential Therapeutic Candidates for Alzheimer's Disease, Parkinson's Disease, and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis in the Last Decade","Neurodegenerative diseases pose a substantial socioeconomic burden on society. Unfortunately, the aging world population and lack of effective cures foreshadow a negative outlook. Although a large amount of research has been dedicated to elucidating the pathologies of neurodegenerative diseases, their principal causes remain elusive. Metal ion dyshomeostasis, proteopathy, oxidative stress, and neurotransmitter deficiencies are pathological features shared across multiple neurodegenerative disorders. In addition, these factors are proposed to be interrelated upon disease progression. Thus, the development of multifunctional compounds capable of simultaneously interacting with several pathological components has been suggested as a solution to undertake the complex pathologies of neurodegenerative diseases. In this review, we outline and discuss possible therapeutic targets in Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and molecules, previously designed or discovered as potential drug candidates for these disorders with emphasis on multifunctionality. In addition, underrepresented areas of research are discussed to indicate new directions.",30095897,,10.1021/acs.chemrev.8b00138,124
"An overview on therapeutic and medicinal potential of poly-hydroxy flavone viz. Heptamethoxyflavone, Kaempferitrin, Vitexin and Amentoflavone for management of Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases: a critical analysis on mechanistic insight","Neurodegenerative disorders occur when nerve cells in the brain or peripheral nervous system partial or complete fail in their functions and sometimes even die due to some injuries or aging. Neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and Parkinson's Disease (PD), have been majorly resulted due to degeneration of neurons and neuroinflammation progressively. There are many similarities that correlates both AD and PD on a cellular and sub-cellular level. Therefore, a hope for therapeutic advancement for simultaneous upgradation in both the diseases are directly depending on the discovery of common mechanism at molecular and cellular level. Recent and past evidences from scientific literature supporting the efficacy of plants flavonoids in treatment and protection of both AD and PD. Further, dietary flavones, specially Heptamethoxyflavone, Kaempferitrin, Vitexin and Amentoflavone gains recently much more attention for producing many health beneficiary effects including neuroprotection. Despite of these evidence a detailed updated overview of neuroprotective effects against both AD and PD by Heptamethoxyflavone, Kaempferitrin, Vitexin and Amentoflavone are still missing. In this context several published studies were assessed by using various online electronic search engines/databases to meet the objective from 1981 to 2021 (Approx. 224). Therefore, present review was designed to deliver the detailed description on these flavones including therapeutic benefits in AD, PD and other CNS complications with critical analysis on underlying mechanisms.",34590507,,10.1080/10408398.2021.1980761,4
Conquering Alzheimer's Disease by Self Treatment,"The means are now at hand to conquer Alzheimer's disease (AD). The method is to identify those at risk for the disease before clinical signs develop. That is followed by implementing measures that can effectively prevent disease development. Since biotechnology markers have shown that AD commences at least a decade before cognitive deficits set in, there is an extended window of opportunity to successfully prevent disease development. Methods of identifying those at risk include positron electron microscopy for AD senile plaques, blood or saliva analysis for elevation of the amyloid-β protein fragment terminating at position 42, and cerebrospinal fluid analysis showing a decrease in content of this protein. Of the modalities available, saliva is by far the simplest and least invasive. Once identified, those at risk can prevent disease development through self treatment by consumption of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, adhering to a Mediterranean diet, and consuming antioxidants such as quercitin which is contained in coffee.",29562519,,10.3233/JAD-179913,2
Mesenchymal Stem Cells for Treating Alzheimer's Disease: Cell Therapy and Chemical Reagent Pretreatment,"As the size of the population aged 65 and older continues to grow, the incidence and mortality rates of Alzheimer's disease (AD) are increasing annually. Unfortunately, current treatments only treat symptoms temporarily and do not alter the patients' life expectancy or course of AD. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have shown a certain therapeutic potential in neurodegenerative diseases including AD due to their neuroinflammatory regulation and neuroprotective effects. However, the low survival and homing rates of MSCs after transplantation seriously affect their therapeutic effectiveness. Therefore, appropriate in vitro preconditioning is necessary to increase the survival and homing rates of MSCs to improve their effectiveness in treating AD. Here we summarize the therapeutic mechanisms of MSCs in AD and the chemical reagents used for the pretreatment of MSCs.",37125553,,10.3233/JAD-221253,0
Multi sequence average templates for aging and neurodegenerative disease populations,"Magnetic resonance image (MRI) processing pipelines use average templates to enable standardization of individual MRIs in a common space. MNI-ICBM152 is currently used as the standard template by most MRI processing tools. However, MNI-ICBM152 represents an average of 152 healthy young adult brains and is vastly different from brains of patients with neurodegenerative diseases. In those populations, extensive atrophy might cause inevitable registration errors when using an average template of young healthy individuals for standardization. Disease-specific templates that represent the anatomical characteristics of the populations can reduce such errors and improve downstream driven estimates. We present multi-sequence average templates for Alzheimer's Dementia (AD), Fronto-temporal Dementia (FTD), Lewy Body Dementia (LBD), Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), cognitively intact and impaired Parkinson's Disease patients (PD-CIE and PD-CI, respectively), individuals with Subjective Cognitive Impairment (SCI), AD with vascular contribution (V-AD), Vascular Mild Cognitive Impairment (V-MCI), Cognitively Intact Elderly (CIE) individuals, and a human phantom.

Safety and Tolerability of APOE Genotyping and Disclosure in Cognitively Normal Volunteers From the Butler Alzheimer's Prevention Registry,"Aims:Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a gradually progressive neurodegenerative disease that ultimately results in total loss of cognitive and functional independence in older adults. This study aimed to examine the safety and tolerability ofAPOEdisclosure in community-dwelling, cognitively normal (CN) older adults from the Butler Alzheimer's Prevention Registry (BAPR), and to determine whetherAPOEdisclosure impacted participant's decisions to participate in AD clinical research.Methods:186 (N = 106 ∊4 non-carriers, 80 ∊4 carriers) CN older adults aged 58-78 from the BAPR completed 2 visits: one for psychological readiness screening and genotyping and one forAPOEdisclosure. Online follow-ups were completed 3 days, 6 weeks, and 6 months post-disclosure. Primary outcomes were scores on self-report measures of depression, anxiety, impact of events, and perceived risk of AD, along with enrollment in AD clinical trials.Results:∊4 carriers and non-carriers did not differ significantly on measures of depression, anxiety, or suicidal ideation over the 6-month follow-up period. ∊4 carriers reported higher impact of disclosure than non-carriers immediately after disclosure, but both groups' scores on impact of events measures remained sub-clinical. ∊4 carriers and non-carriers were equally likely to participate in AD research after disclosure, with genotype-dependent differences in type of clinical trial enrollment.Conclusions:APOEgenotyping and disclosure was safe and well tolerated in a group of CN, community-dwelling older adults, who were pre-screened after volunteering for AD research through BAPR. Implications for the inclusion ofAPOEgenotyping and disclosure at AD clinical trial sites are discussed.",33550928,,10.1177/0891988721993575,3
Predicting and Characterizing Neurodegenerative Subtypes with Multimodal Neurocognitive Signatures of Social and Cognitive Processes,"Background:Social cognition is critically compromised across neurodegenerative diseases, including the behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD), Alzheimer's disease (AD), and Parkinson's disease (PD). However, no previous study has used social cognition and other cognitive tasks to predict diagnoses of these conditions, let alone reporting the brain correlates of prediction outcomes.Objective:We performed a diagnostic classification analysis using social cognition, cognitive screening (CS), and executive function (EF) measures, and explored which anatomical and functional networks were associated with main predictors.Methods:Multiple group discriminant function analyses (MDAs) and ROC analyses of social cognition (facial emotional recognition, theory of mind), CS, and EF were implemented in 223 participants (bvFTD, AD, PD, controls). Gray matter volume and functional connectivity correlates of top discriminant scores were investigated.Results:Although all patient groups revealed deficits in social cognition, CS, and EF, our classification approach provided robust discriminatory characterizations. Regarding controls, probabilistic social cognition outcomes provided the best characterization for bvFTD (together with CS) and PD, but not AD (for which CS alone was the best predictor). Within patient groups, the best MDA probabilities scores yielded high classification rates for bvFTD versus PD (98.3%, social cognition), AD versus PD (98.6%, social cognition + CS), and bvFTD versus AD (71.7%, social cognition + CS). Top MDA scores were associated with specific patterns of atrophy and functional networks across neurodegenerative conditions.Conclusion:Standardized validated measures of social cognition, in combination with CS, can provide a dimensional classification with specific pathophysiological markers of neurodegeneration diagnoses.",34275897,PMC8461708,10.3233/JAD-210163,13
"Novel 1,4,5,6-tetrahydrocyclopenta[d]imidazole-5-carboxamide-based JNK3 inhibitors: Design, synthesis, molecular docking, and therapeutic potential in neurodegenerative diseases","JNK3 is a key factor driving the pathophysiology of neuronal apoptosis. Since demonstrating the therapeutic potential of JNK3 inhibitors in Alzheimer's disease, we aimed to broaden their chemical diversity for drug development. In continuation with our previous research, a series of compounds with the tetrahydrocyclopenta[d]imidazole scaffold as a core moiety was developed as JNK3 inhibitors based on in silico modeling analysis. The biochemical kinase assay results revealed that the JNK3 inhibitory effects and isoform selectivity of the compounds developed in this study were significantly higher than that of previously developed inhibitors. In particular, the IC50values of compounds 18c, 19c, 22b, and 26c, which exhibited excelled isoform selectivity, against JNK3 were 0.716, 0.564, 0.379, and 0.779 nM, respectively, which were more potent than those of any known JNK3 inhibitors. Additionally, compounds 18c, 18c, 22b, and 22c effectively protected the neuronal cells against amyloid beta-induced apoptosis. Docking studies indicated that the tetrahydrocyclopenta[d]imidazole scaffold retained all the optimal interactions. Meanwhile, BBB PAMPA and ADME prediction suggested that the tested compounds had a favorable BBB permeability and pharmacokinetic profile. Therefore, the tetrahydrocyclopenta[d]imidazole scaffold is a promising candidate for developing JNK3 inhibitors. In particular, compound 22b is a potential starting point for the preclinical optimization of novel JNK3 inhibitors.",36395646,,10.1016/j.ejmech.2022.114917,3
Imaging tau and amyloid-β proteinopathies in Alzheimer disease and other conditions,"Most neurodegenerative disorders are associated with aggregated protein deposits. In the case of Alzheimer disease (AD), extracellular amyloid-β (Aβ) aggregates and intracellular tau neurofibrillary tangles are the two neuropathological hallmarks of the disease. Aβ-PET imaging has already been approved for clinical use and is being used in clinical trials of anti-Aβ therapies both for patient recruitment and as an outcome measure. These studies have shown that Aβ accumulation is a protracted process that can extend for more than 2 decades before the onset of clinical AD. This Review describes how in vivo brain imaging of Aβ pathology has revolutionized the evaluation of patients with clinical AD by providing robust and reproducible statements of global or regional brain Aβ burden and enabling the monitoring of disease progression. The role of selective tau imaging is discussed, focusing on how longitudinal tau and Aβ imaging studies might reveal the various effects (sequential and/or parallel, independent and/or synergistic) of these proteins on progression, cognition and other disease-specific biomarkers of neurodegeneration. Finally, imaging studies are discussed in the context of elucidating the respective roles of Aβ and tau in AD and in advancing our understanding of the relationship and/or interplay between these two proteinopathies.",29449700,,10.1038/nrneurol.2018.9,154
Potential human transmission of amyloid β pathology: surveillance and risks,"Studies in experimental animals show transmissibility of amyloidogenic proteins associated with prion diseases, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and other neurodegenerative diseases. Although these data raise potential concerns for public health, convincing evidence for human iatrogenic transmission only exists for prions and amyloid β after systemic injections of contaminated growth hormone extracts or dura mater grafts derived from cadavers. Even though these procedures are now obsolete, some reports raise the possibility of iatrogenic transmission of amyloid β through putatively contaminated neurosurgical equipment. Iatrogenic transmission of amyloid β might lead to amyloid deposition in the brain parenchyma and blood vessel walls, potentially resulting in cerebral amyloid angiopathy after several decades. Cerebral amyloid angiopathy can cause life-threatening brain haemorrhages; yet, there is no proof that the transmission of amyloid β can also lead to Alzheimer's dementia. Large, long-term epidemiological studies and sensitive, cost-efficient tools to detect amyloid are needed to better understand any potential routes of amyloid β transmission and to clarify whether other similar proteopathic seeds, such as tau or α-synuclein, can also be transferred iatrogenically.",32949547,,10.1016/S1474-4422(20)30238-6,26
Could it be that neurodegenerative diseases are infectious?,"The cell-to-cell transmission of the major pathogenic proteins of Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease is reminiscent of the prion protein, which is defined as a proteinaceous infectious particle that causes human and animal transmissible spongiform encephalopathies. The possibility has raised that the pathogenic proteins of Parkinson's and Alzheimer's disease are infectious, i.e. that they can transmit disease from human to human. In this review, we address this question by comparing the similarities and differences between Alzheimer's disease/Parkinson's disease pathological proteins and prions and by discussing the possible consequences for disease transmission risk.",31358351,,10.1016/j.neurol.2019.07.003,3
Dietary Trace Elements and the Pathogenesis of Neurodegenerative Diseases,"Trace elements such as iron (Fe), zinc (Zn), copper (Cu), and manganese (Mn) are absorbed from food via the gastrointestinal tract, transported into the brain, and play central roles in normal brain functions. An excess of these trace elements often produces reactive oxygen species and damages the brain. Moreover, increasing evidence suggests that the dyshomeostasis of these metals is involved in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease, prion diseases, and Lewy body diseases. The disease-related amyloidogenic proteins can regulate metal homeostasis at the synapses, and thus loss of the protective functions of these amyloidogenic proteins causes neurodegeneration. Meanwhile, metal-induced conformational changes of the amyloidogenic proteins contribute to enhancing their neurotoxicity. Moreover, excess Zn and Cu play central roles in the pathogenesis of vascular-type senile dementia. Here, we present an overview of the intake, absorption, and transport of four essential elements (Fe, Zn, Cu, Mn) and one non-essential element (aluminum: Al) in food and their connections with the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases based on metal-protein, and metal-metal cross-talk.",37432185,PMC10180548,10.3390/nu15092067,2
Evidence to Consider Angiotensin II Receptor Blockers for the Treatment of Early Alzheimer's Disease,"Alzheimer's disease is the most frequent type of dementia and diagnosed late in the progression of the illness when irreversible brain tissue loss has already occurred. For this reason, treatments have been ineffective. It is imperative to find novel therapies ameliorating modifiable risk factors (hypertension, stroke, diabetes, chronic kidney disease, and traumatic brain injury) and effective against early pathogenic mechanisms including alterations in cerebral blood flow leading to poor oxygenation and decreased access to nutrients, impaired glucose metabolism, chronic inflammation, and glutamate excitotoxicity. Angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) fulfill these requirements. ARBs are directly neuroprotective against early injury factors in neuronal, astrocyte, microglia, and cerebrovascular endothelial cell cultures. ARBs protect cerebral blood flow and reduce injury to the blood brain barrier and neurological and cognitive loss in animal models of brain ischemia, traumatic brain injury, and Alzheimer's disease. These compounds are clinically effective against major risk factors for Alzheimer's disease: hypertension, stroke, chronic kidney disease, diabetes and metabolic syndrome, and ameliorate age-dependent cognitive loss. Controlled studies on hypertensive patients, open trials, case reports, and database meta-analysis indicate significant therapeutic effects of ARBs in Alzheimer's disease. ARBs are safe compounds, widely used to treat cardiovascular and metabolic disorders in humans, and although they reduce hypertension, they do not affect blood pressure in normotensive individuals. Overall, there is sufficient evidence to consider long-term controlled clinical studies with ARBs in patients suffering from established risk factors, in patients with early cognitive loss, or in normal individuals when reliable biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease risk are identified.",26993513,,10.1007/s10571-015-0327-y,39
"Alternative cleavage and polyadenylation of genes associated with protein turnover and mitochondrial function are deregulated in Parkinson's, Alzheimer's and ALS disease","Background:Transcriptome wide changes have been assessed extensively during the progression of neurodegenerative diseases. Alternative polyadenylation (APA) occurs in over 70% of human protein coding genes and it has recently been recognised as a critical regulator of gene expression during disease. However, the effect of APA in the context of neurodegenerative diseases, to date, has not been widely investigated. Dynamic Analysis of Alternative Polyadenylation from RNA-seq (DaPars) is a method by Xia and colleagues [Nat Commun. 5:5274, 2014] to investigate APA using standard RNA-seq data. Here, we employed this method to interrogate APA using publicly available RNA-seq data from Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD) and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) patients and matched healthy individuals.Results:For all three diseases, we found that APA profile changes were limited to a relative small number of genes suggesting that APA is not globally deregulated in neurodegenerative disease. However, for each disease phenotype we identified a subgroup of genes that showed disease-specific deregulation of APA. Whilst the affected genes differ between the RNA-seq datasets, in each cohort we identified an overrepresentation of genes that are associated with protein turnover pathways and mitochondrial function.Conclusions:Our findings, while drawn from a relatively small sample size, suggest that deregulation of APA may play a significant role in neurodegeneration by altering the expression of genes including UBR1 and OGDHL in AD, LONP1 in PD and UCHL1 in ALS. This report thus provides important novel insights into how APA can shape neurodegenerative disease characteristic transcriptomes.",31072331,PMC6507032,10.1186/s12920-019-0509-4,14
Disturbed calcium signaling in spinocerebellar ataxias and Alzheimer's disease,"Neurodegenerative disorders, such as spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) represent a huge scientific and medical question, but the molecular mechanisms of these diseases are still not clear. There is increasing evidence that neuronal calcium signaling is abnormal in many neurodegenerative disorders. Abnormal neuronal calcium release from the endoplasmic reticulum may result in disturbances of cell homeostasis, synaptic dysfunction, and eventual cell death. Neuronal loss is observed in most cases of neurodegenerative diseases. Recent experimental evidence supporting the role of neuronal calcium signaling in the pathogenesis of SCAs and AD is discussed in this review.",25846864,PMC4433580,10.1016/j.semcdb.2015.03.010,27
"Prospective Associations between Single Foods, Alzheimer's Dementia and Memory Decline in the Elderly","Background: Evidence whether single &ldquo;cognitive health&rdquo; foods could prevent cognitive decline is limited. We investigated whether dietary intake of red wine, white wine, coffee, green tea, olive oil, fresh fish, fruits and vegetables, red meat and sausages, assessed by a single-food-questionnaire, would be associated with either incident Alzheimer&rsquo;s dementia (AD) or verbal memory decline.Methods:Participants aged 75+ of the German Study on Aging, Cognition and Dementia in Primary Care Patients (AgeCoDe) cohort were regularly followed over 10 years (n= 2622;n= 418 incident AD cases). Multivariable-adjusted joint modeling of repeated-measures and survival analysis was used, taking gender and Apolipoprotein E4 (APOE&epsilon;4) genotype into account as possible effect modifiers.Results: Only higher red wine intake was associated with a lower incidence of AD (HR= 0.92;P= 0.045). Interestingly, this was true only for men (HR= 0.82;P< 0.001), while in women higher red wine intake was associated with a higher incidence of AD (HR= 1.15;P= 0.044), and higher white wine intake with a more pronounced memory decline over time (HR= &minus;0.13;P= 0.052).Conclusion: We found no evidence for these single foods to be protective against cognitive decline, with the exception of red wine, which reduced the risk for AD only in men. Women could be more susceptible to detrimental effects of alcohol.",29966314,PMC6073331,10.3390/nu10070852,33
Unveiling the sound of the cognitive status: Machine Learning-based speech analysis in the Alzheimer's disease spectrum,"Background:Advancement in screening tools accessible to the general population for the early detection of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and prediction of its progression is essential for achieving timely therapeutic interventions and conducting decentralized clinical trials. This study delves into the application of Machine Learning (ML) techniques by leveraging paralinguistic features extracted directly from a brief spontaneous speech (SS) protocol. We aimed to explore the capability of ML techniques to discriminate between different degrees of cognitive impairment based on SS. Furthermore, for the first time, this study investigates the relationship between paralinguistic features from SS and cognitive function within the AD spectrum.Methods:Physical-acoustic features were extracted from voice recordings of patients evaluated in a memory unit who underwent a SS protocol. We implemented several ML models evaluated via cross-validation to identify individuals without cognitive impairment (subjective cognitive decline, SCD), with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and with dementia due to AD (ADD). In addition, we established models capable of predicting cognitive domain performance based on a comprehensive neuropsychological battery from Fundació Ace (NBACE) using SS-derived information.Results:The results of this study showed that, based on a paralinguistic analysis of sound, it is possible to identify individuals with ADD (F1 = 0.92) and MCI (F1 = 0.84). Furthermore, our models, based on physical acoustic information, exhibited correlations greater than 0.5 for predicting the cognitive domains of attention, memory, executive functions, language, and visuospatial ability.Conclusions:In this study, we show the potential of a brief and cost-effective SS protocol in distinguishing between different degrees of cognitive impairment and forecasting performance in cognitive domains commonly affected within the AD spectrum. Our results demonstrate a high correspondence with protocols traditionally used to assess cognitive function. Overall, it opens up novel prospects for developing screening tools and remote disease monitoring.",38308366,PMC10835990,10.1186/s13195-024-01394-y,1
[Neuroinflammation as motor of Alzheimer's disease],"Sporadic Alzheimer's disease is the most common neurodegenerative disorder and represents a very important public healthcare problem with a devastating economic burden for industrialized countries. Recent knowledge acquired from experimental, epidemiological, radiological and genome-wide association studies (GWAS) underline the role of the innate immune system in the pathophysiology of this disease. This article reviews and discusses the function of the cerebral innate immune system, the newly discovered genes associated with the disease development and the experimental evidence around the role of microglia in the onset and progression of Alzheimer's disease. The discovery of different microglia phenotypes associated with the pathology as well as new molecular players will enable the development of new preventive and therapeutic strategies by modulating neuroinflammation in neurodegenerative diseases.",31428829,,10.1007/s00115-019-0778-3,5
Mechanistic comparison of current pharmacological treatments and novel phytochemicals to target amyloid peptides in Alzheimer's and neurodegenerative diseases,"The formation of β amyloid plaques is one of the pathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The process of accumulation of extracellular deposits of amyloid plaques occurs by the abnormal proteolysis of amyloid precursor protein, resulting in the formation of β amyloid peptides which further aggregates and results in the formation of oligomers, protofibrils, fibrils, and plaques. The complexity in understanding the aggregation process has provided avenues for identifying potential targets against amyloid toxicity in the treatment of AD. The therapeutic approach mainly focuses on reducing the toxicity by halting the β amyloid fibril formation. Besides conventional medicine, several naturally available compounds were shown to reduce the toxicity of amyloid plaques in the current scenario. This review provides a comprehensive account on recent updates of FDA-approved and naturally available compounds against toxicity of amyloid peptides and plaques both in vitro and in vivo.",28683598,,10.1080/1028415X.2017.1345425,4
Distinct Interplay Between Atrophy and Hypometabolism in Alzheimer's Versus Semantic Dementia,"Multimodal neuroimaging analyses offer additional information beyond that provided by each neuroimaging modality. Thus, direct comparisons and correlations between neuroimaging modalities allow revealing disease-specific topographic relationships. Here, we compared the topographic discrepancies between atrophy and hypometabolism in two neurodegenerative diseases characterized by distinct pathological processes, namely Alzheimer's disease (AD) versus semantic dementia (SD), to unravel their specific influence on local and global brain structure-function relationships. We found that intermodality topographic discrepancies clearly distinguished the two patient groups: AD showed marked discrepancies between both alterations, with greater hypometabolism than atrophy in large posterior associative neocortical regions, while SD showed more topographic consistency between atrophy and hypometabolism across brain regions. These findings likely reflect the multiple pathologies versus the relatively unitary pathological process underlying AD versus SD respectively. Our results evidence that multimodal neuroimaging-derived indexes can provide clinically relevant information to discriminate the two diseases, and potentially reveal distinct neuropathological processes.",29668866,,10.1093/cercor/bhy069,16
T Cells: A Growing Universe of Roles in Neurodegenerative Diseases,"T cells play a central role in homeostasis and host defense against infectious diseases. T cell dysregulation can lead to recognizing self-antigens as foreign antigens, causing a detrimental autoimmune response. T cell involvement in multiple sclerosis (MS), long understood to be an autoimmune-mediated neurodegenerative disease, is well characterized. More recently, a role for T cells has also been identified for the neurodegenerative diseases Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Interestingly, several alleles and variants of human leukocyte antigen (HLA) genes have been classified as AD and PD risk genes. HLA codes for components of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I or class II, both of which are expressed by microglia, the innate immune cells of the central nervous system (CNS). Thus, both microglia and T cells may potentially interact in an antigen-dependent or independent fashion to shape the inflammatory cascade occurring in neurodegenerative diseases. Dissecting the antigen specificity of T cells may lead to new options for disease-modifying treatments in neurodegenerative diseases. Here, we review the current understanding of T cells in neurodegenerative diseases. We summarize the subsets of T cells, their phenotype and potential functions in animal models and in human studies of neurodegenerative diseases.",34160330,,10.1177/10738584211024907,15
An Insight into the Protein Aggregation in Alzheimer's Disease and its Inhibition,"Alzheimer's disease, a neurodegenerative disease, is a progressive and irreversible disease that has become a global challenge due to its increasing prevalence and absence of available potential therapies. Protein misfolding and aggregation are known to be the root of several protein neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease. Protein aggregation is a phenomenon where misfolded proteins accumulate and clump together intra-or extracellularly. This accumulation of misfolded amyloid proteins leads to the formation of plaquesin the neuronal cells, also known as amyloid β plaques. The synthesis of amyloid β plaques and tau protein aggregation are the hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease. Potential therapeutics must be developed in conjunction with an understanding of the possible root cause involving complex mechanisms. The development of therapeutics that can inhibit protein misfolding and aggregation, involved in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease, could be one of the potential solutions to the disease.",37953619,,10.2174/0109298665247757231020044633,0
Traumatic brain injury: a risk factor for neurodegenerative diseases,"Traumatic brain injury (TBI), a major global health and socioeconomic problem, is now established as a chronic disease process with a broad spectrum of pathophysiological symptoms followed by long-term disabilities. It triggers multiple and multidirectional biochemical events that lead to neurodegeneration and cognitive impairment. Recent studies have presented strong evidence that patients with TBI history have a tendency to develop proteinopathy, which is the pathophysiological feature of neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer disease (AD), chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). This review mainly focuses on mechanisms related to AD, CTE, and ALS that are induced after TBI and their relevance to the advancement of these neurodegenerative diseases. This review encompasses acute effects and chronic neurodegenerative consequences after TBI for a better understanding of TBI-induced neuronal death and to design therapies that will effectively treat patients in the primary or secondary progressive stages.",26352199,,10.1515/revneuro-2015-0017,55
"Traumatic Brain Injury, Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy, and Alzheimer Disease","Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a major health and economic burden. With increasing aging population, this issue is expected to continue to rise. Neurodegenerative disorders are more common with aging population in general regardless of history of TBI. Recent evidence continues to support a relation between a TBI and neurocognitive decline later in life (such as in athletes and military). This article summarizes the pathologic and clinical effects of TBI (regardless of severity) on the later development of dementia in individuals 65 years or older.",30336991,,10.1016/j.cger.2018.06.008,13
Next generation tau models in Alzheimer's disease research - virus based gene delivery systems,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) the most common form of dementia is characterized by cognitive decline and progressive loss of neurons in the central nervous system. Despite huge scientific progress, there are only few animal models that recapitulate at least majority of the AD pathology and related symptomatology. Therefore, alternative methods to develop animal models for neurodegenerative diseases are constantly explored. Recently, recombinant adeno-associated viruses (AAVs) are widely used viral vectors in development of novel models for neurodegenerative diseases. AAV vectors expressing full length, mutant or truncated forms of tau demonstrate early and robust pathology characterized by AT8 positivity, NFT formation, motor and cognitive deficits. Furthermore, AAVs have been used in expression of tau in amyloid rodent models thus developing both lesions of amyloid and tau therefore recapitulating AD like features. Major advantage of AAV as a delivery system is the site specific expression of tau, mostly in hippocampus and cortex, and thus elimination of unwanted ectopic transgene expression. These novel models may help in better understanding of AD etiopathogenesis and provide a platform for development and testing of disease modifying drugs in preclinical efficacy studies.",28105850,,10.4149/av_2017_01_13,1
"Biological Potential, Gastrointestinal Digestion, Absorption, and Bioavailability of Algae-Derived Compounds with Neuroprotective Activity: A Comprehensive Review","Currently, there is no known cure for neurodegenerative disease. However, the available therapies aim to manage some of the symptoms of the disease. Human neurodegenerative diseases are a heterogeneous group of illnesses characterized by progressive loss of neuronal cells and nervous system dysfunction related to several mechanisms such as protein aggregation, neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, and neurotransmission dysfunction. Neuroprotective compounds are essential in the prevention and management of neurodegenerative diseases. This review will focus on the neurodegeneration mechanisms and the compounds (proteins, polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), polysaccharides, carotenoids, phycobiliproteins, phenolic compounds, among others) present in seaweeds that have shown in vivo and in vitro neuroprotective activity. Additionally, it will cover the recent findings on the neuroprotective effects of bioactive compounds from macroalgae, with a focus on their biological potential and possible mechanism of action, including microbiota modulation. Furthermore, gastrointestinal digestion, absorption, and bioavailability will be discussed. Moreover, the clinical trials using seaweed-based drugs or extracts to treat neurodegenerative disorders will be presented, showing the real potential and limitations that a specific metabolite or extract may have as a new therapeutic agent considering the recent approval of a seaweed-based drug to treat Alzheimer's disease.",35736165,PMC9227170,10.3390/md20060362,8
Depression in neurodegenerative diseases: Common mechanisms and current treatment options,"Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a highly prevalent psychiatric disorder and a major cause of disability worldwide. This neurological condition is commonly associated with neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD) and Huntington's disease (HD), and has a significant impact on the increasing burden of these neuropathologies. Over the past decades, some of the pathophysiological and molecular mechanisms that contribute to these diseases have been elucidated and these findings indicate that, despite presenting distinct features, there are several similarities between the neurobiological alterations that lead to MDD and neurodegeneration in AD, PD, and HD. For instance, disturbances in monoaminergic transmission and the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, increased oxidative and neuroinflammatory events, and impaired trophic support are thought to contribute to neuronal atrophy and death in all these diseases. In addition, neuroimaging findings have helped elucidate the structural and functional changes implicated in the relationship between depression and neurodegeneration, thus establishing a neuroanatomical signature to explain, at least in part, the comorbidity between MDD and AD, PD, and HD. The present review summarizes these findings and the current evidence regarding the effectiveness of common antidepressant therapies for the treatment of MDD in patients with these neurodegenerative diseases. This population is particularly vulnerable to the drawdowns of conventional antidepressant therapy (namely inadequate response and high risk of side effects), and the development of emerging therapeutic approaches to treat MDD in patients with AD, PD, and HD is thus of paramount importance to improve the quality of life of these individuals.",30995512,,10.1016/j.neubiorev.2019.04.002,73
Identifying Biomarkers of Alzheimer's Disease via a Novel Structured Sparse Canonical Correlation Analysis Approach,"Using correlation analysis to study the potential connection between brain genetics and imaging has become an effective method to understand neurodegenerative diseases. Sparse canonical correlation analysis (SCCA) makes it possible to study high-dimensional genetic information. The traditional SCCA methods can only process single-modal genetic and image data, which to some extent weaken the close connection of the brain's biological network. In some recently proposed multimodal SCCA methods, due to the limitations of penalty items, the pre-processed data needs to be further filtered to make the dimensions uniform, which may destroy the potential association of data in the same modal. In this research, in order to combine data between different modalities and to ensure that the chain relationship or graph network relationship within the same modality will not be destroyed, the original generalized fused lasso penalty was replaced with the fused pairwise group lasso (FGL) and the graph-guided pairwise group lasso (GGL) based on the method of joint sparse canonical correlation analysis (JSCCA). We used prior knowledge to construct a supervised bivariate learning model and use linear regression to select quantitative traits (QTs) of images that are strongly correlated with the Mini-mental State Examination (MMSE) scores. Compared with FGL-SCCA, the model we constructed obtained a higher gene-ROI correlation coefficient and identified more significant biomarkers, providing a theoretical basis for further understanding the complex pathology of neurodegenerative diseases.",34570360,,10.1007/s12031-021-01915-6,1
Cdk5 Inhibitory Peptide Prevents Loss of Neurons and Alleviates Behavioral Changes in p25 Transgenic Mice,"Background:Accumulation of p25 is thought to be a causative risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD). As a cleaved product of p35, p25 binds to cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5) and leads to the hyperactivity of Cdk5. Then, Cdk5/p25 phosphorylates many pathological substrates related to neurodegenerative diseases. p25 transgenic (Tg) mouse model recaptures some pathological changes of AD, including tau hyperphosphorylation, neurofibrillary tangles, neuroinflammation, and neuronal death, which can be prevented by transgenic expression of Cdk5 inhibitory peptide (CIP) before the insult of p25.Objective:In the present study, we would like to know whether adeno-associated virus serotype-9 (AAV9)-mediated CIP can protect neurons after insult of p25 in p25Tg mice.Methods:Administration of AAV9-CIP or control virus were delivered in the brain of p25Tg mice via intracerebroventricular infusions following the induction of p25. Western blotting, immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence assessment, and animal behavioral evaluation were performed.Results:Brain atrophy, neuronal death, tau phosphorylation and inflammation in the hippocampus, and cognitive decline were observed in p25Tg mice. Administration of CIP but not the control virus in p25Tg mice reduced levels of tau phosphorylation and inflammation in the hippocampus, which is correlated with inhibition of brain atrophy and neuronal apoptosis in the hippocampus, and improvement of cognitive decline.Conclusion:Our results provide further evidence that the neurotoxicity of p25 can be alleviated by CIP.",32144987,,10.3233/JAD-191098,8
The next step of neurogenesis in the context of Alzheimer's disease,"Among different pathological mechanisms, neuronal loss and neurogenesis impairment in the hippocampus play important roles in cognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease (AD). AD is a progressive and complex neurodegenerative diseases, which is very debilitating. The purpose of this paper is to review recent research into neurogenesis and AD and discuss how pharmacological drugs and herbal active components have impacts on neurogenesis and consequently improve cognitive functions. To date, despite huge research, no effective treatment has been approved for AD. Therefore, an avenue for future research and drug discovery is stimulating adult hippocampal neurogenesis (AHN). Evidence suggests that neurogenesis is regulated by the pharmacological treatment that may be recommended as a part of prophylaxis and therapeutic options for AD. However, the underlying mechanisms of regulating neurogenesis in AD are not well understood. To this point, we highlight to achieve an efficient treatment in AD by manipulating neurogenesis, it's necessary to target all steps of neurogenesis.",34232464,,10.1007/s11033-021-06520-9,4
Therapeutic considerations of bioactive compounds in Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease: Dissecting the molecular pathways,"Leading neurodegenerative diseases Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD) are characterized by the impairment of memory and motor functions, respectively. Despite several breakthroughs, there exists a lack of disease-modifying treatment strategies for these diseases, as the available drugs provide symptomatic relief and bring along side effects. Bioactive compounds are reported to bear neuroprotective properties with minimal toxicity, however, a detailed elucidation of their modes of neuroprotection is lacking. The review elucidates the neuroprotective mechanism(s) of some of the major phyto-compounds in pre-clinical and clinical studies of AD and PD to understand their potential in combating these diseases. Curcumin, eugenol, resveratrol, baicalein, sesamol and so on have proved efficient in countering the pathological hallmarks of AD and PD. Curcumin, resveratrol, caffeine and so on have reached the clinical phases of these diseases, while aromadendrin, delphinidin, cyanidin and xanthohumol are yet to be extensively explored in pre-clinical phases. The review highlights the need for extensive investigation of these compounds in the clinical stages of these diseases so as to utilize their disease-modifying abilities in the real field of treatment. Moreover, poor pharmacokinetic properties of natural compounds are constraints to their therapeutic yields and this review suggests a plausible contribution of nanotechnology in overcoming these limitations.",37823581,,10.1002/ptr.8012,0
microRNAs and Neurodegenerative Diseases,"microRNAs (miRNAs) are small, noncoding RNA molecules that through imperfect base-pairing with complementary sequences of target mRNA molecules, typically cleave target mRNA, causing subsequent degradation or translation inhibition. Although an increasing number of studies have identified misregulated miRNAs in the neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs) Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, which suggests that alterations in the miRNA regulatory pathway could contribute to disease pathogenesis, the molecular mechanisms underlying the pathological implications of misregulated miRNA expression and the regulation of the key genes involved in NDDs remain largely unknown. In this chapter, we provide evidence of the function and regulation of miRNAs and their association with the neurological events in NDDs. This will help improve our understanding of how miRNAs govern the biological functions of key pathogenic genes in these diseases, which potentially regulate several pathways involved in the progression of neurodegeneration. Additionally, given the growing interest in the therapeutic potential of miRNAs, we discuss current clinical challenges to developing miRNA-based therapeutics for NDDs.",26663180,,10.1007/978-3-319-22671-2_6,56
Angiotensin and neurovascular coupling: beyond hypertension,"Brain homeostasis is dependent upon the constant perfusion of oxygen and nutrients through CBF. The mechanism responsible to couple CBF to neuronal activity is termed NVC. Ang II, a key player in hypertension, impairs NVC and has been found to be of significant importance in neurodegenerative diseases, such as AD. The presence of Ang II and its metabolites, as well as their receptors have been detected in many areas of the brain. Findings indicate that disruption of NVC by Ang II is mediated by its AT1R and NADPH oxidase (NOX)-dependent ROS production independently of its effect on blood pressure. Although the process causing ROS to interfere with NVC has yet to be elucidated, data label peroxynitrite as the leading ROS to do so. The same common pathway is involved in NVC impairment in AD experimental models. This review investigates recent data concerning the effects of Ang II on NVC with the intent of exploring new treatment perspectives for neurodegenerative diseases such as AD.",25660297,,10.1111/micc.12193,17
"The genetic overlap between Alzheimer's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Lewy body dementia, and Parkinson's disease","Neurodegenerative diseases are a group of disorders characterized by neuronal cell death causing a variety of physical and mental problems. While these disorders can be characterized by their phenotypic presentation within the nervous system, their aetiologies differ to varying degrees. The majority of previous genetic evidence for overlap between neurodegenerative diseases has been pairwise. In this study, we aimed to identify overlap between the 4 investigated neurodegenerative disorders (Alzheimer's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Lewy body dementia, and Parkinson's disease) at the variant, gene, genomic locus, gene-set, cell, or tissue level, with specific interest in overlap between 3 or more diseases. Using local genetic correlation, we found 2 loci (TMEM175 and HLA) that were shared across 3 disorders. We also highlighted genes, genomic loci, gene sets, cell types, and tissue types which may be important to 2 or more disorders by analyzing the association of variants with a common factor estimated from the 4 disorders. Our study successfully highlighted genetic loci and tissues associated with 2 or more neurodegenerative diseases.",37045620,,10.1016/j.neurobiolaging.2023.03.004,1
Lactobacillaceae improve cognitive dysfunction via regulating gut microbiota and suppressing Aβ deposits and neuroinflammation in APP/PS1 mice,"Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most prevalent neurodegenerative disease, has a significant relationship with alteration of the gut microbiota (GM), and the GM-gut-brain axis has been explored to find novel therapeutic approaches for AD. The present study aimed to evaluate the effect of human Lactobacillaceae (HLL) on cognitive function in APP/PS1 mice. The results showed that HLL treatment significantly improved the cognitive function of mice via MWM and NOR tests. Furthermore, the expression of Aβ plaques, tau phosphorylation and neuroinflammation were markedly reduced in the hippocampus. Meanwhile, HLL treatment significantly increased the activity of GSH-PX and decreased the expression levels of IL-6 and MDA in the brain, and simultaneously increased the abundance of beneficial bacteria and restrained pathogenic bacteria in the intestine. Interestingly, significant correlations were observed between significant changes in abundance of GMs and AD-related markers. Collectively, these findings reveal that HLL is a promising therapeutic agent and potential probiotics, which might improve the cognitive function and AD pathologies.",36928985,,10.1007/s00203-023-03466-3,3
SAM-Support-Based Electrochemical Sensor for Aβ Biomarker Detection of Alzheimer's Disease,"Alzheimer's disease has taken the spotlight as a neurodegenerative disease which has caused crucial issues to both society and the economy. Specifically, aging populations in developed countries face an increasingly serious problem due to the increasing budget for patient care and an inadequate labor force, and therefore a solution is urgently needed. Recently, diverse techniques for the detection of Alzheimer's biomarkers have been researched and developed to support early diagnosis and treatment. Among them, electrochemical biosensors and electrode modification proved their effectiveness in the detection of the Aβ biomarker at appropriately low concentrations for practice and point-of-care application. This review discusses the production and detection ability of amyloid beta, an Alzheimer's biomarker, by electrochemical biosensors with SAM support for antibody conjugation. In addition, future perspectives on SAM for the improvement of electrochemical biosensors are also proposed and discussed.",37622895,PMC10452698,10.3390/bios13080809,1
Microtubule dynamics and the neurodegenerative triad of Alzheimer's disease: The hidden connection,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disorder and is, on a histopathological level, characterized by the presence of extracellular amyloid plaques composed of the protein fragment Aβ, and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles, which contain the microtubule-associated protein tau in a hyperphosphorylated state. In AD defects in microtubule (MT) assembly and organization have also been reported; however, it is unclear whether MT abnormalities have a causal and early role in the disease process or represent a common end point downstream of the neurodegenerative cascade. Recent evidence indicates that microtubule-stabilizing drugs prevent axonopathy in animal models of tauopathies and reverse Aβ-induced loss of synaptic connectivity in an ex vivo model of amyloidosis. This could suggest that MT dysfunction connects some of the degenerative events and provides a useful target to simultaneously prevent several neurodegenerative processes in AD. Here, we describe how changes in the structure and dynamics of MTs are involved in the different aspects of the neurodegenerative triad of AD. We discuss evidence that MTs are affected both by tau-dependent and tau-independent mechanisms but appear to be regulated in a distinct way in different neuronal compartments. We argue that modulation of MT dynamics could be of potential benefit but needs to be precisely controlled in a cell and compartment-specific manner to avoid harmful side effects. This article is part of the series ""Beyond Amyloid"".",28267200,,10.1111/jnc.14011,33
Mechanistic role of boswellic acids in Alzheimer's disease: Emphasis on anti-inflammatory properties,"The resin/gum of Boswellia species belonging to the family of Burseraceae is a naturally occurring mixture of bioactive compounds, which was traditionally used as a folk medicine to treat conditions like chronic inflammation. Several research studies have also explored its' therapeutic potential against multiple neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). The main chemical constituents of this gum include boswellic acids (BAs) like 3-O-acetyl-11-keto-β boswellic acid (AKBA) that possess potent anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective properties in AD. It is also involved in inhibiting the acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity in the cholinergic pathway and improve choline levels as well as its binding with nicotinic receptors to produce anti-inflammatory effects. Multiple shreds of evidence have demonstrated that BAs modulate key molecular targets and signalling pathways like 5-lipoxygenase/cyclooxygenase, Nrf2, NF-kB, cholinergic, amyloid-beta (Aβ), and neurofibrillary tangles formation (NFTs) that are involved in AD progression. The present review focuses on the possible mechanistic therapeutic role of BAs in modulating the 5-LOX/COX pathway in arachidonic acid metabolism, activating Nrf2 through binding of ARE, inhibiting NF-kB and AChE activity. In addition, an inhibition of amyloid plaques (Aβ) and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) induced neurotoxicity and neuroinflammation in AD by BAs is also discussed in this review. We have also highlighted that BAs possess beneficial effects in AD by targeting multiple molecular pathways and makes it an emerging drug candidate for treating neurodegenerative diseases.",34607104,,10.1016/j.biopha.2021.112250,13
Supramolecular organizing centers at the interface of inflammation and neurodegeneration,"The pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases involves the accumulation of misfolded protein aggregates. These deposits are both directly toxic to neurons, invoking loss of cell connectivity and cell death, and recognized by innate sensors that upon activation release neurotoxic cytokines, chemokines, and various reactive species. This neuroinflammation is propagated through signaling cascades where activated sensors/receptors, adaptors, and effectors associate into multiprotein complexes known as supramolecular organizing centers (SMOCs). This review provides a comprehensive overview of the SMOCs, involved in neuroinflammation and neurotoxicity, such as myddosomes, inflammasomes, and necrosomes, their assembly, and evidence for their involvement in common neurodegenerative diseases. We discuss the multifaceted role of neuroinflammation in the progression of neurodegeneration. Recent progress in the understanding of particular SMOC participation in common neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease offers novel therapeutic strategies for currently absent disease-modifying treatments.",35979366,PMC9377691,10.3389/fimmu.2022.940969,3
Physical Exercise-Induced Myokines in Neurodegenerative Diseases,"Neurodegenerative diseases (NDs), such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), Huntington's disease (HD), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), are disorders characterized by progressive degeneration of the nervous system. Currently, there is no disease-modifying treatments for most NDs. Meanwhile, numerous studies conducted on human and animal models over the past decades have showed that exercises had beneficial effects on NDs. Inter-tissue communication by myokine, a peptide produced and secreted by skeletal muscles during exercise, is thought to be an important underlying mechanism for the advantages. Here, we reviewed studies about the effects of myokines regulated by exercise on NDs and their mechanisms. Myokines could exert beneficial effects on NDs through a variety of regulatory mechanisms, including cell survival, neurogenesis, neuroinflammation, proteostasis, oxidative stress, and protein modification. Studies on exercise-induced myokines are expected to provide a novel strategy for treating NDs, for which there are no adequate treatments nowadays. To date, only a few myokines have been investigated for their effects on NDs and studies on mechanisms involved in them are in their infancy. Therefore, future studies are needed to discover more myokines and test their effects on NDs.",34071457,PMC8198301,10.3390/ijms22115795,20
Genome-wide association study and polygenic risk scores of retinal thickness across the cognitive continuum: data from the NORFACE cohort,"Background:Several studies have reported a relationship between retinal thickness and dementia. Therefore, optical coherence tomography (OCT) has been proposed as an early diagnosis method for Alzheimer's disease (AD). In this study, we performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) aimed at identifying genes associated with retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) and ganglion cell inner plexiform layer (GCIPL) thickness assessed by OCT and exploring the relationships between the spectrum of cognitive decline (including AD and non-AD cases) and retinal thickness.Methods:RNFL and GCIPL thickness at the macula were determined using two different OCT devices (Triton and Maestro). These determinations were tested for association with common single nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs) using adjusted linear regression models and combined using meta-analysis methods. Polygenic risk scores (PRSs) for retinal thickness and AD were generated.Results:Several genetic loci affecting retinal thickness were identified across the genome in accordance with previous reports. The genetic overlap between retinal thickness and dementia, however, was weak and limited to the GCIPL layer; only those observable with all-type dementia cases were considered.Conclusions:Our study does not support the existence of a genetic link between dementia and retinal thickness.",38365752,PMC10870444,10.1186/s13195-024-01398-8,0
Research Progress of Nanocarriers for the Treatment of Alzheimer's Disease,"Currently, many therapeutic drugs are difficult to cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB), making it difficult to reach the site of action and thus fail to achieve the desired efficacy. In recent years, researchers and drug designers have increasingly focused on nanotechnology to break through the difficulty of small molecule inhibitors to cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and improve the success rate of drug delivery to the central nervous system. Among the common central neurological diseases, such as encephalitis, Parkinson's, Alzheimer's disease, and epilepsy, Alzheimer's disease has attracted much attention from researchers. Alzheimer's disease is a specific neurodegenerative disease, which causes irreversible degeneration of neurons as well as synapses in the brain, resulting in memory and cognitive dysfunction, along with other psychiatric symptoms and behavioral disorders, which seriously affects people's everyday life. Moreover, nanotechnology has excellent potential for application in AD treatment. Studies have shown that nanocarriers can target the delivery of chemotherapeutic drugs, antioxidants, and other therapeutic substances to brain tissue using existing physiological mechanisms, thus effectively alleviating the disease progression of AD. Therefore, various nanoparticles and nanomedicine have been developed and constructed for diagnosing and treating AD in the past decades, such as nanoparticles, bionanoparticles, liposomes, nano-gel, dendrimers, and self-assembled nanoparticles. This study aims to review the applications and results of nanotechnology in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease in recent years and provide some ideas and clues for future research and development of more effective drug delivery systems.",36529920,,10.2174/1381612829666221216114912,0
Applications of Artificial Intelligence to Diagnosis of Neurodegenerative Diseases,"Artificial Intelligence (AI) is an umbrella term that represents a new technology for simulating and expanding human intelligence by using machines and computer systems. It consists of methods such as machine learning (ML), deep learning (DL), and natural language processing (NLP). In the era of big data, AI has emerged as an essential tool for improving the detection of neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's diseases (AD), Parkinson's diseases, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, etc. AI with its ability to extract critical information from the mass of data has enabled scientists to deal with various types of large-volume data, including genetic data, imaging data, and clinical data, rapidly generated in the course of neurodegenerative disease research. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the literature on current AI applications in the diagnosis of neurodegenerative diseases. Firstly, bioinformatics and AI approaches to identify potential biomarkers for neurodegenerative diseases such as AD are reviewed. Secondly, the use of ML and DL methods to analyze Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) data for a better understanding of disease progression and predicting patient outcomes is discussed. Finally, the use of AI methods including NLP for Electronic Health Record (EHR) data analysis to extract meaningful information and identify patterns that may contribute to early diagnosis and treatment planning are reviewed. The potential benefits of AI-based approaches in improving patient outcomes and the challenges associated with their implementations are also discussed. Overall, this paper highlights the promise of AI in transforming the diagnosis and management of neurodegenerative diseases.",38007795,,10.3233/SHTI230896,0
Glaucoma and Alzheimer Disease: One Age-Related Neurodegenerative Disease of the Brain,"Background:Open Angle Glaucoma (POAG) is the leading causes of irreversible blindness worldwide. Elevated intraocular pressure is considered an important risk factor for glaucoma; however, a subset of patients experiences a progression of the disease even in presence of normal intraocular pressure values. This implies that risk factors other than intraocular pressure are involved in the pathogenesis of glaucoma. A possible relationship between glaucoma and neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer Disease has been suggested. In this regard, we recently described a high prevalence of alterations typical of glaucoma, using Heidelberg Retinal Tomograph-3, in a group of patients with Alzheimer Disease. Interestingly, these alterations were not associated with elevated intraocular pressure or abnormal Central Corneal Thickness values. Alzheimer Disease is the most common form of dementia with progressive deterioration of memory and cognition. Complaints related to vision are common among Alzheimer Disease patients.Methods:In this paper researches related to glaucoma and Alzheimer disease are reviewed.Results:Diseases characteristics, i.e. common features, risk factors and pathophysiological mechanisms gathered in the recent literature do suggest that Alzheimer Disease and glaucoma can be considered both age-related neurodegenerative diseases that may co-exist in the elderly.Conclusion:In conclusion, preclinical and clinical evidence gathered so far support the notion that glaucoma is a widespread neurodegenerative condition whose common pathogenetic mechanisms with other diseases, i.e. Alzheimer Disease, should be further investigated as they may shed new light on these diseases improving both diagnosis and treatments.",29210654,PMC6120118,10.2174/1570159X16666171206144045,70
The neuropsychiatric profile of posterior cortical atrophy,"We analyzed scores obtained at the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) by 20 patients with posterior cortical atrophy (PCA) and contrasted it with 20 patients having Alzheimer disease (AD). Patients with hallucinations and delusions were not included due to the high probability of a diagnosis of Lewy body disease. Prevalence of behavioral and psychological symptoms (BPSD) was 95% in the PCA group, the most frequent being apathy and anxiety. Cluster analysis on NPI subscales highlighted a behavioral subsyndrome characterized by agitated temper and irritability. Depression, anxiety, and apathy did not cluster with any other BPSD nor with each other. The PCA group showed a significantly higher proportion of anxious patients and worse anxiety score than patients with AD. No correlation was found between NPI data and demographic, clinical, or neuropsychological features nor were there significant differences for the same variables between anxious and nonanxious cases with PCA. In agreement with anecdotal reports, anxiety seems particularly relevant in PCA.",25330926,,10.1177/0891988714554713,14
An insight into the neuroprotective effects and molecular targets of pomegranate (Punica granatum) against Alzheimer's disease,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease that still has no permanent cure. The drugs prescribed in the present days are only for symptomatic relief for the patients. Many studies correlating the reduction in the incidence of AD with the diet consumed have been published. These studies showed that a diet rich in polyphenols is associated with a decrease in the incidence of AD. The present review is focused on the ability of pomegranate and its bioactive components to ameliorate the progression of AD and their ability to exert a neuroprotective effect. Various studies showing the ability of pomegranate in inhibiting enzymes, reducing reactive oxygen species, inhibition of microglial activation, inhibition of tau protein hyperphosphorylation, maintenance of synaptic plasticity, anti-inflammatory activity and its ability to inhibit Beta secretase-1 (BACE-1) has been reviewed in this article. In spite of the lack of studies on humans, there are compelling evidence indicating that pomegranate can reduce various risk factors involved in the causation of AD and thus can be used as a persistent nutraceutical to slow ageing and for providing neuroprotection for the treatment of AD.HighlightsAn overview of traditional and pharmacological uses of pomegranate (POM).Potential of POM in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases especially in AD.Insight into the molecular mechanisms of neuroprotective effects of POM in AD.Clinical evaluation studies involving POM and its bioactive components.",36125072,,10.1080/1028415X.2022.2121092,5
Predictive Power of Cognitive Biomarkers in Neurodegenerative Disease Drug Development: Utility of the P300 Event-Related Potential,"Neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), and their associated deterioration of cognitive function are common causes of disability. The slowly developing pathology of neurodegenerative diseases necessitates early diagnosis and monitored long-term treatment. Lack of effective therapies coupled with an improved rate of early diagnosis in our aging population have created an urgent need for the development of novel drugs, as well as the need for reliable biomarkers for treatment response. These issues are especially relevant for AD, in which the rate of clinical trial drug failures has been very high. Frequently used biomarker evaluation procedures, such as positron emission tomography or cerebrospinal fluid measurements of phospho-tau and amyloid beta, are invasive and costly, and not universally available or accessible. This review considers the functionality of the event-related potential (ERP) P300 methodology as a surrogate biomarker for predicting the procognitive potential of drugs in clinical development for neurocognitive disorders. Through the application of standardized electroencephalography (EEG) described here, ERP P300 can be reliably measured. The P300 waveform objectively measures large-scale neuronal network functioning and working memory processes. Increased ERP P300 latency has been reported throughout the literature in disorders of cognition, supporting the potential utility of ERP P300 as a biomarker in many neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders, including AD. Specifically, evidence presented here supports ERP P300 latency as a quantitative, unbiased measure for detecting changes in cognition in patients with AD dementia through the progression from mild to moderate cognitive impairment and after drug treatment.",36398135,PMC9666049,10.1155/2022/2104880,7
Mitochondrial mechanisms in Alzheimer's disease: Quest for therapeutics,"Mitochondrial function is essential for maintaining neuronal integrity, because neurons have a high energy demand. Neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), are exacerbated by mitochondrial dysfunction. Mitochondrial autophagy (mitophagy) attenuates neurodegenerative diseases by eradicating dysfunctional mitochondria. In neurodegenerative disorders, there is disruption of the mitophagy process. High levels of iron also interfere with the mitophagy process and the mtDNA released after mitophagy is proinflammatory and triggers the cGAS-STING pathway that aids AD pathology. In this review, we critically discuss the factors that affect mitochondrial impairment and different mitophagy processes in AD. Furthermore, we discuss the molecules used in mouse studies as well as clinical trials that could result in potential therapeutics in the future.",36871845,,10.1016/j.drudis.2023.103547,3
Increasing the reproducibility of fluid biomarker studies in neurodegenerative studies,"Biomarkers have revolutionized scientific research on neurodegenerative diseases, in particular Alzheimer's disease, transformed drug trial design, and are also increasingly improving patient management in clinical practice. A few key cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers have been robustly associated with neurodegenerative diseases. Several novel biomarkers are very promising, especially blood-based markers. However, many biomarker findings have had low reproducibility despite initial promising results. In this perspective, we identify possible sources for low reproducibility of studies on fluid biomarkers for neurodegenerative diseases, with a focus on Alzheimer's disease. We suggest guidelines for researchers and journal editors, with the aim to improve reproducibility of findings.",33288742,PMC7721731,10.1038/s41467-020-19957-6,22
Unraveling the intercellular communication disruption and key pathways in Alzheimer's disease: an integrative study of single-nucleus transcriptomes and genetic association,"Background:Recently, single-nucleus RNA-seq (snRNA-seq) analyses have revealed important cellular and functional features of Alzheimer's disease (AD), a prevalent neurodegenerative disease. However, our knowledge regarding intercellular communication mediated by dysregulated ligand-receptor (LR) interactions remains very limited in AD brains.Methods:We systematically assessed the intercellular communication networks by using a discovery snRNA-seq dataset comprising 69,499 nuclei from 48 human postmortem prefrontal cortex (PFC) samples. We replicated the findings using an independent snRNA-seq dataset of 56,440 nuclei from 18 PFC samples. By integrating genetic signals from AD genome-wide association studies (GWAS) summary statistics and whole genome sequencing (WGS) data, we prioritized AD-associated Gene Ontology (GO) terms containing dysregulated LR interactions. We further explored drug repurposing for the prioritized LR pairs using the Therapeutic Targets Database.Results:We identified 190 dysregulated LR interactions across six major cell types in AD PFC, of which 107 pairs were replicated. Among the replicated LR signals, we found globally downregulated communications in the astrocytes-to-neurons signaling axis, characterized, for instance, by the downregulation of APOE-related and Calmodulin (CALM)-related LR interactions and their potential regulatory connections to target genes. Pathway analyses revealed 44 GO terms significantly linked to AD, highlighting Biological Processes such as 'amyloid precursor protein processing' and 'ion transmembrane transport,' among others. We prioritized several drug repurposing candidates, such as cromoglicate, targeting the identified dysregulated LR pairs.Conclusions:Our integrative analysis identified key dysregulated LR interactions in a cell type-specific manner and the associated GO terms in AD, offering novel insights into potential therapeutic targets involved in disrupted cell-cell communication in AD.",38167548,PMC10762817,10.1186/s13195-023-01372-w,0
The Big Bluff of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Diagnosis: The Role of Neurodegenerative Disease Mimics,"Neurodegenerative diseases include a significant number of pathologies affecting the nervous system. Generally, the primary cause of each disease is specific; however, recently, it was shown that they may be correlated at molecular level. This aspect, together with the exhibition of similar symptoms, renders the diagnosis of these disorders difficult. Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis is one of these pathologies. Herein, we report several cases of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis misdiagnosed as a consequence of features that are common to several neurodegenerative diseases, such as Parkinson's, Huntington's and Alzheimer's disease, spinal muscular atrophy, progressive bulbar palsy, spastic paraplegia and frontotemporal dementia, and mostly with the lysosomal storage disorder GM2 gangliosidosis. Overall reports highlight that the differential diagnosis for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis should include correlated mechanisms.",26227992,,10.1159/000435917,6
Resveratrol as a Natural Autophagy Regulator for Prevention and Treatment of Alzheimer's Disease,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is one of the most common neurodegenerative disorders over the age of 65 years old. Although several underlying mechanisms for explaining the pathogenesis of AD are elucidated, the effective supplements or drugs for the intervention of AD are still limited. Recently, impaired autophagy associated with miRNA dysfunction has been reported to involve in aging and aging-related neurodegenerative diseases. Thus, the activation of autophagy through effectively regulating miRNAs may become a potential target for the prevention or treatment of AD. Mounting evidence from in vitro and in vivo AD models has demonstrated that resveratrol, one of polyphenolic compounds, can exert neuroprotective role in neurodegenerative diseases especially AD. In this review, the regulation of miRNAs and autophagy using resveratrol during the prevention and treatment of AD are systematically discussed, which will be beneficial to establish a target for the direct link between pharmacological intervention and AD in the future.",28837083,PMC5622687,10.3390/nu9090927,56
The Relationship Between the Gut Microbiome and Neurodegenerative Diseases,"Many recent studies have shown that the gut microbiome plays important roles in human physiology and pathology. Also, microbiome-based therapies have been used to improve health status and treat diseases. In addition, aging and neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease, have become topics of intense interest in biomedical research. Several researchers have explored the links between these topics to study the potential pathogenic or therapeutic effects of intestinal microbiota in disease. But the exact relationship between neurodegenerative diseases and gut microbiota remains unclear. As technology advances, new techniques for studying the microbiome will be developed and refined, and the relationship between diseases and gut microbiota will be revealed. This article summarizes the known interactions between the gut microbiome and neurodegenerative diseases, highlighting assay techniques for the gut microbiome, and we also discuss the potential therapeutic role of microbiome-based therapies in diseases.",34216356,PMC8490573,10.1007/s12264-021-00730-8,34
Ameliorative Effects of Phytomedicines on Alzheimer's Patients,"Introduction:Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive, neurodegenerative disease that severely affects individuals' cognitive abilities, memory, and quality of life. It affects the elderly population, and there is no permanent prevention or cures available to date, treatments mainly aiming to alleviate the symptoms as and when they appear. Alternate therapeutic approaches are being researched constantly, and there is a growing focus on phytomedicine, herbal medicine, organic compounds, and ayurvedic compounds for the treatment of AD.Methods:The current study aims to provide an extensive review of these plants against AD from the currently existing literature. Most relevant keywords like Alzheimer's Disease, phytomedicines, ethnic medicines, the role of phytomedicine in neuroprotection, common phytomedicines against AD, etc., were used to select the plants and their metabolites effective in treating AD. The study focuses on six plants: Panax ginseng, Ginkgo biloba, Bacopa monnieri, Withania somnifera, Curcuma longa, and Lavandula angustifolia. Their active components have been studied along with neuroprotective properties, and evidence of in-vitro, pre-clinical, and clinical studies conducted to prove their therapeutic potential against the disease have been presented.Results:All plants envisaged in the study show potential for fighting against AD to varying degrees. Their compounds have shown therapeutic effects by reversing the neurological changes such as clearing Aβ plaque and neurofibrillary tangle formation, and ameliorative effects against neurodegeneration through processes including improving concentration, memory, cognition and learning, higher working and cue memory, improved spatial memory, inhibition of NF-κB expression, inhibiting the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, inhibition of AChE and lipid peroxidase enzymes, and reduction of interleukin levels and tumor necrosis factor-alpha.Conclusion:The present review is a comprehensive and up-to-date analysis supported by the evidentiary proofs from pre-clinical studies, meta-analyses, and review papers related to natural phytochemicals' impact on neurodegenerative disorders like AD.",35692129,,10.2174/1567205019666220610155608,2
Exploring the Potential of Aptamers in Targeting Neuroinflammation and Neurodegenerative Disorders: Opportunities and Challenges,"Neuroinflammation is the precursor for several neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs), such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), and multiple sclerosis (MS). Targeting neuroinflammation has emerged as a promising strategy to address a wide range of CNS pathologies. These NDDs still present significant challenges in terms of limited and ineffective diagnosis and treatment options, driving the need to explore innovative and novel therapeutic alternatives. Aptamers are single-stranded nucleic acids that offer the potential for addressing these challenges through diagnostic and therapeutic applications. In this review, we summarize diagnostic and therapeutic aptamers for inflammatory biomolecules, as well as the inflammatory cells in NDDs. We also discussed the potential of short nucleotides for Aptamer-Based Targeted Brain Delivery through their unique features and modifications, as well as their ability to penetrate the blood-brain barrier. Moreover, the unprecedented opportunities and substantial challenges of using aptamers as therapeutic agents, such as drug efficacy, safety considerations, and pharmacokinetics, are also discussed. Taken together, this review assesses the potential of aptamers as a pioneering approach for target delivery to the CNS and the treatment of neuroinflammation and NDDs.",37511539,PMC10380291,10.3390/ijms241411780,1
NOX-induced oxidative stress is a primary trigger of major neurodegenerative disorders,"Neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs) causing cognitive impairment and dementia are difficult to treat due to the lack of understanding of primary initiating factors. Meanwhile, major sporadic NDDs share many risk factors and exhibit similar pathologies in their early stages, indicating the existence of common initiation pathways. Glucose hypometabolism associated with oxidative stress is one such primary, early and shared pathology, and a likely major cause of detrimental disease-associated cascades; targeting this common pathology may therefore be an effective preventative strategy for most sporadic NDDs. However, its exact cause and trigger remain unclear. Recent research suggests that early oxidative stress caused by NADPH oxidase (NOX) activation is a shared initiating mechanism among major sporadic NDDs and could prove to be the long-sought ubiquitous NDD trigger. We focus on two major NDDs - Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD), as well as on acquired epilepsy which is an increasingly recognized comorbidity in NDDs. We also discuss available data suggesting the relevance of the proposed mechanisms to other NDDs. We delve into the commonalities among these NDDs in neuroinflammation and NOX involvement to identify potential therapeutic targets and gain a deeper understanding of the underlying causes of NDDs.",37838279,,10.1016/j.pneurobio.2023.102539,1
Endosomal Acid-Base Homeostasis in Neurodegenerative Diseases,"Neurodegenerative disorders are debilitating and largely untreatable conditions that pose a significant burden to affected individuals and caregivers. Overwhelming evidence supports a crucial preclinical role for endosomal dysfunction as an upstream pathogenic hub and driver in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and related neurodegenerative disorders. We present recent advances on the role of endosomal acid-base homeostasis in neurodegeneration and discuss evidence for converging mechanisms. The strongest genetic risk factor in sporadic AD is the ε4 allele of Apolipoprotein E (ApoE4), which potentiates pre-symptomatic endosomal dysfunction and prominent amyloid beta (Aβ) pathology, although how these pathways are linked mechanistically has remained unclear. There is emerging evidence that the Christianson syndrome protein NHE6 is a prominent ApoE4 effector linking endosomal function to Aβ pathologies. By functioning as a dominant leak pathway for protons, the Na+/H+exchanger activity of NHE6 limits endosomal acidification and regulates β-secretase (BACE)-mediated Aβ production and LRP1 receptor-mediated Aβ clearance. Pathological endosomal acidification may impact both Aβ generation and clearance mechanisms and emerges as a promising therapeutic target in AD. We also offer our perspective on the complex role of endosomal acid-base homeostasis in the pathogenesis of neurodegeneration and its therapeutic implications for neuronal rescue and repair strategies.",32737755,PMC7614123,10.1007/112_2020_25,3
Alzheimer's Precision Neurology: Epigenetics of Cytochrome P450 Genes in Circulating Cell-Free DNA for Disease Prediction and Mechanism,"Precision neurology combines high-throughput technologies and statistical modeling to identify novel disease pathways and predictive biomarkers in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Brain cytochrome P450 (CYP) genes are major regulators of cholesterol, sex hormone, and xenobiotic metabolism, and they could play important roles in neurodegenerative disorders. Increasing evidence suggests that epigenetic factors contribute to AD development. We evaluated cytosine ('CpG')-based DNA methylation changes in AD using circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA), to which neuronal cells are known to contribute. We investigated CYP-based mechanisms for AD pathogenesis and epigenetic biomarkers for disease detection. We performed a case-control study using 25 patients with AD and 23 cognitively healthy controls using the cfDNA of CYP genes. We performed a logistic regression analysis using the MetaboAnalyst software computer program and a molecular pathway analysis based on epigenetically altered CYP genes using the Cytoscape program. We identified 130 significantly (false discovery rate correction q-value < 0.05) differentially methylated CpG sites within the CYP genes. The top two differentially methylated genes identified wereCYP51A1andCYP2S1. The significant molecular pathways that were perturbed in AD cfDNA were (i) androgen and estrogen biosynthesis and metabolism, (ii) C21 steroid hormone biosynthesis and metabolism, and (iii) arachidonic acid metabolism. Existing evidence suggests a potential role of each of these biochemical pathways in AD pathogenesis. Next, we randomly divided the study group into discovery and validation sub-sets, each consisting of patients with AD and control patients. Regression models for AD prediction based on CYP CpG methylation markers were developed in the discovery or training group and tested in the independent validation group. The CYP biomarkers achieved a high predictive accuracy. After a 10-fold cross-validation, the combination of cg17852385/cg23101118 + cg14355428/cg22536554 achieved an AUC (95% CI) of 0.928 (0.787~1.00), with 100% sensitivity and 92.3% specificity for AD detection in the discovery group. The performance remained high in the independent validation or test group, achieving an AUC (95% CI) of 0.942 (0.905~0.979) with a 90% sensitivity and specificity. Our findings suggest that the epigenetic modification of CYP genes may play an important role in AD pathogenesis and that circulating CYP-based cfDNA biomarkers have the potential to accurately and non-invasively detect AD.",36769199,PMC9917756,10.3390/ijms24032876,1
Omics Data and Their Integrative Analysis to Support Stratified Medicine in Neurodegenerative Diseases,"Molecular and clinical heterogeneity is increasingly recognized as a common characteristic of neurodegenerative diseases (NDs), such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. This heterogeneity makes difficult the development of early diagnosis and effective treatment approaches, as well as the design and testing of new drugs. As such, the stratification of patients into meaningful disease subgroups, with clinical and biological relevance, may improve disease management and the development of effective treatments. To this end, omics technologies-such as genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics and metabolomics-are contributing to offer a more comprehensive view of molecular pathways underlying the development of NDs, helping to differentiate subtypes of patients based on their specific molecular signatures. In this article, we discuss how omics technologies and their integration have provided new insights into the molecular heterogeneity underlying the most prevalent NDs, aiding to define early diagnosis and progression markers as well as therapeutic targets that can translate into stratified treatment approaches, bringing us closer to the goal of personalized medicine in neurology.",34062930,PMC8125201,10.3390/ijms22094820,10
[Mitochondrial genome variants and neurodegenerative diseases],"Neurodegenerative diseases are a group of diseases characterized by chronic progressive damage to tissues of central nervous system and peripheral nervous system, which include Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, frontotemporal dementia, etc. The etiology is mainly related to factors such as aging, genetics and environment. More and more evidence indicate that mitochondrial dysfunction plays a vital role in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases. Variants of mitochondrial genes, including point variants, deletions, and copy number variations, have been recognized as important factors modulating genetic susceptibility to such diseases. This paper has reviewed recent studies for the influence of mitochondrial variants on the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases, in order to provide clues for the pathogenesis, diagnosis and development of new drugs for such disorders.",32761605,,10.3760/cma.j.issn.1003-9406.2020.08.023,0
Quantitative detection of grey and white matter amyloid pathology using a combination of K114 and CRANAD-3 fluorescence,"Background:Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease that exacts a huge toll on the patient, the healthcare system and society in general. Abundance and morphology of protein aggregates such as amyloid β plaques and tau tangles, along with cortical atrophy and gliosis are used as measures to assess the changes in the brain induced by the disease. Not all of these parameters have a direct correlation with cognitive decline. Studies have shown that only particular protein conformers can be the main drivers of disease progression, and conventional approaches are unable to distinguish different conformations of disease-relevant proteins.Methods and results:Using the fluorescent amyloid probes K114 and CRANAD-3 and spectral confocal microscopy, we examined formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded brain samples from different control and AD cases. Based on the emission spectra of the probes used in this study, we found that certain spectral signatures can be correlated with different aggregates formed by different proteins. The combination of spectral imaging and advanced image analysis tools allowed us to detect variability of protein deposits across the samples.Conclusion:Our proposed method offers a quicker and easier neuropathological assessment of tissue samples, as well as introducing an additional parameter by which protein aggregates can be discriminated.",34751140,,10.1016/j.nbd.2021.105540,5
Artificial intelligence-coupled plasmonic infrared sensor for detection of structural protein biomarkers in neurodegenerative diseases,"Diagnosis of neurodegenerative disorders (NDDs) including Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease is challenging owing to the lack of tools to detect preclinical biomarkers. The misfolding of proteins into oligomeric and fibrillar aggregates plays an important role in the development and progression of NDDs, thus underscoring the need for structural biomarker-based diagnostics. We developed an immunoassay-coupled nanoplasmonic infrared metasurface sensor that detects proteins linked to NDDs, such as alpha-synuclein, with specificity and differentiates the distinct structural species using their unique absorption signatures. We augmented the sensor with an artificial neural network enabling unprecedented quantitative prediction of oligomeric and fibrillar protein aggregates in their mixture. The microfluidic integrated sensor can retrieve time-resolved absorbance fingerprints in the presence of a complex biomatrix and is capable of multiplexing for the simultaneous monitoring of multiple pathology-associated biomarkers. Thus, our sensor is a promising candidate for the clinical diagnosis of NDDs, disease monitoring, and evaluation of novel therapies.",37436975,PMC10337894,10.1126/sciadv.adg9644,2
Clinical advances in analytical profiling of signature lipids: implications for severe non-communicable and neurodegenerative diseases,"Background:Lipids play key roles in numerous biological processes, including energy storage, cell membrane structure, signaling, immune responses, and homeostasis, making lipidomics a vital branch of metabolomics that analyzes and characterizes a wide range of lipid classes. Addressing the complex etiology, age-related risk, progression, inflammation, and research overlap in conditions like Alzheimer's Disease, Parkinson's Disease, Cardiovascular Diseases, and Cancer poses significant challenges in the quest for effective therapeutic targets, improved diagnostic markers, and advanced treatments. Mass spectrometry is an indispensable tool in clinical lipidomics, delivering quantitative and structural lipid data, and its integration with technologies like Liquid Chromatography (LC), Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), and few emerging Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption Ionization- Imaging Mass Spectrometry (MALDI-IMS) along with its incorporation into Tissue Microarray (TMA) represents current advances. These innovations enhance lipidomics assessment, bolster accuracy, and offer insights into lipid subcellular localization, dynamics, and functional roles in disease contexts.Aim of the review:The review article summarizes recent advancements in lipidomic methodologies from 2019 to 2023 for diagnosing major neurodegenerative diseases, Alzheimer's and Parkinson's, serious non-communicable cardiovascular diseases and cancer, emphasizing the role of lipid level variations, and highlighting the potential of lipidomics data integration with genomics and proteomics to improve disease understanding and innovative prognostic, diagnostic and therapeutic strategies.Key scientific concepts of review:Clinical lipidomic studies are a promising approach to track and analyze lipid profiles, revealing their crucial roles in various diseases. This lipid-focused research provides insights into disease mechanisms, biomarker identification, and potential therapeutic targets, advancing our understanding and management of conditions such as Alzheimer's Disease, Parkinson's Disease, Cardiovascular Diseases, and specific cancers.",38459207,,10.1007/s11306-024-02100-7,0
A greater focus on metals in biomedicine and neuroscience is needed,"Metals have many essential functions in the brain and a large body of evidence supports important roles for altered metal stasis in many brain disorders. However, despite this evidence, acceptance of metals as key mediators of brain dysfunction is largely lacking in mainstream biomedicine. This editorial will outline the possible reasons for this and suggest potential means to improve the acceptance of metals as central players in brain disease.",27814741,PMC5097404,10.1186/s40360-016-0095-4,2
Diagnostic function of the neuroinflammatory biomarker YKL-40 in Alzheimer's disease and other neurodegenerative diseases,"Neuroinflammation is a crucial mechanism in the pathophysiology of neurodegenerative diseases pathophysiology. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) YKL-40 - an indicator of microglial activation - has recently been identified by proteomic studies as a candidate biomarker for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Areas covered: We review the impact of CSF YKL-40 as a pathophysiological biomarker for AD and other neurodegenerative diseases. CSF YKL-40 concentrations have been shown to predict progression from prodromal mild cognitive impairment to AD dementia. Moreover, a positive association between CSF YKL-40 and other biomarkers of neurodegeneration - particularly total tau protein - has been reported during the asymptomatic preclinical stage of AD and other neurodegenerative diseases. Albeit preliminary, current data do not support an association between APOE-ε4 status and CSF YKL-40 concentrations. When interpreting the diagnostic/prognostic significance of CSF YKL-40 concentrations in neurodegenerative diseases, potential confounders - including age, metabolic and cardiovascular risk factors, diagnostic criteria for selecting cases/controls - need to be considered. Expert opinion/commentary: CSF YKL-40 represents a pathophysiological biomarker reflecting immune/inflammatory mechanisms in neurodegenerative diseases, associated with tau protein pathology. Besides being associated with tau pathology, CSF YKL-40 adds to the growing array of biomarkers reflecting distinct molecular brain mechanisms potentially useful for stratifying individuals for biomarker-guided, targeted anti-inflammatory therapies emerging from precision medicine.",28281838,,10.1080/14789450.2017.1304217,40
Neuroepigenetic Mechanisms of Action of Ultrashort Peptides in Alzheimer's Disease,"Epigenetic regulation of gene expression is necessary for maintaining higher-order cognitive functions (learning and memory). The current understanding of the role of epigenetics in the mechanism of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is focused on DNA methylation, chromatin remodeling, histone modifications, and regulation of non-coding RNAs. The pathogenetic links of this disease are the misfolding and aggregation of tau protein and amyloid peptides, mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, impaired energy metabolism, destruction of the blood-brain barrier, and neuroinflammation, all of which lead to impaired synaptic plasticity and memory loss. Ultrashort peptides are promising neuroprotective compounds with a broad spectrum of activity and without reported side effects. The main aim of this review is to analyze the possible epigenetic mechanisms of the neuroprotective action of ultrashort peptides in AD. The review highlights the role of short peptides in the AD pathophysiology. We formulate the hypothesis that peptide regulation of gene expression can be mediated by the interaction of short peptides with histone proteins, cis- and transregulatory DNA elements and effector molecules (DNA/RNA-binding proteins and non-coding RNA). The development of therapeutic agents based on ultrashort peptides may offer a promising addition to the multifunctional treatment of AD.",35457077,PMC9032300,10.3390/ijms23084259,5
"Benzenesulfonamide as a novel, pharmaceutical small molecule inhibitor on Aβ gene expression and oxidative stress in Alzheimer's Wistar rats","Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prevalent acute neurodegenerative disease described by memory loss and other cognitive functions. Benzenesulfonamide, a novel, potent, and small organic molecule, was synthesized to investigate its effects on the levels of oxidative biomarkers (GPx, ROS, and MDA) and expression of beta-amyloid peptides (Aβ40 and Aβ42) in the pathology of AD. The results were compared with the rivastigmine drug. Applying benzenesulfonamide to Alzheimer's-induced Wistar rats showed a significant increase in the level of oxidative biomarkers (GPx, ROS, and MDA) in both the brain and blood serum as well as amyloid-β40 and 42 gene expressions. Therefore, benzenesulfonamide could be considered a novel therapeutic agent against AD.",37421923,,10.1016/j.bbrc.2023.06.063,0
Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases: Focus on mild cognitive impairment,"The mild cognitive impairment (MCI) concept was developed to identify the earliest stages of cognitive impairment. MCI and, more specifically, amnestic MCI were initially proposed as transitional states that ultimately progress to full blown Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, MCI subjects do not uniformly progress to dementia (either AD or another) and may revert back to normal cognitive state. The MCI as concept has been borrowed from AD to other neurodegenerative diseases, particularly Parkinson's disease (PD). However the operational definition of MCI may not adequately convey the intended concept. Additional modifications to the concept and its operationalization are needed in order to better identify patients with incipient cognitive impairment and to guide clinical and research practices. Patients with PD have a very high likelihood of developing dementia, insidiously over many years. Cognitive impairment may start even before other symptoms. No constellation of cognitive symptoms in an otherwise healthy individual will herald development of AD or indeed will progress to dementia, including PD-dementia, in high likelihood. At present, identification of subtle cognitive dysfunction even in a person with diagnosed PD does not benefit the patient and should be avoided, except for research purposes.",26516060,,10.1016/j.parkreldis.2015.09.053,7
Interconnection between brain and retinal neurodegenerations,"The eye is a special sensory organ, which is basically an extension of the brain. Both are derived from neural tube and consist of neurons. Therefore, diseases of both the brain and eye should have some similarity. Neurodegenerative disorders like Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the major cause of dementia in the world. Amyloid deposition in the cerebral cortex and hippocampal region is the basic pathology in AD. But along with it, there are various changes that take place in the eye, i.e., abnormal pupillary reaction, decreased vision, decreased contrast sensitivity, visual field changes, loss of retinal ganglionic cells and retinal fiber layer, peripapillary atrophy, increased cup-disk ratio, retinal thinning, tortuosity of blood vessels, and deposition of Aβ-like substance in the retina. And these changes are present in the early part of the disease when only mild cognitive impairment is there. As the brain is covered by a hard bony skull which makes it difficult to directly visualize the changes occurring in the brain at molecular levels, finer details of disease progression are not available with us. But the eye is the window of the brain; with advanced modern techniques, we can directly visualize the changes in the retina at a very fine level. Therefore, by depicting neurodegenerative changes in the eye, we can diagnose and manage AD at very early stages. Along with it, retinal neurodegenerations like glaucoma and age-related macular degeneration (ARMD) are the major cause of loss of vision, and still, there are no effective treatment modalities for these blinding conditions. So if we can understand its pathogenesis and progression by correlating with brain neurodegenerations, we can come up with a better therapy for glaucoma and ARMD.",24826919,,10.1007/s12035-014-8733-6,30
Quantifying mechanisms in neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs) using candidate mechanism perturbation amplitude (CMPA) algorithm,"Background:Literature derived knowledge assemblies have been used as an effective way of representing biological phenomenon and understanding disease etiology in systems biology. These include canonical pathway databases such as KEGG, Reactome and WikiPathways and disease specific network inventories such as causal biological networks database, PD map and NeuroMMSig. The represented knowledge in these resources delineates qualitative information focusing mainly on the causal relationships between biological entities. Genes, the major constituents of knowledge representations, tend to express differentially in different conditions such as cell types, brain regions and disease stages. A classical approach of interpreting a knowledge assembly is to explore gene expression patterns of the individual genes. However, an approach that enables quantification of the overall impact of differentially expressed genes in the corresponding network is still lacking.Results:Using the concept of heat diffusion, we have devised an algorithm that is able to calculate the magnitude of regulation of a biological network using expression datasets. We have demonstrated that molecular mechanisms specific to Alzheimer (AD) and Parkinson Disease (PD) regulate with different intensities across spatial and temporal resolutions. Our approach depicts that the mitochondrial dysfunction in PD is severe in cortex and advanced stages of PD patients. Similarly, we have shown that the intensity of aggregation of neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) in AD increases as the disease progresses. This finding is in concordance with previous studies that explain the burden of NFTs in stages of AD.Conclusions:This study is one of the first attempts that enable quantification of mechanisms represented as biological networks. We have been able to quantify the magnitude of regulation of a biological network and illustrate that the magnitudes are different across spatial and temporal resolution.",31604427,PMC6788110,10.1186/s12859-019-3101-1,3
Using blood transcriptome analysis for Alzheimer's disease diagnosis and patient stratification,"Introduction:Blood protein biomarkers demonstrate potential for Alzheimer's disease (AD) diagnosis. Limited studies examine the molecular changes in AD blood cells.Methods:Bulk RNA-sequencing of blood cells was performed on AD patients of Chinese descent (n = 214 and 26 in the discovery and validation cohorts, respectively) with normal controls (n = 208 and 38 in the discovery and validation cohorts, respectively). Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) and deconvolution analysis identified AD-associated gene modules and blood cell types. Regression and unsupervised clustering analysis identified AD-associated genes, gene modules, cell types, and established AD classification models.Results:WGCNA on differentially expressed genes revealed 15 gene modules, with 6 accurately classifying AD (areas under the receiver operating characteristics curve [auROCs] > 0.90). These modules stratified AD patients into subgroups with distinct disease states. Cell-type deconvolution analysis identified specific blood cell types potentially associated with AD pathogenesis.Discussion:This study highlights the potential of blood transcriptome for AD diagnosis, patient stratification, and mechanistic studies.Highlights:We comprehensively analyze the blood transcriptomes of a well-characterized Alzheimer's disease cohort to identify genes, gene modules, pathways, and specific blood cells associated with the disease. Blood transcriptome analysis accurately classifies and stratifies patients with Alzheimer's disease, with some gene modules achieving classification accuracy comparable to that of the plasma ATN biomarkers. Immune-associated pathways and immune cells, such as neutrophils, have potential roles in the pathogenesis and progression of Alzheimer's disease.",38323937,PMC11032555,10.1002/alz.13691,0
Dissecting the Relationship Between Neuropsychiatric and Neurodegenerative Disorders,"Neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs) and neuropsychiatric disorders (NPDs) are two common causes of death in elderly people, which includes progressive neuronal cell death and behavioral changes. NDDs include Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, multiple sclerosis, and motor neuron disease, characterized by cognitive defects and memory impairment, whereas NPDs include depression, seizures, migraine headaches, eating disorders, addictions, palsies, major depressive disorders, anxiety, and schizophrenia, characterized by behavioral changes. Mounting evidence demonstrated that NDDs and NPDs share an overlapping mechanism, which includes post-translational modifications, the microbiota-gut-brain axis, and signaling events. Mounting evidence demonstrated that various drug molecules, namely, natural compounds, repurposed drugs, multitarget directed ligands, and RNAs, have been potentially implemented as therapeutic agents against NDDs and NPDs. Herein, we highlighted the overlapping mechanism, the role of anxiety/stress-releasing factors, cytosol-to-nucleus signaling, and the microbiota-gut-brain axis in the pathophysiology of NDDs and NPDs. We summarize the therapeutic application of natural compounds, repurposed drugs, and multitarget-directed ligands as therapeutic agents. Lastly, we briefly described the application of RNA interferences as therapeutic agents in the pathogenesis of NDDs and NPDs. Neurodegenerative diseases and neuropsychiatric diseases both share a common signaling molecule and molecular phenomenon, namely, pro-inflammatory cytokines, γCaMKII and MAPK/ERK, chemokine receptors, BBB permeability, and the gut-microbiota-brain axis. Studies have demonstrated that any alterations in the signaling mentioned above molecules and molecular phenomena lead to the pathophysiology of neurodegenerative diseases, namely, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and neuropsychiatric disorders, such as bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, depression, anxiety, autism spectrum disorder, and post-traumatic stress disorder.",37458987,,10.1007/s12035-023-03502-9,6
"Relationship Between Obesity, Alzheimer's Disease, and Parkinson's Disease: an Astrocentric View","Obesity is considered one of the greatest risk to human health and is associated with several factors including genetic components, diet, and physical inactivity. Recently, the relationship between obesity and numerous progressive and aging-related neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's disease (PD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) have been observed. Thus, the involvement of the most abundant and heterogeneous group of glial cells in neurodegenerative diseases, the astrocytes, is caused by a combination of the failure on their normal homeostatic functions and the increase of toxic metabolites upon pathological event. Upon brain damage, molecular signals induce astrocyte activation and migration to the site of injury, entering in a highly active state, with the aim to contribute to ameliorating or worsening the pathology. In this regard, the aim of this review is to elucidate the relationship between obesity, Alzheimer's disease, and Parkinson's disease and highlight the role of astrocytes in these pathologies.",27796748,,10.1007/s12035-016-0193-8,29
A Case of Possible Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy and Alzheimer's Disease in an Ex-Football Player,"Introduction:Chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) is a debilitating neurodegenerative disease, which is often the sequelae of repetitive head trauma. Although the definitive diagnosis of CTE is made postmortem, there are proposed clinical algorithms aimed at identifying characteristic features of CTE, based on a combination of clinical history, serum, cerebrospinal fluid and neuroimaging biomarkers. There are promising new advances in positron emission tomography neuroimaging, including tau specific ligands, which will potentially provide a robust assessment as well as an exploratory tool of the disease semiology and progression.Case report:Here is a unique case of an ex-football player, who suffered multiple prior traumatic brain injuries throughout his career, and presented to our clinic with significant episodic memory, visuospatial and executive functioning deficits, as well as comorbid mood and behavioral changes in the absence of prior psychiatric history or substance use. His clinical presentation and biomarkers were consistent with a suspected diagnosis of CTE comorbid with Alzheimer disease, which comprises a significant portion of overall CTE cases.Conclusion:This case report presents a patient with a subtle case of dementia, which could be easily mistaken for behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia or primary progressive aphasia. This in turn highlights the importance of detailed longitudinal history taking, as well as rigorous biomarker studies.",34879014,PMC9439689,10.1097/NRL.0000000000000391,1
Common Factors in Neurodegeneration: A Meta-Study Revealing Shared Patterns on a Multi-Omics Scale,"Neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), Huntington's disease (HD), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) are heterogeneous, progressive diseases with frequently overlapping symptoms characterized by a loss of neurons. Studies have suggested relations between neurodegenerative diseases for many years (e.g., regarding the aggregation of toxic proteins or triggering endogenous cell death pathways). We gathered publicly available genomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic data from 177 studies and more than one million patients to detect shared genetic patterns between the neurodegenerative diseases on three analyzed omics-layers. The results show a remarkably high number of shared differentially expressed genes between the transcriptomic and proteomic levels for all conditions, while showing a significant relation between genomic and proteomic data between AD and PD and AD and ALS. We identified a set of 139 genes being differentially expressed in several transcriptomic experiments of all four diseases. These 139 genes showed overrepresented gene ontology (GO) Terms involved in the development of neurodegeneration, such as response to heat and hypoxia, positive regulation of cytokines and angiogenesis, and RNA catabolic process. Furthermore, the four analyzed neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs) were clustered by their mean direction of regulation throughout all transcriptomic studies for this set of 139 genes, with the closest relation regarding this common gene set seen between AD and HD. GO-Term and pathway analysis of the proteomic overlap led to biological processes (BPs), related to protein folding and humoral immune response. Taken together, we could confirm the existence of many relations between Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis on transcriptomic and proteomic levels by analyzing the pathways and GO-Terms arising in these intersections. The significance of the connection and the striking relation of the results to processes leading to neurodegeneration between the transcriptomic and proteomic data for all four analyzed neurodegenerative diseases showed that exploring many studies simultaneously, including multiple omics-layers of different neurodegenerative diseases simultaneously, holds new relevant insights that do not emerge from analyzing these data separately. Furthermore, the results shed light on processes like the humoral immune response that have previously been described only for certain diseases. Our data therefore suggest human patients with neurodegenerative diseases should be addressed as complex biological systems by integrating multiple underlying data sources.",33302607,PMC7764447,10.3390/cells9122642,21
Influence of Commensal Microbiota on the Enteric Nervous System and Its Role in Neurodegenerative Diseases,"When thinking about neurodegenerative diseases, the first symptoms that come to mind are loss of memory and learning capabilities, which all resemble hallmarks of manifestation of such diseases in the central nervous system (CNS). However, the gut comprises the largest nervous system outside the CNS that is autonomously active and in close interplay with its microbiota. Therefore, the enteric nervous system (ENS) might serve as an indicator of degenerative pathomechanisms that also affect the CNS. On the other hand, it might offer an entry point for devastating influences from the microbial community or - conversely - for therapeutic approaches via gut commensals. Within the last years, the ENS and gut microbiota therefore have sparked the interest of researchers of CNS diseases and we here report on recent findings and open questions, especially with regard to Alzheimer and Parkinson diseases.",29742516,PMC6757170,10.1159/000488629,29
Analysis of tauopathy research funding between 2006 and 2016 reveals critical gaps in research priorities,"Neurodegenerative diseases encompass a range of diagnoses, such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. Despite decades of advancements in understanding the neurobiology of individual diseases, this class has few disease-modifying therapeutics and a paucity of biomarkers for diagnosis or progression. However, tau protein aggregation has emerged as a potential unifying factor across several neurodegenerative diseases, which has prompted a rapid growth in tau-related funding. In spite of this growth, research funding in this area is not in line with the immense magnitude of disease burden, and drug discovery and clinical research remain underfunded. Coordinated, collaborative efforts are key to making an impact, which can and should be led by the major funding bodies within the tau space. Here we describe the development and analysis of a tau-focused neurodegeneration funding database, which captures data from 2040 grants from 2006 to 2016. This database was developed as a public resource to allow funders, researchers, and policy makers to better understand tau funding patterns and to identify key funders and potential collaborations. This database can be used in conjunction with other neurodegenerative disease databases, such as the International Alzheimer's Disease Research Portfolio to gain specific insight into tau-research funding. Over the study period, overall tau funding rose dramatically; however, changes in capital distribution also changed. Specifically, the field experienced a strong bias toward funding tau in the context of Alzheimer's disease, while at the same time generally decreasing the overall proportion of funding for basic research, treatment development, and evaluation. As funding organizations look forward, this resource can both inform future funding strategies and priority areas and identify potential collaborative efforts with complementary funding organizations.",30314799,,10.1016/j.jalz.2018.07.218,1
Tau seeds occur before earliest Alzheimer's changes and are prevalent across neurodegenerative diseases,"Tau neurofibrillary tangles are a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease neuropathological change. However, it remains largely unclear how distinctive Alzheimer's disease tau seeds (i.e. 3R/4R) correlate with histological indicators of tau accumulation. Furthermore, AD tau co-pathology is thought to influence features and progression of other neurodegenerative diseases including Lewy body disease; yet measurements of different types of tau seeds in the setting of such diseases is an unmet need. Here, we use tau real-time quaking-induced conversion (RT-QuIC) assays to selectively quantitate 3R/4R tau seeds in the frontal lobe which accumulates histologically identifiable tau pathology at late disease stages of AD neuropathologic change. Seed quantitation across a spectrum of neurodegenerative disease cases and controls indicated tau seeding activity can be detected well before accompanying histopathological indication of tau deposits, and even prior to the earliest evidence of Alzheimer's-related tau accumulation anywhere in the brain. In later stages of AD, 3R/4R tau RT-QuIC measures correlated with immunohistochemical tau burden. In addition, Alzheimer's tau seeds occur in the vast majority of cases evaluated here inclusive of primary synucleinopathies, frontotemporal lobar degeneration and even controls albeit at multi-log lower levels than Alzheimer's cases. α-synuclein seeding activity confirmed synucleinopathy cases and further indicated the co-occurrence of α-synuclein seeds in some Alzheimer's disease and primary tauopathy cases. Our analysis indicates that 3R/4R tau seeds in the mid-frontal lobe correlate with the overall Braak stage and Alzheimer's disease neuropathologic change, supporting the quantitative predictive value of tau RT-QuIC assays. Our data also indicate 3R/4R tau seeds are elevated in females compared to males at high (≥ IV) Braak stages. This study suggests 3R/4R tau seeds are widespread even prior to the earliest stages of Alzheimer's disease changes, including in normal, and even young individuals, with prevalence across multiple neurodegenerative diseases to further define disease subtypes.",37154939,PMC10261243,10.1007/s00401-023-02574-0,4
Salivary Biomarkers for Alzheimer's Disease: A Systematic Review with Meta-Analysis,"Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disease which manifests with progressive cognitive impairment, leading to dementia. Considering the noninvasive collection of saliva, we designed the systematic review to answer the question ""Are salivary biomarkers reliable for the diagnosis of Alzheimer's Disease?"" Following the inclusion and exclusion criteria, 30 studies were included in this systematic review (according to the PRISMA statement guidelines). Potential biomarkers include mainly proteins, metabolites and even miRNAs. Based on meta-analysis, in AD patients, salivary levels of beta-amyloid42 and p-tau levels were significantly increased, and t-tau and lactoferrin were decreased at borderline statistical significance. However, according to pooled AUC, lactoferrin and beta-amyloid42 showed a significant predictive value for salivary-based AD diagnosis. In conclusion, potential markers such as beta-amyloid42, tau and lactoferrin can be detected in the saliva of AD patients, which could reliably support the early diagnosis of this neurodegenerative disease.",38256241,PMC10817083,10.3390/ijms25021168,3
Lipid Biomarkers in Alzheimer's Disease,"Background:There are now significant evidences that lipid metabolism is affected in numerous neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's disease. These dysfunctions lead to abnormal levels of certain lipids in the brain, cerebrospinal fluid and plasma. It is consequently of interest to establish lipid profiles in neurodegenerative diseases. This approach, which can contribute to identify lipid biomarkers of Alzheimers' disease, can also permit to identify new therapeutic targets. It was therefore of interest to focus on central and peripheral biomarkers in Alzheimer's disease.Methods:A review of the literature on 148 papers was conducted. Based on this literature, the involvement of lipids (cholesterol and oxysterols, fatty acids, phospholipids) in Alzheimer's disease has been proposed.Results:Of the 148 references cited for lipid biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease, 65 refer to cholesterol and oxysterols, 35 to fatty acids and 40 to phospholipids. Among these lipids, some of them such as 24S-hydroxyckolesterol, open up new therapeutic perspectives in gene therapy, in particular. The results on the very long-chain fatty acids suggest the potential of peroxisomal dysfunctions in Alzheimer's disease. As for the phospholipids, they could constitute interesting biomarkers for detecting the disease at the prodromal stage.Conclusion:There are now several lines of evidence that lipids play fundamental roles in the pathogenesis of AD and that some of them have a prognostic and diagnosis value. This may pave the way for the identification of new therapeutic targets, new effective drugs and / or new treatments.",28474568,,10.2174/1567205014666170505101426,57
Psychotropic Drug Development Strategies that Target Neuropsychiatric Etiologies in Alzheimer's and Parkinson's Diseases,"Preclinical Research Neuropsychiatric symptoms are currently recognized as a common burden in patients suffering from Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), and many other neurodegenerative disorders. Earlier theories positing that these symptoms emerge predominantly in patients with late-stage disease have been largely dismissed. It is now generally accepted that many neuropsychiatric symptoms commonly manifest very early in neurodegenerative disease stages, and in many cases are even considered prodromal indicators. Despite intense research efforts, no reliable drug treatment strategies have been found for the neuropsychiatric symptoms associated with AD and PD. Among the medications commonly used at this stage, many present significant risks for patients in this particular cohort. Transcriptomic tools and proteomic profiling have clearly indicated that neurodegenerative diseases and their associated neuropsychiatric comorbidities are multifactorial in origin. As such, multiple-and in many cases divergent-disease etiologies lead to the neuropsychiatric symptoms associated with AD, PD, and other neurodegenerative disorders. The complexity of these pathways (initiated by a cascade of molecular events that involve several neurotransmitter systems) offer significant challenges to drug discovery efforts aimed at addressing these symptoms. In response to this complexity, a new paradigm has emerged that challenges the widely held assumption that ""targeted"" drug design is superior to the development of ""multi-targeted"" drugs as a strategy to address the neuropsychiatric symptoms associated with AD and PD. In this Overview, I offer an overview of drug discovery strategies and investigative drugs currently under development that address multiple CNS etiological targets associated with an array of neuropsychiatric symptoms.

Strategic Design of Amyloid-β Species Fluorescent Probes for Alzheimer's Disease,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a high mortality and high disability rates neurodegenerative disease characterized by irreversible progression and poses a significant social and economic burden throughout the world. However, currently approved AD therapeutic agents only alleviate symptoms and there is still a lack of practical therapeutic regimens to stop or slow the progression of this disease. Thus, there is urgently needed novel diagnosis tools and drugs for early diagnosis and treatment of AD. Among several AD pathological hallmarks, amyloid-β (Aβ) peptide deposition is considered a critical initiating factor in AD. In recent years, with the advantages of excellent sensitivity and high resolution, near-infrared fluorescence (NIRF) imaging has attracted the attention of many researchers to develop Aβ plaque probes. This review mainly focused on different NIRF probe design strategies for imaging Aβ species to pave the way for the future design of novel NIRF probes for early diagnosis AD.",35132849,,10.1021/acschemneuro.1c00810,11
A review of brain imaging biomarker genomics in Alzheimer's disease: implementation and perspectives,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease with phenotypic changes closely associated with both genetic variants and imaging pathology. Brain imaging biomarker genomics has been developed in recent years to reveal potential AD pathological mechanisms and provide early diagnoses. This technique integrates multimodal imaging phenotypes with genetic data in a noninvasive and high-throughput manner. In this review, we summarize the basic analytical framework of brain imaging biomarker genomics and elucidate two main implementation scenarios of this technique in AD studies: (1) exploring novel biomarkers and seeking mutual interpretability and (2) providing a diagnosis and prognosis for AD with combined use of machine learning methods and brain imaging biomarker genomics. Importantly, we highlight the necessity of brain imaging biomarker genomics, discuss the strengths and limitations of current methods, and propose directions for development of this research field.",36109823,PMC9476275,10.1186/s40035-022-00315-z,6
A 3-Gene-Based Diagnostic Signature in Alzheimer's Disease,"Background:Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a chronic neurodegenerative disease. In this study, potential diagnostic biomarkers were identified for AD.Methods:All AD samples and healthy samples were collected from 2 datasets in the GEO database, in which differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were analyzed by using the limma package of R language. GO and KEGG pathway enrichment was conducted basing on the DEGs via the clusterProfiler package of R. And, the PPI network construction and gene prediction were performed using the STRING database and Cytoscape. Then, a logistic regression model was constructed to predict the sample type.Results:Bioinformatic analysis of GEO datasets revealed 2,063 and 108 DEGs in GSE5281 and GSE4226 datasets, separately, and 15 overlapping DEGs were found. GO and KEGG enrichment analysis revealed terms associated with neurodevelopment. Then, we built a logistic regression model based on the hub genes from the PPI network and optimized the model to 3 genes (ALDOA, ENC1, and NFKBIA). The values of area under the curve of the training set GSE5281 and testing set GSE4226 were 0.9647 and 0.7857, respectively, which implied the efficacy of this model.Conclusion:The comprehensive bioinformatic analysis of gene expression in AD patients and the effective logistic regression model built in our study may provide promising research value for diagnostic methods of AD.",34521086,,10.1159/000518727,6
Challenges and Discoveries in Polypharmacology of Neurodegenerative Diseases,"Background:Neurological disorders are composed of several diseases that affect the central and peripheral nervous system; among these are neurodegenerative diseases, which lead to neuronal death. Many of these diseases have treatment for the disease and symptoms, leading patients to use several drugs that cause side effects.Introduction:The search for new treatments has led to the investigation of multi-target drugs.Methods:This review aimed to investigate in the literature the multi-target effect in neurological disorders through an in silico approach. Studies were reviewed on the diseases such as epilepsy, Alzheimer's disease, Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), Huntington's disease, cerebral ischemia, and Parkinson's disease.Results:As a result, the study emphasize the relevance of research by computational techniques such as quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) prediction models, pharmacokinetic prediction models, molecular docking, and molecular dynamics, besides presenting possible drug candidates with multi-target activity.Conclusion:It was possible to identify several targets with pharmacological activities. Some of these targets had diseases in common such as carbonic anhydrase, acetylcholinesterase, NMDA, and MAO being relevant for possible multi-target approaches.",36703583,,10.2174/1568026623666230126112628,2
G-protein coupled receptors as therapeutic targets for neurodegenerative and cerebrovascular diseases,"Neurodegenerative and cerebrovascular diseases are frequent in elderly populations and comprise primarily of dementia (mainly Alzheimer's disease) Parkinson's disease and stroke. These neurological disorders (NDs) occur as a result of neurodegenerative processes and represent one of the most frequent causes of death and disability worldwide with a significant clinical and socio-economic impact. Although NDs have been characterized for many years, the exact molecular mechanisms that govern these pathologies or why they target specific individuals and specific neuronal populations remain unclear. As research progresses, many similarities appear which relate these diseases to one another on a subcellular level. Discovering these similarities offers hope for therapeutic advances that could ameliorate the conditions of many diseases simultaneously. G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) are the most abundant receptor type in the central nervous system and are linked to complex downstream pathways, manipulation of which may have therapeutic application in many NDs. This review will highlight the potential use of neurotransmitter GPCRs as emerging therapeutic targets for neurodegenerative and cerebrovascular diseases.",27620813,,10.1016/j.neuint.2016.09.005,12
"Application of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) in neurodegenerative disorders: History, findings, and prospective challenges","Over the past few decades, the application of mesenchymal stem cells has captured the attention of researchers and practitioners worldwide. These cells can be obtained from practically every tissue in the body and are used to treat a broad variety of conditions, most notably neurological diseases such as Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and Alzheimer's disease. Studies are still being conducted, and the results of these studies have led to the identification of several different molecular pathways involved in the neuroglial speciation process. These molecular systems are closely regulated and interconnected due to the coordinated efforts of many components that make up the machinery responsible for cell signaling. Within the scope of this study, we compared and contrasted the numerous mesenchymal cell sources and their cellular features. These many sources of mesenchymal cells included adipocyte cells, fetal umbilical cord tissue, and bone marrow. In addition, we investigated whether these cells can potentially treat and modify neurodegenerative illnesses.",37245265,,10.1016/j.prp.2023.154541,3
[Sleep abnormality as a potential target of disease-modifying therapy for neurodegenerative diseases],"Sleep abnormality such as frequent nocturnal arousal and decreased deep non-REM (rapid-eye-movement) sleep is a prevalent but under-recognized symptom that affects patients with various neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD). In contrast to the conventional understanding that the sleep abnormality in these patients is caused by AD or PD pathology in the brain regions regulating sleep-wake or circadian rhythm, various epidemiological studies have demonstrated the association of sleep abnormality with an increased risk of these diseases. Through various recent studies using relevant animal models to test the causal relationship between sleep abnormality and neurodegenerative diseases, the recent concept of a bidirectional relationship between sleep abnormality and neurodegenerative diseases was established. However, whether therapeutic interventions against sleep abnormality would modify the disease course of neurodegenerative diseases remains unknown. In this review, we will first provide an overview of previous studies that link neurodegenerative diseases and sleep abnormality, mainly focusing on the sleep abnormality in patients with AD. We will then introduce the studies that examined the causal relationship between sleep abnormality and neurodegenerative diseases. Finally, we will discuss possible mechanisms underlying the bidirectional relationship between sleep abnormality and neurodegenerative diseases. A better understanding of these mechanisms would lead to the development of novel pharmacological and/or non-pharmacological treatments that would modify the disease course of neurodegenerative diseases through targeting the processes related to sleep abnormality in the patients of neurodegenerative diseases.",31787681,,10.1254/fpj.154.306,0
Dynamic Handwriting Analysis for the Assessment of Neurodegenerative Diseases: A Pattern Recognition Perspective,"Neurodegenerative diseases, for instance Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD), affect the peripheral nervous system, where nerve cells send messages that control muscles in order to allow movements. Sick neurons cannot control muscles properly. Handwriting involves cognitive planning, coordination, and execution abilities. Significant changes in handwriting performance are a prominent feature of AD and PD. This paper addresses the most relevant results obtained in the field of online (dynamic) analysis of handwritten trials by AD and PD patients. The survey is made from a pattern recognition point of view, so that different phases are described. Data acquisition deals not only with the device, but also with the handwriting task. Feature extraction can deal with function and parameter features. The classification problem is also discussed along with results already obtained. This paper also highlights the most profitable research directions.",29993722,,10.1109/RBME.2018.2840679,17
Investigation of Anti-Alzheimer's Mechanisms of Sarsasapogenin Derivatives by Network-Based Combining Structure-Based Methods,"Alzheimer's disease (AD), a neurodegenerative disease with no cure, affects millions of people worldwide and has become one of the biggest healthcare challenges. Some investigated compounds play anti-AD roles at the cellular or the animal level, but their molecular mechanisms remain unclear. In this study, we designed a strategy combining network-based and structure-based methods together to identify targets for anti-AD sarsasapogenin derivatives (AAs). First, we collected drug-target interactions (DTIs) data from public databases, constructed a global DTI network, and generated drug-substructure associations. After network construction, network-based models were built for DTI prediction. The best bSDTNBI-FCFP_4 model was further used to predict DTIs for AAs. Second, a structure-based molecular docking method was employed for rescreening the prediction results to obtain more credible target proteins. Finally,in vitroexperiments were conducted for validation of the predicted targets, and Nrf2 showed significant evidence as the target of anti-AD compound AA13. Moreover, we analyzed the potential mechanisms of AA13 for the treatment of AD. Generally, our combined strategy could be applied to other novel drugs or compounds and become a useful tool in identification of new targets and elucidation of disease mechanisms. Our model was deployed on our NetInfer web server (http://lmmd.ecust.edu.cn/netinfer/).",37104820,,10.1021/acs.jcim.3c00018,1
Glial Cells - The Key Elements of Alzheimer´s Disease,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex neurodegenerative disorder with major clinical hallmarks of memory loss, dementia, and cognitive impairment. Besides the extensive neuron-oriented research, an increasing body of evidence suggests that glial cells, namely astrocytes, microglia, NG2 glia and oligodendrocytes, may play an important role in the pathogenesis of this disease. In the first part of this review, AD pathophysiology in humans is briefly described and compared with disease progression in routinely used animal models. The relevance of findings obtained in animal models of AD is also discussed with respect to AD pathology in humans. Further, this review summarizes recent findings regarding the role/participation of glial cells in pathogenesis of AD, focusing on changes in their morphology, functions, proteins and gene expression profiles. As for astrocytes and microglia, they are fundamental for the progression and outcome of AD either because they function as effector cells releasing cytokines that play a role in neuroprotection, or because they fail to fulfill their homeostatic functions, ultimately leaving neurons to face excitotoxicity and oxidative stress. Next, we turn our attention towards NG2 glia, a novel and distinct class of glial cells in the central nervous system (CNS), whose role in a variety of human CNS diseases has begun to emerge, and we also consider the participation of oligodendrocytes in the pathogenesis and progression of AD. Since AD is currently an incurable disease, in the last part of our review we hypothesize about possible glia-oriented treatments and provide a perspective of possible future advancements in this field.",26825092,,10.2174/1567205013666160129095924,50
Mitochondrial and Ubiquitin Proteasome System Dysfunction in Ageing and Disease: Two Sides of the Same Coin?,"Mitochondrial dysfunction and impairment of the ubiquitin proteasome system have been described as two hallmarks of the ageing process. Additionally, both systems have been implicated in the etiopathogenesis of many age-related diseases, particularly neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease. Interestingly, these two systems are closely interconnected, with the ubiquitin proteasome system maintaining mitochondrial homeostasis by regulating organelle dynamics, the proteome, and mitophagy, and mitochondrial dysfunction impairing cellular protein homeostasis by oxidative damage. Here, we review the current literature and argue that the interplay of the two systems should be considered in order to better understand the cellular dysfunction observed in ageing and age-related diseases. Such an approach may provide valuable insights into molecular mechanisms underlying the ageing process, and further discovery of treatments to counteract ageing and its associated diseases. Furthermore, we provide a hypothetical model for the heterogeneity described among individuals during ageing.",26287188,PMC4581307,10.3390/ijms160819458,44
Mechanisms of neurodegeneration - Insights from familial Alzheimer's disease,"The rising prevalence of Alzheimer's disease (AD), together with the lack of effective treatments, portray it as one of the major health challenges of our times. Untangling AD implies advancing the knowledge of the biology that gets disrupted during the disease while deciphering the molecular and cellular mechanisms leading to AD-related neurodegeneration. In fact, a solid mechanistic understanding of the disease processes stands as an essential prerequisite for the development of safe and effective treatments. Genetics has provided invaluable clues to the genesis of the disease by revealing deterministic genes - Presenilins (PSENs) and the Amyloid Precursor Protein (APP) - that, when affected, lead in an autosomal dominant manner to early-onset, familial AD (FAD). PSEN is the catalytic subunit of the membrane-embedded γ-secretase complexes, which act as proteolytic switches regulating key cell signalling cascades. Importantly, these intramembrane proteases are responsible for the production of Amyloid β (Aβ) peptides from APP. The convergence of pathogenic mutations on one functional pathway, the amyloidogenic cleavage of APP, strongly supports the significance of this process in AD pathogenesis. Here, we review and discuss the state-of-the-art knowledge of the molecular mechanisms underlying FAD, their implications for the sporadic form of the disease and for the development of safe AD therapeutics.",32418657,,10.1016/j.semcdb.2020.03.005,24
PSEN2 and ABCA7 variants causing early-onset preclinical pathological changes in Alzheimer's disease: a case report and literature review,"Background:Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a debilitating and highly heritable neurodegenerative disease. Early-onset AD (EOAD) was defined as AD occurring before age 65. Although it has a high genetic risk, EOAD due to PSEN2 variation is very rare. ABCA7 is an important risk gene for AD. Previously reported cases mainly carried variations in a single pathogenic or risk gene. METHODS AND RESULTS: In this study, we report a 35-year-old female carrying variants in both the PSEN2 gene (c.640G > T p.V214L) and ABCA7 gene (c.2848G > A p.V950M). Four previously reported cases carried PSEN2 V214L, and no reported cases carried ABCA7 V950M. She had a history of migraine, patent foramen ovale, spontaneous subarachnoid hemorrhage without aneurysm, and multiple cerebral microhemorrhages. Her MMSE score was 24/30, and her MoCA score was 22/30. The concentration of Aβ42 and the ratio of Aβ42 to Aβ40 in cerebral spinal fluid were obviously decreased. Published variants of PSEN2 and ABCA7 in PubMed were reviewed, and the patients' characteristics were summarized and compared to provide information for the clinical diagnosis of AD.Conclusions:It is necessary to conduct genetic screening in cases with atypical manifestations.",36701017,,10.1007/s10072-023-06602-5,0
ADAM10 as a therapeutic target for brain diseases: from developmental disorders to Alzheimer's disease,"In the central nervous system a disintegrin and metalloproteinase 10 (ADAM10) controls several functions such as neurodevelopment, synaptic plasticity and dendritic spine morphology thanks to its activity towards a high number of substrates, including the synaptic cell adhesion molecules as the Amyloid Precursor Protein, N-cadherin, Notch and Ephrins. In particular, ADAM10 plays a key role in the modulation of the molecular mechanisms responsible for dendritic spine formation, maturation and stabilization and in the regulation of the molecular organization of the glutamatergic synapse. Consequently, an alteration of ADAM10 activity is strictly correlated to the onset of different types of synaptopathies, ranging from neurodevelopmental disorders, i.e. autism spectrum disorders, to neurodegenerative diseases, i.e. Alzheimer's Disease. Areas covered: We describe the most recent discoveries in understanding of the role of ADAM10 activity at the glutamatergic excitatory synapse and its involvement in the onset of neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders. Expert opinion: A progress in the understanding of the molecular mechanisms driving ADAM10 activity at synapses and its alterations in brain disorders is the first step before designing a specific drug able to modulate ADAM10 activity.",28960088,,10.1080/14728222.2017.1386176,25
Microglia in neurodegenerative diseases: mechanism and potential therapeutic targets,"Microglia activation is observed in various neurodegenerative diseases. Recent advances in single-cell technologies have revealed that these reactive microglia were with high spatial and temporal heterogeneity. Some identified microglia in specific states correlate with pathological hallmarks and are associated with specific functions. Microglia both exert protective function by phagocytosing and clearing pathological protein aggregates and play detrimental roles due to excessive uptake of protein aggregates, which would lead to microglial phagocytic ability impairment, neuroinflammation, and eventually neurodegeneration. In addition, peripheral immune cells infiltration shapes microglia into a pro-inflammatory phenotype and accelerates disease progression. Microglia also act as a mobile vehicle to propagate protein aggregates. Extracellular vesicles released from microglia and autophagy impairment in microglia all contribute to pathological progression and neurodegeneration. Thus, enhancing microglial phagocytosis, reducing microglial-mediated neuroinflammation, inhibiting microglial exosome synthesis and secretion, and promoting microglial conversion into a protective phenotype are considered to be promising strategies for the therapy of neurodegenerative diseases. Here we comprehensively review the biology of microglia and the roles of microglia in neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, multiple system atrophy, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, frontotemporal dementia, progressive supranuclear palsy, corticobasal degeneration, dementia with Lewy bodies and Huntington's disease. We also summarize the possible microglia-targeted interventions and treatments against neurodegenerative diseases with preclinical and clinical evidence in cell experiments, animal studies, and clinical trials.",37735487,PMC10514343,10.1038/s41392-023-01588-0,31
[THE RETINA AS A TOOL FOR EARLY DIAGNOSIS OF ALZHEIMER DISEASE],"Alzheimer's disease is a neurodegenerative disease pathologically characterized by accumulation of abnormal amyloid-beta (Aβ) and tau proteins. Research is currently focused on developing treatments to reduce the risk of developing or inhibiting disease progression. Therefore, there is a need to identify diagnostic tools for the initial stages of the disease. The neuropathological processes in Alzheimer's disease exist several decades before symptoms appear and can be identified by PET imaging or CSF analysis. Still, these methods are limited in availability and may be expensive and invasive, and there is therefore a need to develop accessible, inexpensive and non-invasive diagnostic tools. The retina is a component of the central nervous system. Changes in the retina can reflect the cerebral pathological process in Alzheimer's disease. Indeed, evidence of Aβ plaques and abnormal tau proteins in the retina of Alzheimer's patients has been reported. The advantage of the retina is its accessibility for direct visualization by existing and non-invasive means. The following review will examine retinal changes that are suggested as possible biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease and discuss directions for future research in the field.",35979573,,,0
"Catechol-O-methyltransferase, Cognition and Alzheimer's Disease","Objective:Cognition is a complex trait representing a set of all mental abilities and processes related to knowledge. Although diverse brain regions are involved, most cognitive processes appear to engage cortical regions. The activity of dopaminergic neurons in prefrontal cortex represents a biological substrate underlying cognitive functions. Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is the most frequent dementia associated with cognitive impairments. Cognitive impairment in AD starts slowly with discrete deterioration in memory, language, thinking and reasoning, but it progresses into more severe and debilitating cognitive dysfunction. Cognitive function is affected by the complex interactions between various genetic, epigenetic, developmental and environmental factors. One of the most studied genes, associated with cognitive disturbances, is the gene coding for Catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT), the enzyme with major role in dopamine metabolism and modulation of different brain functions. Therefore, COMT is studied as a target for many neuropsychiatric disorders, including dementias and AD. The COMT Val158/108Met functional polymorphism affects significantly the enzyme activity and consequently cognitive performance associated with altered dopamine function. The association of COMT Val158/108Met polymorphism with some cognitive domains and psychosis in AD was reported in some but not in all studies. Besides COMT Val158/108Met polymorphism, other risk genotypes or haplotypes should be evaluated to determine the association of COMT with cognitive decline in AD.Conclusion:Better understanding of the role of COMT in cognitive processes in AD, as well as integration of neurobiological, genetic, genomic and epigenetic data, might help in developing new potential therapies of cognitive impairments and psychotic symptoms, characteristic features of AD.",29231139,,10.2174/1567205015666171212094229,18
The Involvement of Melatonin and Tasimelteon against Alzheimer's Disease,"Background:Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an age-dependent neurodegenerative disease with progressive cognition and memory loss, insomnia, and other abnormal behavioral changes. Amongst various hypotheses for AD pathophysiology, occupational stress-induced Alzheimer's has recently been reported in many AD cases.Objective:Studies pertaining to the same suggest that stress leads to insomnia or sleep disruption, which further leads to neuroinflammation due to oxidative stress, both of which are major harbingers of AD. Additionally, overall sleep deficit is associated with progressive cognitive and memory decline, which adds more inconvenience to Alzheimer's disease. Based on this, any triumphant AD management needs a pharmacological intervention that can not only antagonize the amyloid betainduced neurotoxicity but also correct the sleep-wake cycle disruption. Chronobiotic therapeutics like melatonin offer vital neuroprotective effects by eliciting its action through more than one of the pathologies of AD. This is also bolstered by the finding that endogenous melatonin levels are lower in AD patients. This melatonin replacement therapy can be especially useful in AD treatment, but only in the early phases of the disease and in cases where the melatonin receptors are intact and functioning.Conclusion:To negate such limitations and extend the action and therapeutic efficacy of melatonin- mediated actions towards AD treatment, melatonin analogue like tasimelteon can pose a high therapeutic value in AD treatment superior to that provided by melatonin. This review encapsulates all details about how AD is believed to occur and how current situations influence it, along with how melatonin and tasimelteon act towards treating Alzheimer's.",35585820,,10.2174/1574886317666220517125644,1
Emerging nanotechnology for Alzheimer's disease: From detection to treatment,"Alzheimer's disease (AD), one of the most common chronic neurodegenerative diseases, is characterized by memory impairment, synaptic dysfunction, and character mutations. The pathological features of AD are Aβ accumulation, tau protein enrichment, oxidative stress, and immune inflammation. Since the pathogenesis of AD is complicated and ambiguous, it is still challenging to achieve early detection and timely treatment of AD. Due to the unique physical, electrical, magnetic, and optical properties of nanoparticles (NPs), nanotechnology has shown great potential for detecting and treating AD. This review provides an overview of the latest developments in AD detection via nanotechnology based on NPs with electrochemical sensing, optical sensing, and imaging techniques. Meanwhile, we highlight the important advances in nanotechnology-based AD treatment through targeting disease biomarkers, stem-cell therapy and immunotherapy. Furthermore, we summarize the current challenges and present a promising prospect for nanotechnology-based AD diagnosis and intervention.",37414222,,10.1016/j.jconrel.2023.07.004,3
Neuroprotective effects of polysaccharide from Sparassis crispa on Alzheimer's disease-like mice: Involvement of microbiota-gut-brain axis,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an irreversible neurodegenerative disease that may cause neurotoxicity and imbalance in gut microbiota. A polysaccharide derived from Sparassis crispa-1 (SCP-1) acts as a neuroprotective agent in vitro. There is, however, no clarity on the mechanism responsible for SCP-1's neuroprotective effects against AD. In this study, C57BL/6J male mice were treated with D-galactose and AlCl3to establish an animal model of AD, followed by treatment with SCP-1. As evidenced by behavioral tests and brain pathology, SCP-1 treatment ameliorated learning deficits and defective spatial recognition, reduced amyloidogenesis, and modulated the neurotransmitter levels (γ-aminobutyric acid, glutamate, and acetylcholine) in the brain of AD mice. The results of 16S rRNA sequencing revealed that SCP-1 reshaped the gut microbiota composition, especially by promoting the proliferation of butyrate-producing genera, such as Intestinaimonas, [Eubacterium] ventriosum group, Lachnospiraceae_UCG_010, and Lachnospiraceae_UCG_001, and suppressing the growth of inflammation-related bacteria (i.e., Escherichia/Shigella). Furthermore, SCP-1 significantly attenuated inflammation by reducing the levels of inflammatory cytokines, maintaining intestinal barrier function, inhibiting glial activation, and decreasing the expression of toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB). Collectively, our findings suggest that SCP-1 may prevent the development of AD via modulation of gut microbiota and suppression of inflammation, for a potential application in preventing or managing AD.",36402384,,10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2022.11.160,8
"Melatonin Attenuates Memory Impairment, Amyloid-β Accumulation, and Neurodegeneration in a Rat Model of Sporadic Alzheimer's Disease","Melatonin is a multifunctional molecule and plays a crucial role in the regulation of circadian rhythms. The role of melatonin in the protection of the central nervous system is well documented. Therefore, melatonin was proposed as a possible therapeutic agent for reducing the severity of Alzheimer's disease (AD), a progressive neurodegenerative disease characterized by cognitive decline and memory dysfunction. Recently, we showed beneficial neuroprotective effects of prophylactic supplementation with melatonin in a suitable model of sporadic AD: OXYS rats, which exhibit disturbances in melatonin secretion. In the present study, we demonstrated that melatonin administration, when started at the age of active progression of AD-like pathology, decreased the amyloid-β1 - 42 and amyloid-β1 - 40 levels in the hippocampus and amyloid-β1 - 42 levels in the frontal cortex of OXYS rats. Furthermore, oral administration of melatonin slowed down degenerative alterations in hippocampal neurons of OXYS rats. The most noticeable improvement was observed in the CA1 region of the hippocampus. Melatonin administration prevented the decrease in the mitochondria-occupied portion of the neuronal volume and improved the ultrastructure of mitochondria in the neurons of the CA1 region. Additionally, melatonin treatment of OXYS rats slowed down an increase in anxiety and deterioration of reference memory. Thus, melatonin administration could alleviate the burden of AD and may be considered a promising pharmaceutical treatment of the disease.",26402759,,10.3233/JAD-150161,32
[LATE: not every dementia is Alzheimer's disease-Discussion of a new disease entity based on a case example : Current status of limbic-predominant age-related TDP-43 encephalopathy (LATE)],"Limbic-predominant age-related TDP-43 (Transactivation response(TAR)-DNA-binding protein 43 kDa) encephalopathy (LATE) has recently been characterized as a distinct neuropathological entity within the spectrum of dementia. Neuropathological alterations in the sense of LATE were already previously described as a comorbidity to Alzheimer's disease (AD) and it has been diagnosed independently from AD pathology in autopsy studies since 2008. The framework of LATE would account for the pathogenetic impact of limbic TDP-43 proteinopathy as a driver of amnestic dementia, either together with comorbid typical AD changes or as a distinct feature. The LATE possibly explains divergent clinical observations and biomarker results in patients suffering from severe amnestic impairment without biomarker evidence of AD-related amyloid and tau alterations. Whether LATE represents a distinct neuropathological entity or is part of the spectrum of neurodegenerative diseases associated with TDP-43 is currently a matter of debate. Further studies on the role of TDP-43 in the development of amnestic dementia are urgently needed. Thus, the enrichment of an amnestic phenotype in amyloid-centered therapeutic drug studies bears the risk of higher rates of patients with TDP-43 comorbidity, which could hinder the proof of efficacy in such trials. This article presents the current state of the discussion on LATE and illustrates the concept and the clinical considerations with a case study.",32409844,PMC7809002,10.1007/s00115-020-00922-z,2
Cellular senescence in brain aging and neurodegenerative diseases: evidence and perspectives,"Along with a general decline in overall health, most chronic degenerative human diseases are inherently associated with increasing age. Age-associated cognitive impairments and neurodegenerative diseases, such as Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases, are potentially debilitating conditions that lack viable options for treatment, resulting in a tremendous economic and societal cost. Most high-profile clinical trials for neurodegenerative diseases have led to inefficacious results, suggesting that novel approaches to treating these pathologies are needed. Numerous recent studies have demonstrated that senescent cells, which are characterized by sustained cell cycle arrest and production of a distinct senescence-associated secretory phenotype, accumulate with age and at sites of age-related diseases throughout the body, where they actively promote tissue deterioration. Cells with features of senescence have been detected in the context of brain aging and neurodegenerative disease, suggesting that they may also promote dysfunction. Here, we discuss the evidence implicating senescent cells in neurodegenerative diseases, the mechanistic contribution of these cells that may actively drive neurodegeneration, and how these cells or their effects may be targeted therapeutically.",29457783,PMC5873891,10.1172/JCI95145,185
Retinoic Acid and the Gut Microbiota in Alzheimer's Disease: Fighting Back-to-Back?,"Background:There is growing evidence that the gut microbiota may play an important role in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease. However, how these commensals influence disease risk and progression still has to be deciphered.Objective:The objective of this review was to summarize current knowledge on the interplay between gut microbiota and retinoic acid. The latter one represents one of the important micronutrients, which have been correlated to Alzheimer's disease and are used in initial therapeutic intervention studies.Methods:A selective overview of the literature is given with the focus on the function of retinoic acid in the healthy and diseased brain, its metabolism in the gut, and the potential influence that the bioactive ligand may have on microbiota, gut physiology and, Alzheimer's disease.Results:Retinoic acid can influence neuronal functionality by means of plasticity but also by neurogenesis and modulating proteostasis. Impaired retinoid-signaling, therefore, might contribute to the development of diseases in the brain. Despite its rather direct impact, retinoic acid also influences other organ systems such as gut by regulating the residing immune cells but also factors such as permeability or commensal microbiota. These in turn can also interfere with retinoid-metabolism and via the gutbrain- axis furthermore with Alzheimer's disease pathology within the brain.Conclusion:Potentially, it is yet too early to conclude from the few reports on changed microbiota in Alzheimer's disease to a dysfunctional role in retinoid-signaling. However, there are several routes how microbial commensals might affect and might be affected by vitamin A and its derivatives.",30907321,,10.2174/1567205016666190321163705,12
Mitochondrial dysfunction in neurodegenerative disorders,"Recent advances in understanding the role of mitochondrial dysfunction in neurodegenerative diseases have expanded the opportunities for neurotherapeutics targeting mitochondria to alleviate symptoms and slow disease progression. In this review, we offer a historical account of advances in mitochondrial biology and neurodegenerative disease. Additionally, we summarize current knowledge of the normal physiology of mitochondria and the pathogenesis of mitochondrial dysfunction, the role of mitochondrial dysfunction in neurodegenerative disease, current therapeutics and recent therapeutic advances, as well as future directions for neurotherapeutics targeting mitochondrial function. A focus is placed on reactive oxygen species and their role in the disruption of telomeres and their effects on the epigenome. The effects of mitochondrial dysfunction in the etiology and progression of Alzheimer's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, and Huntington's disease are discussed in depth.

On the limits of graph neural networks for the early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease whose molecular mechanisms are activated several years before cognitive symptoms appear. Genotype-based prediction of the phenotype is thus a key challenge for the early diagnosis of AD. Machine learning techniques that have been proposed to address this challenge do not consider known biological interactions between the genes used as input features, thus neglecting important information about the disease mechanisms at play. To mitigate this, we first extracted AD subnetworks from several protein-protein interaction (PPI) databases and labeled these with genotype information (number of missense variants) to make them patient-specific. Next, we trained Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) on the patient-specific networks for phenotype prediction. We tested different PPI databases and compared the performance of the GNN models to baseline models using classical machine learning techniques, as well as randomized networks and input datasets. The overall results showed that GNNs could not outperform a baseline predictor only using the APOE gene, suggesting that missense variants are not sufficient to explain disease risk beyond the APOE status. Nevertheless, our results show that GNNs outperformed other machine learning techniques and that protein-protein interactions lead to superior results compared to randomized networks. These findings highlight that gene interactions are a valuable source of information in predicting disease status.",36271229,PMC9587223,10.1038/s41598-022-21491-y,4
[Focused ultrasound as a non-invasive method with therapeutic potential in patients with Alzheimer's disease],"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a common, progressive neurodegenerative disease characterized by abnormal deposition of β-amyloid (Aβ) and hyperphosphorylated tau protein. Despite the fact that biomarkers and methods of treating AD are currently being actively studied, there is still no therapy that can significantly reduce the progression of this disease. Therefore, the search for therapeutic disease-modifying strategies is becoming increasingly popular. One such strategy is the use of focused ultrasound (FUS) under MRI guidance using a contrast agent (microbubbles). Under the influence of low-intensity FUS, the blood-brain barrier (BBB) is temporarily opened, which is the main obstacle to the effective delivery of therapeutic compounds to the brain, imposing dimensional and biochemical restrictions on the passage of molecules. One of the processes associated with AD is BBB dysfunction, and therefore the study of the effects of FUS in patients with AD is of interest. The literature data show the effectiveness of FUS in animal models of AD. The researchers attribute the effectiveness of the method to the fact that exposure to FUS induces the opening of BBB and reduces the number of amyloid plaques. It has also been demonstrated that FUS can facilitate the delivery of therapeutic drugs to the brain. This allows considering FUS as a new non-invasive method of treatment. Further research is needed to assess the effectiveness of this method in patients with AD.",36279227,,10.17116/jnevro202212210138,0
Plants of the GenusMahoniaas a Potential Traditional Chinese Medicine for the Prevention and Treatment of Alzheimer's Disease,"Alzheimer's disease (AD), a prevalent multiple neurodegenerative disease, has gained attention, particularly in the aging population. However, presently available therapies merely focus on alleviating the symptoms of AD and fail to slow disease progression significantly. Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has been used to ameliorate symptoms or interfere with the pathogenesis of aging-associated diseases for many years based on disease-modifying in multiple pathological roles with multi-targets, multi-systems and multi-aspects. Mahonia species as a TCM present potential for anti-inflammatory activity, antioxidant activity, anti-acetylcholinesterase activity, and antiamyloid- beta activity that was briefly discussed in this review. They are regarded as promising drug candidates for AD therapy.

This type of registry already exists in the United States (www.brainhealthregistry.org/) and the Netherlands (https://hersenonderzoek.nl/). It contributes, as do these initiating sites, to the creation of a global database of research partnersbwho wish to contribute by participating in studies on neurodegenerative diseases and more particularly on Alzheimer's disease. By registering, they provide a certain amount of information and become potential research partners. Researchers can then select a panel of volunteers according to the selection and exclusion criteria of their studies, contact them and include them in their studies.",34910407,,,1
Physical activity delays hippocampal neurodegeneration and rescues memory deficits in an Alzheimer disease mouse model,"The evidence for a protective role of physical activity on the risk and progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD) has been growing in the last years. Here we studied the influence of a prolonged physical and cognitive stimulation on neurodegeneration, with special emphasis on hippocampal neuron loss and associated behavioral impairment in the Tg4-42 mouse model of AD. Tg4-42 mice overexpress Aβ4-42 without any mutations, and develop an age-dependent hippocampal neuron loss associated with a severe memory decline. We demonstrate that long-term voluntary exercise diminishes CA1 neuron loss and completely rescues spatial memory deficits in different experimental settings. This was accompanied by changes in the gene expression profile of Tg4-42 mice. Deep sequencing analysis revealed an upregulation of chaperones involved in endoplasmatic reticulum protein processing, which might be intimately linked to the beneficial effects seen upon long-term exercise. We believe that we provide evidence for the first time that enhanced physical activity counteracts neuron loss and behavioral deficits in a transgenic AD mouse model. The present findings underscore the relevance of increased physical activity as a potential strategy in the prevention of dementia.",27138799,PMC5070068,10.1038/tp.2016.65,32
Probiotics Treatment Can Improve Cognition in Patients with Mild Cognitive Impairment: A Systematic Review,"Background:In recent years, the existence of the gut-brain axis and the impact of intestinal microbiota on brain function has received much attention. Accumulated evidence has prompted the postulation of the infectious hypothesis underlying or facilitating neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease. Under this hypothesis, intervention with probiotics could be useful at a preventive and therapeutic level.Objective:The objective of this systematic review is to reveal a benefit of improved cognitive function following the use of probiotics in individuals with mild cognitive impairment.Methods:We searched bibliographic databases and analyzed in detail the evidence and methodological quality of five recent randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials using the Cochrane Tool and the SIGN checklist.Results:Overall, and with satisfactory methodological quality, the evaluated studies support the use of probiotics as a weapon to slow the progression of cognitive decline in subjects with mild cognitive impairment. The reviewed literature also indicates that maximum benefit of probiotics is found in subjects with incipient cognitive dysfunction and has no effect in those with advanced disease or absence of disease.Conclusion:These results support the intervention with probiotics, especially as a preventive approach. However, caution is required in the interpretation of the results as microbiota has not been evaluated in all studies, and further large-scale research with a prolonged study period is necessary to ensure the translatability of the results into real practice.",36093709,,10.3233/JAD-220615,4
Update on PET in neurodegenerative and neuroinflammatory disorders manifesting on a behavioural level: imaging for differential diagnosis,"Purpose of review:To give an update on recent findings concerning the use of PET for differential diagnosis in neurodegenerative and neuroinflammatory disorders manifesting on a behavioural level.Recent findings:Although accurate differential diagnosis of dementia can be achieved by imaging disease-specific patterns of cerebral glucose metabolism with [F]fluorodeoxyglucose ([F]FDG)-PET, the diagnostic impact of [F]FDG-PET in primary psychiatric disorders is limited. Amyloid-beta PET provides an incremental value beyond [F]FDG-PET in the differential diagnosis of dementia and was proposed as a biomarker defining the so-called Alzheimer continuum. Recently developed tau-specific tracers might also aid in the diagnostic process (biological definition of Alzheimer's disease together with amyloid-beta). Surpassing the diagnostic accuracy of other techniques, such as MRI, [F]FDG-PET has also gained widespread clinical use for diagnosis and follow-up of paraneoplastic and autoimmune disorders of the central nervous system (CNS) as an important differential diagnosis for rapid progressive dementia and subacute onset of psychiatric syndromes.Summary:Molecular neuroimaging with PET is an established method for the differential diagnosis of neurodegenerative and autoimmune CNS disorders manifesting on a behavioural level with significant therapeutic and prognostic impact. Future prospective studies are needed to define the value of tau imaging for diagnosis and prognosis in neurodegenerative disorders.",31107281,,10.1097/WCO.0000000000000706,3
Calcium sensor Yellow Cameleon 3.6 as a tool to support the calcium hypothesis of Alzheimer's disease,"Introduction:Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease with increasing relevance as dementia cases rise. The etiology of AD is widely debated. The Calcium Hypothesis of Alzheimer's disease and brain aging states that the dysfunction of calcium signaling is the final common pathway leading to neurodegeneration. When the Calcium Hypothesis was originally coined, the technology did not exist to test it, but with the advent of Yellow Cameleon 3.6 (YC3.6) we are able to test its validity.Methods:Here we review use of YC3.6 in studying Alzheimer's disease using mouse models and discuss whether these studies support or refute the Calcium Hypothesis.Results:YC3.6 studies showed that amyloidosis preceded dysfunction in neuronal calcium signaling and changes in synapse structure. This evidence supports the Calcium Hypothesis.Discussion:In vivo YC3.6 studies point to calcium signaling as a promising therapeutic target; however, additional work is necessary to translate these findings to humans.",37154246,,10.1002/alz.13111,1
Stem cell-conditioned medium is a promising treatment for Alzheimer's disease,"Background and aim:Alzheimer's disease (AD), a prevalent progressive neurodegenerative disease, is mainly characterized by dementia, memory loss, and cognitive disorder. Rising research was performed to develop pharmacological or non-pharmacological approaches to treat or improve AD complications. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are stromal cells that can self-renew and exhibit multilineage differentiation. Recent evidence suggested that some of the therapeutic effects of MSCs are mediated by the secreted paracrine factors. These paracrine factors, called MSC- conditioned medium (MSC-CM), may stimulate endogenous repair, promote angio- and artery genesis, and reduce apoptosis through paracrine mechanisms. The current study aims to systematically review the advantages of MSC-CM to the development of research and therapeutic concepts for AD management.Material and methods:The present systematic review was performed using PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus from April 2020 to May 2022 following the ""Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews"" (PRISMA) guidelines. The keywords, including ""Conditioned medium OR Conditioned media OR Stem cell therapy"" AND ""Alzheimer's,"" was searched, and finally, 13 papers were extracted.Results:The obtained data revealed that MSC-CMs might positively affect neurodegenerative diseases prognosis, especially AD, through various mechanisms, including a decrease in neuro-inflammation, reduction of oxidative stress and Aβ formation, modulation of Microglia function and count, reduction of apoptosis, induction of synaptogenesis and neurogenesis. Also, the results showed that MSC-CM administration could significantly improve cognitive and memory function, increase the expression of neurotrophic factors, decrease the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, improve mitochondrial function, reduce cytotoxicity, and increase neurotransmitter levels.Conclusion:While inhibiting the induction of neuroinflammation could be considered the first therapeutic effect of CMs, the prevention of apoptosis could be regarded as the most crucial effect of CMs on AD improvement.",37311523,,10.1016/j.bbr.2023.114543,1
Role of Long Non-coding RNAs in the Pathogenesis of Alzheimer's and Parkinson's Diseases,"Neurodegenerative diseases are a diverse group of diseases that are now one of the leading causes of morbidity in the elderly population. These diseases include Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), Huntington's disease (HD), Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), etc. Although these diseases have a common characteristic feature of progressive neuronal loss from various parts of the brain, they differ in the clinical symptoms and risk factors, leading to the development and progression of the diseases. AD is a neurological condition that leads to dementia and cognitive decline due to neuronal cell death in the brain, whereas PD is a movement disorder affecting neuro-motor function and develops due to the death of the dopaminergic neurons in the brain, resulting in decreased dopamine levels. Currently, the only treatment available for these neurodegenerative diseases involves reducing the rate of progression of neuronal loss. This necessitates the development of efficient early biomarkers and effective therapies for these diseases. Long non-coding RNAs (LncRNAs) belong to a large family of non-coding transcripts with a minimum length of 200 nucleotides. They are implied to be involved in the development of the brain, a variety of diseases, and epigenetic, transcriptional, and posttranscriptional levels of gene regulation. Aberrant expression of lncRNAs in the CNS is considered to play a major role in the development and progression of AD and PD, two of the most leading causes of morbidity among elderly populations. In this mini-review, we discuss the role of various long non-coding RNAs in neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease, which can further be studied for the development of potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets for various neurodegenerative diseases.",35081899,,10.2174/1874609815666220126095847,3
Mitochondrial Dysfunction as a Causative Factor in Alzheimer's Disease-Spectrum Disorders: Lymphocytes as a Window to the Brain,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common progressive neurodegenerative disease. Today, AD affects millions of people worldwide and the number of AD cases will further increase with longer life expectancy. The AD brain is marked by severe neurodegeneration, such as the loss of synapses and neurons, atrophy and depletion of neurotransmitter systems, especially in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex. Recent findings highlight the important role of mitochondrial dysfunction and increased oxidative stress in the pathophysiology of late-onset alzheimer's disease (LOAD). These alterations are not only observed in the brain of AD patients but also in the periphery. In this review, we discuss the potential role of elevated apoptosis, increased oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction as peripheral markers for the detection of AD in blood cells e.g. lymphocytes. We evaluate recent findings regarding impaired mitochondrial function comprising mitochondrial respiration, reduced complex activities of the respiratory chain and altered Mitochondrial Membrane Potential (MMP) in lymphocytes as well as in neurons. Finally, we will question whether these mitochondrial parameters might be suitable as an early peripheral marker for the detection of LOAD but also for the transitional stage between normal aging and Dementia, ""Mild Cognitive Impairment"" (MCI).",34879802,,10.2174/1567205018666211208141512,5
The Role of Bioenergetics in Neurodegeneration,"Bioenergetic and mitochondrial dysfunction are common hallmarks of neurodegenerative diseases. Decades of research describe how genetic and environmental factors initiate changes in mitochondria and bioenergetics across Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Mitochondria control many cellular processes, including proteostasis, inflammation, and cell survival/death. These cellular processes and pathologies are common across neurodegenerative diseases. Evidence suggests that mitochondria and bioenergetic disruption may drive pathological changes, placing mitochondria as an upstream causative factor in neurodegenerative disease onset and progression. Here, we discuss evidence of mitochondrial and bioenergetic dysfunction in neurodegenerative diseases and address how mitochondria can drive common pathological features of these diseases.",36012480,PMC9409169,10.3390/ijms23169212,7
Neural regeneration therapies for Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease-related disorders,"Neurodegenerative diseases are devastating mental illnesses without a cure. Alzheimer's disease (AD) characterized by memory loss, multiple cognitive impairments, and changes in personality and behavior. Although tremendous progress has made in understanding the basic biology in disease processes in AD and PD, we still do not have early detectable biomarkers for these diseases. Just in the United States alone, federal and nonfederal funding agencies have spent billions of dollars on clinical trials aimed at finding drugs, but we still do not have a drug or an agent that can slow the AD or PD disease process. One primary reason for this disappointing result may be that the clinical trials enroll patients with AD or PD at advances stages. Although many drugs and agents are tested preclinical and are promising, in human clinical trials, they are mostly ineffective in slowing disease progression. One therapy that has been promising is 'stem cell therapy' based on cell culture and pre-clinical studies. In the few clinical studies that have investigated therapies in clinical trials with AD and PD patients at stage I. The therapies, such as stem cell transplantation - appear to delay the symptoms in AD and PD. The purpose of this article is to describe clinical trials using 1) stem cell transplantation methods in AD and PD mouse models and 2) regenerative medicine in AD and PD mouse models, and 3) the current status of investigating preclinical stem cell transplantation in patients with AD and PD.",31276770,,10.1016/j.bbadis.2019.06.020,22
Oxidative stress: A major pathogenesis and potential therapeutic target of antioxidative agents in Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease,"Oxidative stress reflects an imbalance between the overproduction and incorporation of free radicals and the dynamic ability of a biosystem to detoxify reactive intermediates. Free radicals produced by oxidative stress are one of the common features in several experimental models of diseases. Free radicals affect both the structure and function of neural cells, and contribute to a wide range of neurodegenerative diseases, including Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease. Although the precise mechanisms that result in the degeneration of neurons and the relevant pathological changes remain unclear, the crucial role of oxidative stress in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases is associated with several proteins (such as α-synuclein, DJ-1, Amyloid β and tau protein) and some signaling pathways (such as extracellular regulated protein kinases, phosphoinositide 3-kinase/Protein Kinase B pathway and extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1/2) that are tightly associated with the neural damage. In this review, we present evidence, gathered over the last decade, concerning a variety of pathogenic proteins, their important signaling pathways and pathogenic mechanisms associated with oxidative stress in Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease. Proper control and regulation of these proteins' functions and the related signaling pathways may be a promising therapeutic approach to the patients. We also emphasizes antioxidative options, including some new neuroprotective agents that eliminate excess reactive oxygen species efficiently and have a certain therapeutic effect; however, controversy surrounds some of them in terms of the dose and length of therapy. These agents require further investigation by clinical application in patients suffering Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease.",27769868,,10.1016/j.pneurobio.2016.07.005,234
"Neurodegenerative Disorders of Alzheimer, Parkinsonism, Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis and Multiple Sclerosis: An Early Diagnostic Approach for Precision Treatment","Neurodegenerative diseases (NDs) are characterised by progressive dysfunction of synapses, neurons, glial cells and their networks. Neurodegenerative diseases can be classified according to primary clinical features (e.g., dementia, parkinsonism, or motor neuron disease), anatomic distribution of neurodegeneration (e.g., frontotemporal degenerations, extrapyramidal disorders, or spinocerebellar degenerations), or principal molecular abnormalities. The most common neurodegenerative disorders are amyloidosis, tauopathies, a-synucleinopathy, and TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43) proteopathy. The protein abnormalities in these disorders have abnormal conformational properties along with altered cellular mechanisms, and they exhibit motor deficit, mitochondrial malfunction, dysfunctions in autophagic-lysosomal pathways, synaptic toxicity, and more emerging mechanisms such as the roles of stress granule pathways and liquid-phase transitions. Finally, for each ND, microglial cells have been reported to be implicated in neurodegeneration, in particular, because the microglial responses can shift from neuroprotective to a deleterious role. Growing experimental evidence suggests that abnormal protein conformers act as seed material for oligomerization, spreading from cell to cell through anatomically connected neuronal pathways, which may in part explain the specific anatomical patterns observed in brain autopsy sample. In this review, we mention the human pathology of select neurodegenerative disorders, focusing on how neurodegenerative disorders (i.e., Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and multiple sclerosis) represent a great healthcare problem worldwide and are becoming prevalent because of the increasing aged population. Despite many studies have focused on their etiopathology, the exact cause of these diseases is still largely unknown and until now with the only available option of symptomatic treatments. In this review, we aim to report the systematic and clinically correlated potential biomarker candidates. Although future studies are necessary for their use in early detection and progression in humans affected by NDs, the promising results obtained by several groups leads us to this idea that biomarkers could be used to design a potential therapeutic approach and preclinical clinical trials for the treatments of NDs.",34719771,,10.1007/s11011-021-00800-w,13
Animal models in the study of Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease: A historical perspective,"Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease are two of the most prevalent and disabling neurodegenerative diseases globally. Both are proteinopathic conditions and while occasionally inherited, are largely sporadic in nature. Although the advances in our understanding of the two have been significant, they are far from complete and neither diagnosis nor the current practices in treatment and rehabilitation is adequately helpful. Animal models have historically found application as testing beds for novel therapeutics and continue to be valuable aids in pharmacological research. This review chronicles the development of those models in the context of Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease, and highlights the shifting paradigms in studying two human-specific conditions in non-human organisms.",35229999,PMC8879627,10.1002/ame2.12209,10
Cannabinoid receptor CB2 ablation protects against TAU induced neurodegeneration,"Tauopathies are a group of neurodegenerative diseases characterized by the alteration/aggregation of TAU protein, for which there is still no effective treatment. Therefore, new pharmacological targets are being sought, such as elements of the endocannabinoid system (ECS). We analysed the occurrence of changes in the ECS in tauopathies and their implication in the pathogenesis. By integrating gene expression analysis, immunofluorescence, genetic and adeno-associated virus expressing TAU mouse models, we found a TAU-dependent increase in CB2receptor expression in hippocampal neurons, that occurs as an early event in the pathology and was maintained until late stages. These changes were accompanied by alterations in the endocannabinoid metabolism. Remarkably, CB2ablation in mice protects from neurodegeneration induced by hTAUP301Loverexpression, corroborated at the level of cognitive behaviour, synaptic plasticity, and aggregates of insoluble TAU. At the level of neuroinflammation, the absence of CB2did not produce significant changes in concordance with a possible neuronal location rather than its classic glial expression in these models. These findings were corroborated in post-mortem samples of patients with Alzheimer's disease, the most common tauopathy. Our results show that neurons with accumulated TAU induce the expression of the CB2receptor, which enhances neurodegeneration. These results are important for our understanding of disease mechanisms, providing a novel therapeutic strategy to be investigated in tauopathies.",34001284,PMC8130522,10.1186/s40478-021-01196-5,13
DNA Damage-Induced Neurodegeneration in Accelerated Ageing and Alzheimer's Disease,"DNA repair ensures genomic stability to achieve healthy ageing, including cognitive maintenance. Mutations on genes encoding key DNA repair proteins can lead to diseases with accelerated ageing phenotypes. Some of these diseases are xeroderma pigmentosum group A (XPA, caused by mutation ofXPA), Cockayne syndrome group A and group B (CSA, CSB, and are caused by mutations ofCSAandCSB, respectively), ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T, caused by mutation ofATM), and Werner syndrome (WS, with most cases caused by mutations inWRN). Except for WS, a common trait of the aforementioned progerias is neurodegeneration. Evidence from studies using animal models and patient tissues suggests that the associated DNA repair deficiencies lead to depletion of cellular nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+), resulting in impaired mitophagy, accumulation of damaged mitochondria, metabolic derailment, energy deprivation, and finally leading to neuronal dysfunction and loss. Intriguingly, these features are also observed in Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common type of dementia affecting more than 50 million individuals worldwide. Further studies on the mechanisms of the DNA repair deficient premature ageing diseases will help to unveil the mystery of ageing and may provide novel therapeutic strategies for AD.",34201700,PMC8268089,10.3390/ijms22136748,16
Human Pluripotent Stem Cells as In Vitro Models of Neurodegenerative Diseases,"My main research focused in the last years has been the reprogramming of differentiated cell types, such as human fibroblasts, into pluripotent stem cells called induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and the application of this technology to studies of the nervous system and the diseases that affect it. We have been working on the generation of iPSC lines from Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients using recent developments in reprogramming strategies such as non-integrating episomal vectors to produce virus-free, clinical safe hiPSC. Our study shows that neurons differentiated from these cells display important disease properties and, thus, have the potential to serve as cellular models to explore various aspects of Alzheimer's pathogenesis. One of the lab's scientific goal is to use lines of familial Alzheimer's disease (FAD)-derived induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) to generate brain-like structures (""organoids"") mimicking native brains. Three-dimensional (3D) systems, called cerebral organoids, can recapitulate distinct architectures of the human brain, such as fluid-filled cavities resembling brain ventricles and tissues organized in layers including progenitor ventricular and subventricular zones present in the native brain. Recently, we have extended our research interests in the rapidly emerging field of exosomes and micro-vesicles (called as EMVs). Extracellular vesicles of either 50-200 nm in size (called exosomes) or 200 nm-1 μm in size (called micro-vesicles) are membrane-bounded vesicles that can carry RNAs, proteins, and other metabolites and are secreted from all cell types and are present in biological fluids such as serum and plasma. We have examined properties and functions of EMVs from human iPSCs that can be cultured infinitely under a chemically defined medium and compared them with the ones secreted by human mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). Purified EVs produced by both stem cell types have similar sizes, but human iPSCs produced 16-fold more EVs than MSCs. When iPSC-EMVs were applied in culture to senescent MSCs, they reduced their elevated cellular ROS levels and alleviated aging phenotypes. We are currently exploring the potential application of EMVs in diagnostics, pathology, and therapeutics of AD. Extracellular vesicles secreted from AD patient derived neurons contain a relatively low amount of Aβ but have an increased Aβ42/ Aβ40 ratio; the majority of Aβ is located on the surface of the EVs. The results of our research can contribute substantially to the successful translation of stem cell biology into clinical therapy by improving our understanding of the pathogenesis and treatment of Alzheimer's disease.",32468463,,10.1007/978-3-030-32633-3_13,8
Pharmacological exploration of traditional plants for the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is clinically characterized as memory deficits, altered behavior and impaired cognitive functions. The most important risk factor for AD is aging and mounting. Evidences suggested in different studies that traditionally used plants in Asia, China, and Europe significantly affect aging and AD involved neurodegeneration pathways. Research into ethnobotanicals for impaired memory and cognition has been burgeoned in last decades. The inclusion and exclusion criteria for the plant selection were based on reputed herbs recommended for treatment of neurological disorders and their scientific validation to cure neurodegenerative disorders. A range of traditional plants imparts effects via acetylcholinesterase activity, β-amyloid peptide formation in plaques, neurotrophic factors and through antioxidant activity. On one side preclinical investigations identified promising drug candidates for AD, on the other side, clinical evidences are still pending. Presently, according to WHO, around more than 80% world population relay on natural remedies to cure their health related issues. Plants contain rich source of primary and secondary metabolites for improving health problems. Pharmaceutical industry is facing intriguing challenges like elevated cost and unendurable risk management due to the high burden of neurodegenerative disorders. A significant shift of drug discovery is being witnessed from synthetic moieties to herbal formulation.",32478964,,10.1002/ptr.6742,12
"Inflammation, Autoimmunity and Neurodegenerative Diseases, Therapeutics and Beyond","Neurodegenerative disease (ND) incidence has recently increased due to improved life expectancy. Alzheimer's (AD) or Parkinson's disease (PD) are the most prevalent NDs. Both diseases are poly genetic, multifactorial and heterogenous. Preventive medicine, a healthy diet, exercise, and controlling comorbidities may delay the onset. After the diseases are diagnosed, therapy is needed to slow progression. Recent studies show that local, peripheral and age-related inflammation accelerates NDs' onset and progression. Patients with autoimmune disorders like inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) could be at higher risk of developing AD or PD. However, no increase in ND incidence has been reported if the patients are adequately diagnosed and treated. Autoantibodies against abnormal tau, β amyloid and α- synuclein have been encountered in AD and PD and may be protective. This discovery led to the proposal of immune-based therapies for AD and PD involving monoclonal antibodies, immunization/ vaccines, pro-inflammatory cytokine inhibition and anti-inflammatory cytokine addition. All the different approaches have been analysed here. Future perspectives on new therapeutic strategies for both disorders are concisely examined.",37898823,,10.2174/1570159X22666231017141636,0
Zebrafish as a Potential Model for Neurodegenerative Diseases: A Focus on Toxic Metals Implications,"In the last century, industrial activities increased and caused multiple health problems for humans and animals. At this moment, heavy metals are considered the most harmful substances for their effects on organisms and humans. The impact of these toxic metals, which have no biological role, poses a considerable threat and is associated with several health problems. Heavy metals can interfere with metabolic processes and can sometimes act as pseudo-elements. The zebrafish is an animal model progressively used to expose the toxic effects of diverse compounds and to find treatments for different devastating diseases that human beings are currently facing. This review aims to analyse and discuss the value of zebrafish as animal models used in neurological conditions, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), and Parkinson's disease (PD), particularly in terms of the benefits of animal models and the limitations that exist.",36834835,PMC9959844,10.3390/ijms24043428,3
Lower Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction Relates to Cerebrospinal Fluid Biomarker Evidence of Neurodegeneration in Older Adults,"Background:Subclinical cardiac dysfunction is associated with decreased cerebral blood flow, placing the aging brain at risk for Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology and neurodegeneration.Objective:This study investigates the association between subclinical cardiac dysfunction, measured by left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers of AD and neurodegeneration.Methods:Vanderbilt Memory & Aging Project participants free of dementia, stroke, and heart failure (n = 152, 72±6 years, 68% male) underwent echocardiogram to quantify LVEF and lumbar puncture to measure CSF levels of amyloid-β42 (Aβ42), phosphorylated tau (p-tau), and total tau (t-tau). Linear regressions related LVEF to CSF biomarkers, adjusting for age, sex, race/ethnicity, education, Framingham Stroke Risk Profile, cognitive diagnosis, and apolipoprotein E ɛ4 status. Secondary models tested an LVEF x cognitive diagnosis interaction and then stratified by diagnosis (normal cognition (NC), mild cognitive impairment (MCI)).Results:Higher LVEF related to decreased CSF Aβ42 levels (β= -6.50, p = 0.04) reflecting greater cerebral amyloid accumulation, but this counterintuitive result was attenuated after excluding participants with cardiovascular disease and atrial fibrillation (p = 0.07). We observed an interaction between LVEF and cognitive diagnosis on CSF t-tau (p = 0.004) and p-tau levels (p = 0.002), whereas lower LVEF was associated with increased CSF t-tau (β= -9.74, p = 0.01) and p-tau in the NC (β= -1.41, p = 0.003) but not MCI participants (p-values>0.13).Conclusions:Among cognitively normal older adults, subclinically lower LVEF relates to greater molecular evidence of tau phosphorylation and neurodegeneration. Modest age-related changes in cardiovascular function may have implications for pathophysiological changes in the brain later in life.",32144980,PMC7278528,10.3233/JAD-190813,6
Molecular mechanisms of Alzheimer's disease: From therapeutic targets to promising drugs,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by cognitive impairment so widespread that it interferes with a person's ability to complete daily activities. AD is becoming increasingly common, and it is estimated that the number of patients will reach 152 million by 2050. Current treatment options for AD are symptomatic and have modest benefits. Therefore, considering the human, social, and economic burden of the disease, the development of drugs with the potential to alter disease progression has become a global priority. In this review, the molecular mechanisms involved in the pathology of AD were evaluated as therapeutic targets. The main aim of the review is to focus on new knowledge about mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, and neuronal transmission in AD, as well as a range of cellular signaling mechanisms and associated treatments. Important molecular interactions leading to AD were described in amyloid cascade and in tau protein function, oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, cholinergic and glutamatergic neurotransmission, cAMP-regulatory element-binding protein (CREB), the silent mating type information regulation 2 homolog 1 (SIRT-1), neuroinflammation (glial cells), and synaptic alterations. This review summarizes recent experimental and clinical research in AD pathology and analyzes the potential of therapeutic applications based on molecular disease mechanisms.",36576325,,10.1111/fcp.12861,2
Olfaction deterioration in cognitive disorders in the elderly,"Background:Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases are widespread neurodegenerative pathologies. Parkinson's disease affects about 1 % of the population over the age of 65 years, while Alzheimer is considered the most common cause of dementia, with an annual incidence of 1 % in persons aged 65 years. It has been demonstrated that both these neurodegenerative diseases are associated with smell dysfunction.Aim:The aim of the present review is to describe briefly modern olfactory evaluation tools as well as the importance of olfactory sensitivity screening in the elderly, especially where cognitive disorders, such as Alzheimer's or Parkinson's diseases, are suspected.Methods:A brief literature review focusing on the basic principle of smell tests is illustrated together with their application in elderly patients affected by cognitive disorders, in particular Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases.Results/conclusions:Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases are both neurodegenerative disorders typically found in the elderly. As both diseases are characterized by the early presence of dysosmia, simple validated smell tests could very well help clinicians in the early diagnosis of these neuropathological conditions. Elderly patients complaining of smell loss and found to be dysosmic, by means of validated olfactory tests, should be neurologically evaluated as early as possible to detect slight motor abnormalities in an at-risk population.",26003671,,10.1007/s40520-015-0380-x,23
"Cerebral hypoperfusion and glucose hypometabolism: Key pathophysiological modulators promote neurodegeneration, cognitive impairment, and Alzheimer's disease","Aging, hypertension, diabetes, hypoxia/obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), obesity, vitamin B12/folate deficiency, depression, and traumatic brain injury synergistically promote diverse pathological mechanisms including cerebral hypoperfusion and glucose hypometabolism. These risk factors trigger neuroinflammation and oxidative-nitrosative stress that in turn decrease nitric oxide and enhance endothelin, Amyloid-β deposition, cerebral amyloid angiopathy, and blood-brain barrier disruption. Proinflammatory cytokines, endothelin-1, and oxidative-nitrosative stress trigger several pathological feedforward and feedback loops. These upstream factors persist in the brain for decades, upregulating amyloid and tau, before the cognitive decline. These cascades lead to neuronal Ca2+increase, neurodegeneration, cognitive/memory decline, and Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, strategies are available to attenuate cerebral hypoperfusion and glucose hypometabolism and ameliorate cognitive decline. AD is the leading cause of dementia among the elderly. There is significant evidence that pathways involving inflammation and oxidative-nitrosative stress (ONS) play a key pathophysiological role in promoting cognitive dysfunction. Aging and several comorbid conditions mentioned above promote diverse pathologies. These include inflammation, ONS, hypoperfusion, and hypometabolism in the brain. In AD, chronic cerebral hypoperfusion and glucose hypometabolism precede decades before the cognitive decline. These comorbid disease conditions may share and synergistically activate these pathophysiological pathways. Inflammation upregulates cerebrovascular pathology through proinflammatory cytokines, endothelin-1, and nitric oxide (NO). Inflammation-triggered ONS promotes long-term damage involving fatty acids, proteins, DNA, and mitochondria; these amplify and perpetuate several feedforward and feedback pathological loops. The latter includes dysfunctional energy metabolism (compromised mitochondrial ATP production), amyloid-β generation, endothelial dysfunction, and blood-brain-barrier disruption. These lead to decreased cerebral blood flow and chronic cerebral hypoperfusion- that would modulate metabolic dysfunction and neurodegeneration. In essence, hypoperfusion deprives the brain from its two paramount trophic substances, viz., oxygen and nutrients. Consequently, the brain suffers from synaptic dysfunction and neuronal degeneration/loss, leading to both gray and white matter atrophy, cognitive dysfunction, and AD. This Review underscores the importance of treating the above-mentioned comorbid disease conditions to attenuate inflammation and ONS and ameliorate decreased cerebral blood flow and hypometabolism. Additionally, several strategies are described here to control chronic hypoperfusion of the brain and enhance cognition. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",27350397,,10.1002/jnr.23777,188
Iron neurochemistry in Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease: targets for therapeutics,"Brain iron homeostasis is increasingly recognized as a potential target for the development of drug therapies for aging-related disorders. Dysregulation of iron metabolism associated with cellular damage and oxidative stress is reported as a common event in several neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and Huntington's diseases. Indeed, many proteins initially characterized in those diseases such as amyloid-β protein, α-synuclein, and huntingtin have been linked to iron neurochemistry. Iron plays a crucial role in maintaining normal physiological functions in the brain through its participation in many cellular functions such as mitochondrial respiration, myelin synthesis, and neurotransmitter synthesis and metabolism. However, excess iron is a potent source of oxidative damage through radical formation and because of the lack of a body-wide export system, a tight regulation of its uptake, transport and storage is crucial in fulfilling cellular functions while keeping its level below the toxicity threshold. In this review, we discuss the current knowledge on iron homeostasis in the brain and explore how alterations in brain iron metabolism affect neuronal function with emphasis on iron dysregulation in Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. Finally, we discuss recent findings implicating iron as a diagnostic and therapeutic target for Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. Iron plays a fundamental role in maintaining the high metabolic and energetic requirements of the brain. However, iron has to be maintained in a delicate balance as both iron overload and iron deficiency are detrimental to the brain and can trigger neurodegeneration. Here, we discuss the current knowledge on brain iron homeostasis and its involvement in major aging-related neurodegenerative diseases. This article is part of a special issue on Parkinson disease.",26545340,,10.1111/jnc.13425,214
Toll-Like Receptor 4: A Promising Therapeutic Target for Alzheimer's Disease,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease that primarily manifests as memory deficits and cognitive impairment and has created health challenges for patients and society. In AD, amyloidβ-protein (Aβ) induces Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) activation in microglia. Activation of TLR4 induces downstream signaling pathways and promotes the generation of proinflammatory cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor-α(TNF-α), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and interleukin-1β(IL-1β), which also trigger the activation of astrocytes and influence amyloid-dependent neuronal death. Therefore, TLR4 may be an important molecular target for treating AD by regulating neuroinflammation. Moreover, TLR4 regulates apoptosis, autophagy, and gut microbiota and is closely related to AD. This article reviews the role of TLR4 in the pathogenesis of AD and a range of potential therapies targeting TLR4 for AD. Elucidating the regulatory mechanism of TLR4 in AD may provide valuable clues for developing new therapeutic strategies for AD.",36046763,PMC9420645,10.1155/2022/7924199,9
NeuroRDF: semantic integration of highly curated data to prioritize biomarker candidates in Alzheimer's disease,"Background:Neurodegenerative diseases are incurable and debilitating indications with huge social and economic impact, where much is still to be learnt about the underlying molecular events. Mechanistic disease models could offer a knowledge framework to help decipher the complex interactions that occur at molecular and cellular levels. This motivates the need for the development of an approach integrating highly curated and heterogeneous data into a disease model of different regulatory data layers. Although several disease models exist, they often do not consider the quality of underlying data. Moreover, even with the current advancements in semantic web technology, we still do not have cure for complex diseases like Alzheimer's disease. One of the key reasons accountable for this could be the increasing gap between generated data and the derived knowledge.Results:In this paper, we describe an approach, called as NeuroRDF, to develop an integrative framework for modeling curated knowledge in the area of complex neurodegenerative diseases. The core of this strategy lies in the usage of well curated and context specific data for integration into one single semantic web-based framework, RDF. This increases the probability of the derived knowledge to be novel and reliable in a specific disease context. This infrastructure integrates highly curated data from databases (Bind, IntAct, etc.), literature (PubMed), and gene expression resources (such as GEO and ArrayExpress). We illustrate the effectiveness of our approach by asking real-world biomedical questions that link these resources to prioritize the plausible biomarker candidates. Among the 13 prioritized candidate genes, we identified MIF to be a potential emerging candidate due to its role as a pro-inflammatory cytokine. We additionally report on the effort and challenges faced during generation of such an indication-specific knowledge base comprising of curated and quality-controlled data.Conclusion:Although many alternative approaches have been proposed and practiced for modeling diseases, the semantic web technology is a flexible and well established solution for harmonized aggregation. The benefit of this work, to use high quality and context specific data, becomes apparent in speculating previously unattended biomarker candidates around a well-known mechanism, further leveraged for experimental investigations.",27392431,PMC4939021,10.1186/s13326-016-0079-8,4
In vivo PET imaging of neuroinflammation in Alzheimer's disease,"Increasing evidence suggests that neuroinflammation contributes to the pathophysiology of many neurodegenerative diseases, especially Alzheimer's disease (AD). Molecular imaging by PET may be a useful tool to assess neuroinflammation in vivo, thus helping to decipher the complex role of inflammatory processes in the pathophysiology of neurodegenerative diseases and providing a potential means of monitoring the effect of new therapeutic approaches. For this objective, the main target of PET studies is the 18 kDa translocator protein (TSPO), as it is overexpressed by activated microglia. In the present review, we describe the most widely used PET tracers targeting the TSPO, the methodological issues in tracer quantification and summarize the results obtained by TSPO PET imaging in AD, as well as in neurodegenerative disorders associated with AD, in psychiatric disorders and ageing. We also briefly describe alternative PET targets and imaging modalities to study neuroinflammation. Lastly, we question the meaning of PET imaging data in the context of a highly complex and multifaceted role of neuroinflammation in neurodegenerative diseases. This overview leads to the conclusion that PET imaging of neuroinflammation is a promising way of deciphering the enigma of the pathophysiology of AD and of monitoring the effect of new therapies.",28516240,,10.1007/s00702-017-1731-x,33
The Amyloid Cascade Hypothesis in Alzheimer's Disease: Should We Change Our Thinking?,"Old age increases the risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common neurodegenerative disease, a devastating disorder of the human mind and the leading cause of dementia. Worldwide, 50 million people have the disease, and it is estimated that there will be 150 million by 2050. Today, healthcare for AD patients consumes 1% of the global economy. According to the amyloid cascade hypothesis, AD begins in the brain by accumulating and aggregating Aβ peptides and forming β-amyloid fibrils (Aβ42). However, in clinical trials, reducing Aβ peptide production and amyloid formation in the brain did not slow cognitive decline or improve daily life in AD patients. Prevention studies in cognitively unimpaired people at high risk or genetically destined to develop AD also have not slowed cognitive decline. These observations argue against the amyloid hypothesis of AD etiology, its development, and disease mechanisms. Here, we look at other avenues in the research of AD, such as the presenilin hypothesis, synaptic glutamate signaling, and the role of astrocytes and the glutamate transporter EAAT2 in the development of AD.",36979388,PMC10046826,10.3390/biom13030453,9
Using Big Data to Uncover Association Between Sildenafil Use and Reduced Risk of Alzheimer's Disease,"Alzheimer's disease is a chronic neurodegenerative disease with multiple pathogenesis pathways. Sildenafil, one of the phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors, was proven to have effective benefits in transgenic Alzheimer's disease mice. The purpose of the study was to investigate the relationship between sildenafil use and the risk of Alzheimer's disease based on the IBM® MarketScan® Database covering over 30 million employees and family members per year. Sildenafil and non-sildenafil-matched cohorts were generated using propensity-score matching with the greedy nearest-neighbor algorithm. The propensity score stratified univariate analysis and the Cox regression model showed that sildenafil use was significantly associated with a 60% risk reduction of developing Alzheimer's disease (HR=0.40; 95%CI:0.38-0.44; P<.0001) compared to the cohort of individuals who did not take sildenafil. Sex-stratified analyses revealed that sildenafil was related to a lower risk of Alzheimer's disease in subgroups of both males and females. Our findings demonstrated a significant association between sildenafil use and a lower risk of Alzheimer's disease.",37203519,,10.3233/SHTI230291,2
Photobiomodulation for Neurodegenerative Diseases: A Scoping Review,"Neurodegenerative diseases involve the progressive dysfunction and loss of neurons in the central nervous system and thus present a significant challenge due to the absence of effective therapies for halting or reversing their progression. Based on the characteristics of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD), which have prolonged incubation periods and protracted courses, exploring non-invasive physical therapy methods is essential for alleviating such diseases and ensuring that patients have an improved quality of life. Photobiomodulation (PBM) uses red and infrared light for therapeutic benefits and functions by stimulating, healing, regenerating, and protecting organizations at risk of injury, degradation, or death. Over the last two decades, PBM has gained widespread recognition as a non-invasive physical therapy method, showing efficacy in pain relief, anti-inflammatory responses, and tissue regeneration. Its application has expanded into the fields of neurology and psychiatry, where extensive research has been conducted. This paper presents a review and evaluation of studies investigating PBM in neurodegenerative diseases, with a specific emphasis on recent applications in AD and PD treatment for both animal and human subjects. Molecular mechanisms related to neuron damage and cognitive impairment are scrutinized, offering valuable insights into PBM's potential as a non-invasive therapeutic strategy.",38338901,PMC10855709,10.3390/ijms25031625,1
"The Role of Amyloid-β, Tau, and α-Synuclein Proteins as Putative Blood Biomarkers in Patients with Cerebral Amyloid Angiopathy","Background:Cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) is a cerebrovascular disorder characterized by the deposition of amyloid-β protein (Aβ) within brain blood vessels that develops in elderly people and Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients. Therefore, the investigation of biomarkers able to differentiate CAA patients from AD patients and healthy controls (HC) is of great interest, in particular in peripheral fluids.Objective:The current study aimed to detect the neurodegenerative disease (ND)-related protein (i.e., Aβ1-40, Aβ1-42, tau, and α-synuclein) levels in both red blood cells (RBCs) and plasma of CAA patients and HC, evaluating their role as putative peripheral biomarkers for CAA.Methods:For this purpose, the proteins' concentration was quantified in RBCs and plasma by homemade immunoenzymatic assays in an exploratory cohort of 20 CAA patients and 20 HC.Results:The results highlighted a significant increase of Aβ1-40 and α-synuclein concentrations in both RBCs and plasma of CAA patients, while higher Aβ1-42 and t-tau levels were detected only in RBCs of CAA individuals compared to HC. Moreover, Aβ1-42/Aβ1-40 ratio increased in RBCs and decreased in plasma of CAA patients. The role of these proteins as candidate peripheral biomarkers easily measurable with a blood sample in CAA needs to be confirmed in larger studies.Conclusion:In conclusion, we provide evidence concerning the possible use of blood biomarkers for contributing to CAA diagnosis and differentiation from other NDs.",35964181,,10.3233/JAD-220216,1
Loss of gait control assessed by cognitive-motor dual-tasks: pros and cons in detecting people at risk of developing Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases,"Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases are age-related progressive neurodegenerative diseases of increasing prevalence worldwide. In the absence of curative therapy, current research is interested in prevention, by identifying subtle signs of early-stage neurodegeneration. Today, the field of behavioral neuroscience has emerged as one of the most promising areas of research on this topic. Recently, it has been shown that the exacerbation of gait disorders under dual-task conditions (i.e., simultaneous performance of cognitive and motor tasks) could be a characteristic feature of Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. The cognitive-motor dual-task paradigm during walking allows to assess whether (i) executive attention is abnormally impaired in prodromal Alzheimer's disease or (ii) compensation strategies are used in order to preserve gait function when the basal ganglia system is altered in prodromal Parkinson's disease. This review aims at (i) identifying patterns of dual-task-related gait changes that are specific to Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases, respectively, (ii) demonstrating that these changes could potentially be used as prediagnostic markers for disease onset, (iii) reviewing pros and cons of existing dual-task studies, and (iv) proposing future directions for clinical research.",28551877,PMC5505895,10.1007/s11357-017-9977-7,38
Moving from the Dish to the Clinical Practice: A Decade of Lessons and Perspectives from the Pre-Clinical and Clinical Stem Cell Studies for Alzheimer's Disease,"To date, there is no definitive treatment for Alzheimer's disease (AD). The realm of stem cells is very promising in regenerative medicine, particularly neurodegenerative disorders. Various types of stem cells have been used in multiple trials on AD models, trying to find an innovative management of this disease. In this systematic review, we trace the published preclinical and clinical data throughout the last decade, to show how much knowledge we gained so far in this field and the future perspectives of stem cells in AD treatment.",27392861,,10.3233/JAD-160250,3
Oncogenic Pathways in Neurodegenerative Diseases,"Cancer and neurodegenerative diseases are two of the leading causes of premature death in modern societies. Their incidence continues to increase, and in the near future, it is believed that cancer will kill more than 20 million people per year, and neurodegenerative diseases, due to the aging of the world population, will double their prevalence. The onset and the progression of both diseases are defined by dysregulation of the same molecular signaling pathways. However, whereas in cancer, these alterations lead to cell survival and proliferation, neurodegenerative diseases trigger cell death and apoptosis. The study of the mechanisms underlying these opposite final responses to the same molecular trigger is key to providing a better understanding of the diseases and finding more accurate treatments. Here, we review the ten most common signaling pathways altered in cancer and analyze them in the context of different neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's (AD), Parkinson's (PD), and Huntington's (HD) diseases.",35328644,PMC8952192,10.3390/ijms23063223,7
Hepta-Histidine Inhibits Tau Aggregation,"Tau aggregation is a central hallmark of tauopathies such as frontotemporal lobar degeneration and progressive supranuclear palsy as well as of Alzheimer's disease, and it has been a target for therapeutic development. Herein, we unexpectedly found that hepta-histidine (7H), an inhibitor of the interaction between Ku70 and Huntingtin proteins, suppresses aggregation of Tau-R3 peptidesin vitro. Addition of the trans-activator of transcription (TAT) sequence (YGRKKRRQRRR) derived from the TAT protein to 7H increased its permeability into cells, and TAT-7H treatment of iPS cell-derived neurons carrying Tau or APP mutations suppressed Tau phosphorylation. These results indicate that 7H is a promising lead compound for developing anti-aggregation drugs against Tau-related neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's disease (AD).",34319089,,10.1021/acschemneuro.1c00164,4
[Neurodegenerative diseases],"Neurodegenerative diseases are sporadic and rare hereditary disorders of the central nervous system, which cause a slowly progressive loss of function of specific neuron populations and their connections. Severe impairments and care dependency can be the sequelae. Neurodegenerative disorders are diseases of older people; therefore, the demographic shift leads to an increase in the number of affected patients. Radiologists will also become more involved. For this reason important neurodegenerative diseases are presented in this article. In addition to Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases these also include frontotemporal lobar degeneration, Lewy body dementia, vascular dementia, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease and Huntington's chorea. The clinical symptoms and diagnostics are described, whereby the focus lies on typical results of morphological imaging.",29511772,,10.1007/s00117-018-0363-y,15
"Brain aging, Alzheimer's disease, and the role of stem cells in primate comparative studies","Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease that is ultimately fatal. Currently, millions of Americans are living with AD, and this number is predicted to grow with increases in the aging population. Interestingly, despite the prevalence of AD in human populations, the full AD phenotype has not been observed in any nonhuman primate (NHP) species, and it has been suggested that NHPs are immune to neurodegenerative diseases such as AD. Here, we review the typical age-related changes and pathologies in humans along with the neuropathologic changes associated with AD, and we place this information in the context of the comparative neuropathology of NHPs. We further propose the use of induced pluripotent stem cell technology as a way of addressing initial molecular processes and changes that occur in neurons and glia (in both humans and NHPs) when exposed to AD-inducing pathology prior to cell death.",35929189,,10.1002/cne.25394,2
How Can Static and Oscillating Electric Fields Serve in Decomposing Alzheimer's and Other Senile Plaques?,"Alzheimer's disease is one of the most common neurodegenerative conditions, which are ascribed to extracellular accumulation of β-amyloid peptides into plaques. This phenomenon seems to typify other related neurodegenerative diseases. The present study uses classical molecular-dynamics simulations to decipher the aggregation-disintegration behavior of β-amyloid peptide plaques in the presence of static and oscillating oriented external electric fields (OEEFs). A long-term disintegration of such plaques is highly desirable since this may improve the prospects of therapeutic treatments of Alzheimer's disease and of other neurodegenerative diseases typified by senile plaques. Our study illustrates the spontaneous aggregation of the β-amyloid, its prevention and breakdown when OEEF is applied, and the fate of the broken aggregate when the OEEF is removed. Notably, we demonstrate that the usage of an oscillating OEEF on β-amyloid aggregates appears to lead to an irreversible disintegration. Insight is provided into the root causes of the various modes of aggregation, as well as into the different fates of OEEF-induced disintegration in oscillating vs static fields. Finally, our simulation results are compared to the well-established TTFields and the Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) therapies, which are currently used options for treatments of Alzheimer's disease and other related neurodegenerative diseases.",36735972,PMC9936589,10.1021/jacs.2c12305,4
The relationship of early- and late-onset Alzheimer's disease genes with COVID-19,"Individuals with Alzheimer's disease and other neurodegenerative diseases have been exposed to excess risk by the COVID-19 pandemic. COVID-19's main manifestations include high body temperature, dry cough, and exhaustion. Nevertheless, some affected individuals may have an atypical presentation at diagnosis but suffer neurological signs and symptoms as the first disease manifestation. These findings collectively show the neurotropic nature of SARS-CoV-2 virus and its ability to involve the central nervous system. In addition, Alzheimer's disease and COVID-19 has a number of common risk factors and comorbid conditions including age, sex, hypertension, diabetes, and the expression of APOE ε4. Until now, a plethora of studies have examined the COVID-19 disease but only a few studies has yet examined the relationship of COVID-19 and Alzheimer's disease as risk factors of each other. This review emphasizes the recently published evidence on the role of the genes of early- or late-onset Alzheimer's disease in the susceptibility of individuals currently suffering or recovered from COVID-19 to Alzheimer's disease or in the susceptibility of individuals at risk of or with Alzheimer's disease to COVID-19 or increased COVID-19 severity and mortality. Furthermore, the present review also draws attention to other uninvestigated early- and late-onset Alzheimer's disease genes to elucidate the relationship between this multifactorial disease and COVID-19.",35429259,PMC9012910,10.1007/s00702-022-02499-0,5
Circadian alterations in patients with neurodegenerative diseases: Neuropathological basis of underlying network mechanisms,"Circadian organization of physiology and behavior is an important biological process that allows organisms to anticipate and prepare for daily changes and demands. Disruptions in this system precipitates a wide range of health issues. In patients with neurodegenerative diseases, alterations of circadian rhythms are among the most common and debilitating symptoms. Although a growing awareness of these symptoms has occurred during the last decade, their underlying neuropathophysiological circuitry remains poorly understood and consequently no effective therapeutic strategies are available to alleviate these health issues. Recent studies have examined the neuropathological status of the different neural components of the circuitry governing the generation of circadian rhythms in neurodegenerative diseases. In this review, we will dissect the potential contribution of dysfunctions in the different nodes of this circuitry to circadian alterations in patients with neurodegenerative diseases. A deeper understanding of these mechanisms will provide not only a better understanding of disease neuro-pathophysiology, but also hold the promise for developing effective and mechanisms-based therapies.",32736083,,10.1016/j.nbd.2020.105029,16
The role of gut microbiota in pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease,"This paper describes the effects of the gut microbiota on the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's pathology by evaluating the current original key findings and identifying gaps in the knowledge required for validation. The diversity of the gut microbiota declines in the elderly and in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Restoring the diversity with probiotic treatment alleviates the psychiatric and histopathological findings. This presents a problem: How does gut microbiota interact with the pathogenesis of AD? The starting point of this comprehensive review is addressing the role of bacterial metabolites and neurotransmitters in the brain under various conditions, ranging from a healthy state to ageing and disease. In the light of current literature, we describe three different linkages between the present gut microbiome hypothesis and the other major theories for the pathogenesis of AD as follows: bacterial metabolites and amyloids can trigger central nervous system inflammation and cerebrovascular degeneration; impaired gut microbiome flora inhibits the autophagy-mediated protein clearance process; and gut microbiomes can change the neurotransmitter levels in the brain through the vagal afferent fibres.",30920075,,10.1111/jam.14264,60
Bioinorganic Chemistry of Micronutrients Related to Alzheimer's and Parkinson's Diseases,"Metal ions are fundamental to guarantee the regular physiological activity of the human organism. Similarly, vitamins play a key role in many biological functions of the metabolism, among which are coenzymes, redox mediators, and antioxidants. Due to their importance in the human organism, both metals and vitamins have been extensively studied for their involvement in neurodegenerative diseases (NDs). However, the full potential of the interaction between vitamins and metal ions has not been fully explored by researchers yet, and further investigation on this topic is needed. The aim of this review is to provide an overview of the scientific literature on the implications of vitamins and selected metal ions in two of the most common neurodegenerative diseases, Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease. Furthermore, vitamin-metal ion interactions are discussed in detail focusing on their bioinorganic chemistry, with the perspective of arousing more interest in this fascinating bioinorganic field.",37513339,PMC10385134,10.3390/molecules28145467,3
"Psychosis in Alzheimer disease - mechanisms, genetics and therapeutic opportunities","Psychosis is a common and distressing symptom in people with Alzheimer disease, and few safe and effective treatments are available. However, new approaches to symptom assessment and treatment are beginning to drive the field forward. New nosological perspectives have been provided by incorporating the emergence of psychotic symptoms in older adults - even in advance of dementia - into epidemiological and neurobiological frameworks as well as into diagnostic and research criteria such as the International Psychogeriatric Association criteria for psychosis in neurocognitive disorders, the Alzheimer's Association International Society to Advance Alzheimer's Research and Treatment (ISTAART) research criteria for psychosis in neurodegenerative disease, and the ISTAART criteria for mild behavioural impairment. Here, we highlight the latest findings in genomics, neuroimaging and neurobiology that are informing approaches to drug discovery and repurposing. Current pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatment options are discussed, with a focus on safety and precision medicine. We also explore trial data for pimavanserin, a novel agent that shows promise for the treatment of psychosis in people with dementia, and discuss existing agents that might be useful but need further exploration such as escitalopram, lithium, cholinesterase inhibitors and vitamin D. Although the assessment and management of psychosis in people with dementia remain challenging, new opportunities are providing direction and hope to the field.",34983978,PMC9074132,10.1038/s41582-021-00597-3,32
Identification of image genetic biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease by orthogonal structured sparse canonical correlation analysis based on a diagnostic information fusion,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an irreversible neurodegenerative disease, and its incidence increases yearly. Because AD patients will have cognitive impairment and personality changes, it has caused a heavy burden on the family and society. Image genetics takes the structure and function of the brain as a phenotype and studies the influence of genetic variation on the structure and function of the brain. Based on the structural magnetic resonance imaging data and transcriptome data of AD and healthy control samples in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Disease database, this paper proposed the use of an orthogonal structured sparse canonical correlation analysis for diagnostic information fusion algorithm. The algorithm added structural constraints to the region of interest (ROI) of the brain. Integrating the diagnostic information of samples can improve the correlation performance between samples. The results showed that the algorithm could extract the correlation between the two modal data and discovered the brain regions most affected by multiple risk genes and their biological significance. In addition, we also verified the diagnostic significance of risk ROIs and risk genes for AD. The code of the proposed algorithm is available at https://github.com/Wanguangyu111/OSSCCA-DIF.",37920027,,10.3934/mbe.2023741,0
Uncovering the Neural Bases of Cognitive and Affective Empathy Deficits in Alzheimer's Disease and the Behavioral-Variant of Frontotemporal Dementia,"Loss of empathy is a core presenting feature of the behavioral-variant of frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD), resulting in socioemotional difficulties and behavioral transgressions. In contrast, interpersonal functioning remains relatively intact in Alzheimer's disease (AD), despite marked cognitive decline. The neural substrates mediating these patterns of loss and sparing in social functioning remain unclear, yet are relevant for our understanding of the social brain. We investigated cognitive versus affective aspects of empathy using the Interpersonal Reactivity Index (IRI) in 25 AD and 24 bvFTD patients and contrasted their performance with 22 age- and education-matched controls. Cognitive empathy was comparably compromised in AD and bvFTD, whereas affective empathy was impaired exclusively in bvFTD. While controlling for overall cognitive dysfunction ameliorated perspective-taking deficits in AD, empathy loss persisted across cognitive and affective domains in bvFTD. Voxel-based morphometry analyses revealed divergent neural substrates of empathy loss in each patient group. Perspective-taking deficits correlated with predominantly left-sided temporoparietal atrophy in AD, whereas widespread bilateral frontoinsular, temporal, parietal, and occipital atrophy was implicated in bvFTD. Reduced empathic concern in bvFTD was associated with atrophy in the left orbitofrontal, inferior frontal, and insular cortices, and the bilateral mid-cingulate gyrus. Our findings suggest that social cognitive deficits in AD arise largely as a consequence of global cognitive dysfunction, rather than a loss of empathy per se. In contrast, loss of empathy in bvFTD reflects the deterioration of a distributed network of frontoinsular and temporal structures that appear crucial for monitoring and processing social information.",27258418,,10.3233/JAD-160175,57
'Eye-Tracking' with Words for Alzheimer's Disease Detection: Time Alignment of Words Enunciation with Image Regions During Image Description Tasks,"Background:Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease that results in cognitive decline, dementia, and eventually death. Diagnosing early signs of AD can help clinicians to improve the quality of life.Objective:We developed a non-invasive approach to help neurologists and clinicians to distinguish probable AD patients and healthy controls (HC).Methods:The patients' gaze points were followed based on the words they used to describe the Cookie Theft (CT) picture description task. We hypothesized that the timing of words enunciation aligns with the participant's eye movements. The moments that each word was spoken were then aligned with specific regions of the image. We then applied machine learning algorithms to classify probable AD and HC. We randomly selected 60 participants (30 AD and 30 HC) from the Dementia Bank (Pitt Corpus).Results:Five main classifiers were applied to different features extracted from the recorded audio and participants' transcripts (AD and HC). Support vector machine and logistic regression had the highest accuracy (up to 80% and 78.33%, respectively) in three different experiments.Conclusions:In conclusion, point-of-gaze can be applied as a non-invasive and less expensive approach compared to other available methods (e.g., eye tracker devices) for early-stage AD diagnosis.",37661875,,10.3233/JAD-220711,0
Tau PET imaging: present and future directions,"Abnormal aggregation of tau in the brain is a major contributing factor in various neurodegenerative diseases. The role of tau phosphorylation in the pathophysiology of tauopathies remains unclear. Consequently, it is important to be able to accurately and specifically target tau deposits in vivo in the brains of patients. The advances of molecular imaging in the recent years have now led to the recent development of promising tau-specific tracers for positron emission tomography (PET), such as THK5317, THK5351, AV-1451, and PBB3. These tracers are now available for clinical assessment in patients with various tauopathies, including Alzheimer's disease, as well as in healthy subjects. Exploring the patterns of tau deposition in vivo for different pathologies will allow discrimination between neurodegenerative diseases, including different tauopathies, and monitoring of disease progression. The variety and complexity of the different types of tau deposits in the different diseases, however, has resulted in quite a challenge for the development of tau PET tracers. Extensive work remains in order to fully characterize the binding properties of the tau PET tracers, and to assess their usefulness as an early biomarker of the underlying pathology. In this review, we summarize recent findings on the most promising tau PET tracers to date, discuss what has been learnt from these findings, and offer some suggestions for the next steps that need to be achieved in a near future.",28219440,PMC5319037,10.1186/s13024-017-0162-3,134
Role of Inflammasomes in Neuroimmune and Neurodegenerative Diseases: A Systematic Review,"Inflammasomes are multiprotein complexes that can sense pathogen-associated molecular patterns and damage-associated molecular signals. They are involved in the initiation and development of inflammation via activation of IL-1βand IL-18. Many recent studies suggest a strong correlation between inflammasomes and neurological diseases, such as multiple sclerosis (MS), Alzheimer's disease (AD), and Parkinson's disease (PD). Several components of inflammasomes, such as nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain- (NOD-) like receptor, absent in melanoma 2- (AIM2-) like receptors (ALRs), apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a caspase recruitment domain (ASC), and caspase-1, as well as the upstream factors and downstream effectors, are associated with the initiation and development of MS and its animal model, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. Additionally, inflammasomes affect the efficacy of interferon-βtherapy in patients with MS. Finally, the strong association of inflammasomes with AD and PD needs to be further studied. In this review of latest literatures, we comprehensively tease out diverse roles of different kinds of inflammasomes in neuroimmune and neurodegenerative diseases, especially in the perspective of double roles involved in pathogenesis, and identify future research priorities.",29849483,PMC5932495,10.1155/2018/1549549,33
A 19-Year-Old Adolescent with Probable Alzheimer's Disease,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) primarily affects older adults. In this report, we present the case of a 19-year-old male with gradual memory decline for 2 years and World Health Organization-University of California Los Angeles Auditory Verbal Learning Test (WHO-UCLA AVLT) results also showing memory impairment. Positron emission tomography-magnetic resonance imaging with 18F fluorodeoxyglucose revealed atrophy of the bilateral hippocampus and hypometabolism in the bilateral temporal lobe. Examination of the patient's cerebrospinal fluid showed an increased concentration of p-tau181 and a decreased amyloid-β 42/40 ratio. However, through whole-genome sequencing, no known gene mutations were identified. Considering the above, the patient was diagnosed with probable AD.",36565128,,10.3233/JAD-221065,7
Feature Extraction and Identification of Alzheimer's Disease based on Latent Factor of Multi-Channel EEG,"Alzheimer's disease is a neurodegenerative disease in old age, early diagnosis will help to delay the progression of the disease. Presently, the features of brain functional diseases can be obtained with EEG analysis, but the relationship between characteristics of EEG and Alzheimer's disease has not been clearly clarified. In this work, we hypothesize that there exist default brain variables (latent factors) across subjects in disease processes, decoding latent factor from brain activity contributes to the study of cognitive impairment. To that end, this work proposes to extract characteristics of Alzheimer's disease by combing latent factors of EEG with variational auto-encoder to realize disease identification. Primarily, power spectrum characteristics is investigated and it is found that the dominant frequency of two groups is different. Further analysis reveals that latent factor distribution of Alzheimer's disease exists obvious differences with normal group in the theta frequency band. Moreover, the latent factors are projected onto the three-dimensional state space and the transient rotation of neural state is found, which shows the dynamic characteristics of latent factors. In addition, Takagi-Sugeno-Kang classifier is adopted and multiple latent factors are fed into Takagi-Sugeno-Kang classifier for decoding. Compared with linear classifier, Takagi-Sugeno-Kang fuzzy classifier has better performance in classification of energy feature from sub-frequency bands of latent factors. The accuracy of identification could up to 98.10% when the combination of energy features of four frequency bands is used as model input. Collectively, this work provides a feasible tool for identification of neurological dysfunction from the view of latent factors, especially contributing to the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease.",34329166,,10.1109/TNSRE.2021.3101240,6
The Emerging Role of Autophagy-Associated lncRNAs in the Pathogenesis of Neurodegenerative Diseases,"Neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs) have become a significant global public health problem and a major societal burden. The World Health Organization predicts that NDDs will overtake cancer as the second most common cause of human mortality within 20 years. Thus, it is urgently important to identify pathogenic and diagnostic molecular markers related to neurodegenerative processes. Autophagy is a powerful process for removing aggregate-prone proteins in neurons; defects in autophagy are often associated with the pathogenesis of NDDs. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been suggested as key regulators in neurodevelopment; aberrant regulation of lncRNAs contributes to neurological disorders. In this review, we summarize the recent progress in the study of lncRNAs and autophagy in the context of neurodegenerative disorders, especially Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD). The information presented here should provide guidance for future in-depth investigations of neurodegenerative processes and related diagnostic molecular markers and treatment targets.",37298636,PMC10254068,10.3390/ijms24119686,2
O-GlcNAcylation: A regulator of tau pathology and neurodegeneration,"O-GlcNAcylation is the posttranslational modification of intracellular proteins by O-linked β-N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc). The discovery of O-GlcNAc modification of tau and its impact on tau phosphorylation has attracted recent research interest in O-GlcNAc studies in the Alzheimer's disease (AD) field. Modification of proteins by O-GlcNAc occurs extensively in the brain. The expressions and activities of the enzymes catalyzing O-GlcNAc cycling are several-fold higher in the brain than in the peripheral tissues. The O-GlcNAcylation levels of brain proteins including tau are decreased in AD brain, probably due to decreased brain glucose metabolism. The reduction of brain O-GlcNAcylation appears to mediate the molecular mechanism by which decreased brain glucose metabolism contributes to neurodegeneration. Studies on mouse models of tauopathies suggest a neuroprotective role of pharmacological elevation of brain O-GlcNAc, which could potentially be a promising approach for treating AD and other neurodegenerative diseases.",27126545,,10.1016/j.jalz.2016.02.011,36
The Correlation between Diabetes Mellitus and Neurodegenerative Diseases,"Today there is no longer any doubt that diabetes mellitus is associated with cognitive impairment and neurodegenerative diseases. The two most common forms of diabetes mellitus are type 1 and type 2. Type 1 diabetes mellitus is characterized by an absolute insulin deficiency that is associated with a large number of metabolic changes. This type of diabetes requires insulin therapy. Without insulin, this disease is fatal. The far more common form of diabetes mellitus nowadays is type 2 diabetes mellitus. It is characterized by insulin resistance. For a number of years drugs have been available that can be used to treat this form of diabetes in a multimodal manner. These therapy options can not only improve metabolic control, but also prevent cardiovascular events. Different cognitive alterations associated with diabetes mellitus can be distinguished. On the one hand, the change in glucose homeostasis itself leads to cognitive alterations, i.e. blood sugar levels that are too high or acutely too low are regularly associated with significant impairments in mental performance, including loss of consciousness. But not only the momentary blood sugar levels, but also long-term changes in glucose metabolism might lead to neurodegeneration and even dementia in a way that has not yet been fully understood. Insulin or insulin-like molecules have important effects in the central nervous system. In the last decades, it has been shown that insulin receptors themselves are expressed in many regions of the brain and e.g. regulate food intake and memory formation in humans and in animal models. In the animal model, disturbances in insulin signal transduction influence the development of pathologies typical of Alzheimer's disease (AD). In humans, central insulin resistance is at least part of the formal pathogenesis of AD. Vascular changes (macroangiopathy) in patients with diabetes mellitus often lead to cerebral insults, microangiopathies and vascular dementia.",36626931,,10.1055/a-2009-9755,2
The Therapeutic Potential of Mitochondria Transplantation Therapy in Neurodegenerative and Neurovascular Disorders,"Neurodegenerative and neurovascular disorders affect millions of people worldwide and account for a large and increasing health burden on the general population. Thus, there is a critical need to identify potential disease-modifying treatments that can prevent or slow the disease progression. Mitochondria are highly dynamic organelles and play an important role in energy metabolism and redox homeostasis, and mitochondrial dysfunction threatens cell homeostasis, perturbs energy production, and ultimately leads to cell death and diseases. Impaired mitochondrial function has been linked to the pathogenesis of several human neurological disorders. Given the significant contribution of mitochondrial dysfunction in neurological disorders, there has been considerable interest in developing therapies that can attenuate mitochondrial abnormalities and proffer neuroprotective effects. Unfortunately, therapies that target specific components of mitochondria or oxidative stress pathways have exhibited limited translatability. To this end, mitochondrial transplantation therapy (MTT) presents a new paradigm of therapeutic intervention, which involves the supplementation of healthy mitochondria to replace the damaged mitochondria for the treatment of neurological disorders. Prior studies demonstrated that the supplementation of healthy donor mitochondria to damaged neurons promotes neuronal viability, activity, and neurite growth and has been shown to provide benefits for neural and extra-neural diseases. In this review, we discuss the significance of mitochondria and summarize an overview of the recent advances and development of MTT in neurodegenerative and neurovascular disorders, particularly Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, and stroke. The significance of MTT is emerging as they meet a critical need to develop a diseasemodifying intervention for neurodegenerative and neurovascular disorders.",36089791,PMC10286589,10.2174/1570159X05666220908100545,2
Uncovering the Role of the Methylome in Dementia and Neurodegeneration,"Our understanding of the epigenome has advanced dramatically over the past decade, particularly in terms of DNA methylation, a modification found throughout the genome. Studies of the brain and neurons have outlined an increasingly complex architecture involving not just CG dinucleotide methylation but also methylation of other dinucleotides, and modifications of methylated bases such as 5-hydroxymethylcytosine. Different modifications may play an important role in brain development, function and decline; recent descriptions of the effects of aging and neurodegenerative processes such as Alzheimer disease on methylation profiles have ushered in an era of DNA methylome-wide association studies. Rapidly improving technologies and study designs are returning robust results, and investigations of the human brain's epigenome are increasingly feasible, complementing insights gained from genetic studies.",27423266,,10.1016/j.molmed.2016.06.008,13
Advances in prodrug design for Alzheimer's disease: the state of the art,"Introduction:Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex and multifactorial neurodegenerative disease that remains today a challenge for drug discovery. Like many pathologies of the central nervous system, one of the first hurdle is the development of a compound with a sufficient brain exposure to ensure a potential therapeutic benefit. In this direction, the development of prodrugs has been an intense field of research in the last years.Areas covered:Two main strategies of prodrugs development are analyzed in this review. First, the application of the classical modulation of an active compound to incorporate a promoiety has been exemplified in the field of AD. In a second chapter, a series of innovative prodrugs based on a polypharmacological approach is described to take into account the complexity of AD.Expert opinion:In the past 10 years, prodrugs have been approved by the FDA for the treatment of CNS pathologies. Most of them have been developed in order to improve membrane permeability of the parent drugs. Facing the limitation of AD drug discovery, the development of prodrugs will likely play a central role in the next years with the rise of innovative pleiotropic prodrugs.",35089846,,10.1080/17460441.2022.2031972,0
Resistance to autosomal dominant Alzheimer's disease in an APOE3 Christchurch homozygote: a case report,"We identified a PSEN1 (presenilin 1) mutation carrier from the world's largest autosomal dominant Alzheimer's disease kindred, who did not develop mild cognitive impairment until her seventies, three decades after the expected age of clinical onset. The individual had two copies of the APOE3 Christchurch (R136S) mutation, unusually high brain amyloid levels and limited tau and neurodegenerative measurements. Our findings have implications for the role of APOE in the pathogenesis, treatment and prevention of Alzheimer's disease.",31686034,PMC6898984,10.1038/s41591-019-0611-3,213
Neurodegenerative Patterns of Cognitive Clusters of Early-Onset Alzheimer's Disease Subjects: Evidence for Disease Heterogeneity,"Background/aims:Alzheimer's disease (AD) with onset before 65 (early-onset AD [EOAD]) occurs in approximately 6% of cases and can affect nonmemory domains. Here, we analyze patterns of impairment in amnestic EOAD individuals using data-driven statistical analyses.Methods:Cognitive data of 146 EOAD subjects were Z-normalized to 395 cognitively normal (CN) individuals. Domain-averaged Z-scores were adjusted for age, sex, and education followed by Wald cluster analysis of residuals. Magnetic resonance imaging and positron emission tomography comparisons of EOAD clusters to age-matched CN were done using Statistic Parametric Mapping 8. Cluster-level-family-wise error (p < 0.05) correction was applied. Mixed-effect models were used to compute longitudinal change across clusters.Results:Scree plot using the pseudo-T-squared suggested a 4-cluster solution. Cluster 1 (memory-predominant impairment) showed atrophy/hypometabolism in medial/lateral temporal, lateral parietal, and posterior cingulate regions. Cluster 2 (memory/visuospatial-predominant) showed atrophy/hypometabolism of medial temporal, temporoparietal, and frontal cortices. Cluster 3 (memory, language, and executive function) and Cluster 4 (globally impaired) manifested atrophy and hypometabolism throughout the brain. Longitudinally between-cluster differences in the visuospatial and language/executive domains were significant, suggesting phenotypic variation.Conclusion:We observed significant heterogeneity in cognitive presentation among amnestic EOAD subjects and patterns of atrophy/hypometabolism in each cluster in agreement with the observed cognitive phenotype.",31901905,PMC7031037,10.1159/000504341,4
Neuroinflammatory responses in Alzheimer's disease,"Neuroinflammatory responses in Alzheimer's disease (AD) are complex and not fully understood. They involve various cellular and molecular players and associate interaction between the central nervous system (CNS) and the periphery. Amyloid peptides within the senile plaques and abnormally phosphorylated tau in neurofibrillary tangles are able to initiate inflammatory responses, in brain of AD patients and in mouse models of this disease. The outcome of these responses on the pathophysiology of AD depends on several factors and can be either beneficial or detrimental. Thus, understanding the role of neuroinflammation in AD could help to develop safer and more efficient therapeutic strategies. This review discusses recent knowledge on microglia responses toward amyloid and tau pathology in AD, focusing on the role of Toll-like receptors and NOD-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome activation in microglial cells.",29273951,,10.1007/s00702-017-1831-7,61
Therapeutic targeting of microtubule affinity-regulating kinase 4 in cancer and neurodegenerative diseases,"Microtubule affinity-regulating kinase 4 (MARK4) is a member of the Ser/Thr protein kinase family, phosphorylates the microtubule-connected proteins and plays a vital role in causing cancers and neurodegenerative diseases. This kinase modulates multiple signaling pathways, including mammalian target of rapamycin, nuclear factor-κB, and Hippo-signaling, presumably responsible for cancer and Alzheimer's. MARK4 acts as a negative controller of the Hippo-kinase cassette for promoting YAP/TAZ action, and the loss of MARK4 detains the tumorigenic properties of cancer cells. MARK4 is involved in tau hyperphosphorylation that consequently affects neurodegeneration. MARK4 is a promising drug target for cancer, diabetes, and Alzheimer's. Developing the potent and selective inhibitors of MAKR4 are promising in the therapeutic management of associated diseases. Despite its great significance, a few reviews are available to discuss its structure, function and clinical significance. In the current review, we aimed to provide detailed information on the structural features of MARK4 targeted in drug development and its role in various signaling pathways related to cancer and neurodegenerative diseases. We further described the therapeutic potential of MARK4 inhibitors in preventing numerous diseases. Finally, the updated information on MARK4 will be helpful in the further development of effective therapeutic molecules.",37661636,,10.1002/jcb.30468,2
Brain comorbidities in normal pressure hydrocephalus,"Background and purpose:This cross-sectional study aims to compare gait changes after the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) tap test between normal pressure hydrocephalus patients with and without brain comorbidities (NPH+ and NPH- respectively) and then to identify significant contributors to a poor CSF tap test amongst individuals with NPH+.Methods:Gait changes (during the single task and the dual task of backward counting) were quantified before and 24 h after the CSF tap test with an optoelectronic system in 52 NPH patients (77.4 ± 6.0 years; 34.6% women). Changes after the CSF tap test in stride time variability (STV, %) were our main outcome. CSF Alzheimer's disease biomarkers, cerebrovascular white matter changes assessed with brain imaging and neurodegenerative diseases with parkinsonian syndrome represented the three individual brain comorbidities.Results:Brain comorbidities were frequently identified, NPH+ patients representing 40 patients of our sample (76.9%). NPH- patients improved their STV better in the single task (delta of STV = -58.6% ± 54.3% vs. -14.1% ± 62.0%; P = 0.031) and in the dual task (delta of STV =-32.2% ± 33.7% vs. 6.3% ± 58.4%; P = 0.028) after the CSF tap test than NPH+ patients. Amongst NPH+ individuals, only comorbid Alzheimer's disease was associated with STV increase (i.e. deterioration of gait) in the dual task [β 38.4; 95% confidence interval (5.64; 71.24); P = 0.023] after the CSF tap test, whilst it was borderline in the single task [β 35.0; 95% confidence interval (-1.97; 71.90); P = 0.063].Conclusions:Brain comorbidities affect gait improvement after the CSF tap test in NPH patients; this influence is driven by Alzheimer's disease-related pathology.",29222955,PMC5947755,10.1111/ene.13543,10
The Exceptional Vulnerability of Humans to Alzheimer's Disease,"Like many humans, non-human primates deposit copious misfolded Aβ protein in the brain as they age. Nevertheless, the complete behavioral and pathologic phenotype of Alzheimer's disease, including Aβ plaques, neurofibrillary (tau) tangles, and dementia, has not yet been identified in a non-human species. Recent research suggests that the crucial link between Aβ aggregation and tauopathy is somehow disengaged in aged monkeys. Understanding why Alzheimer's disease fails to develop in species that are biologically proximal to humans could disclose new therapeutic targets in the chain of events leading to neurodegeneration and dementia.",28483344,PMC5521004,10.1016/j.molmed.2017.04.001,45
ABI3 Is a Novel Early Biomarker of Alzheimer's Disease,"Background:The Abi3 gene has been suggested to be an important regulator of microglia during Alzheimer's disease (AD), but the diagnostic power of ABI3 in neurodegenerative disease has rarely been reported.Objective:The aim of this study was to evaluate the diagnostic value of ABI3 in AD patients.Methods:ELISAs were used to measure the ABI3 level in the serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of AD patients as well as in the serum of APP/PS1 mice. RT-PCR and western blot were further performed to detect the expression levels of ABI3 in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of AD subjects as well as in the hippocampus and cortical tissue of APP/PS1 mice. The correlation of cognitive ability with ABI3 level was estimated by linear regression analysis. Moreover, the diagnostic value of ABI3 for AD was assessed with ROC analysis.Results:The ABI3 levels all decreased significantly in the serum, CSF, and PBMCs of AD patients and showed a good diagnostic performance. In addition, the ABI3 levels were observed to decrease markedly in the hippocampus from 5-month-old mice, but the dramatic change only appeared in the cortical tissue in the 9-month-old APP/PS1 mice. The ABI3 levels in serum and in the hippocampus of APP/PS1 mice were significantly correlated with cognitive capacity.Conclusion:These results demonstrated that ABI3 in serum, CSF, and PBMCs could be a novel early diagnostic biomarker of AD. Moreover, ABI3 had potential to be a novel tracer marker in hippocampus of early AD.",35275543,,10.3233/JAD-215635,3
The Specific Mechanism of TREM2 Regulation of Synaptic Clearance in Alzheimer's Disease,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease. Synaptic dysfunction is an integral feature of AD pathophysiology and a significant factor in early cognitive impairment in AD. Microglia, which are intrinsic immune cells in the central nervous system, play important regulatory roles in the process of synapse formation. Microglia can refine synaptic connections through synaptic clearance to ensure accurate synaptic transmission. Synaptic clearance is not only existed during central nervous system development but also aberrantly activated during AD pathology. However, the mechanisms of synaptic clearance in AD remain to be investigated. TREM2 is involved in the synaptic clearance of microglia, acting alone or with other molecules, such as apolipoprotein E (APOE). In addition, C1q is essential for microglia-mediated synaptic clearance. In this review, we systematically summarized the potential mechanisms of microglia involved in synaptic clearance, comprehensively reviewed the role of TREM2 in microglia regulating synaptic clearance and proposed our hypothesis that TREM2 interacts with APOE and C1q to promote synaptic clearance. This review provides new insights into the role of TREM2 regulation in microglia synaptic clearance and provides potential prospects for the treatment of AD.",35663962,PMC9160359,10.3389/fimmu.2022.845897,5
Shared and disease-specific glial gene expression changes in neurodegenerative diseases,"We found evolutionarily conserved astrocyte and microglia subpopulations shared across multiple brain regions.

Disruption of Tip60 HAT mediated neural histone acetylation homeostasis is an early common event in neurodegenerative diseases,"Epigenetic dysregulation is a common mechanism shared by molecularly and clinically heterogenous neurodegenerative diseases (NDs). Histone acetylation homeostasis, maintained by the antagonistic activity of histone acetyltransferases (HATs) and histone deacetylases (HDACs), is necessary for appropriate gene expression and neuronal function. Disruption of neural acetylation homeostasis has been implicated in multiple types of NDs including Alzheimer's disease (AD), yet mechanisms underlying alterations remain unclear. We show that like AD, disruption of Tip60 HAT/HDAC2 balance with concomitant epigenetic repression of common Tip60 target neuroplasticity genes occurs early in multiple types of Drosophila ND models such as Parkinson's Disease (PD), Huntington's Disease (HD) and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS). Repressed neuroplasticity genes show reduced enrichment of Tip60 and epigentic acetylation signatures at all gene loci examined with certain genes showing inappropriate HDAC2 repressor enrichment. Functional neuronal consequences for these disease conditions are reminiscent of human pathology and include locomotion, synapse morphology, and short-term memory deficits. Increasing Tip60 HAT levels specifically in the mushroom body learning and memory center in the Drosophila brain protects against locomotion and short-term memory function deficits in multiple NDs. Together, our results support a model by which Tip60 protects against neurological impairments in different NDs via similar modes of action.",33106538,PMC7588445,10.1038/s41598-020-75035-3,12
Proteomics of neurodegenerative diseases: analysis of human post-mortem brain,"Dementias are prevalent brain disorders in the aged population. Dementias pose major socio-medical burden, but currently there is no cure available. Novel proteomics approaches hold promise to identify alterations of the brain proteome that could provide clues on disease etiology, and identify candidate proteins to develop further as a biomarker. In this review, we focus on recent proteomics findings from brains affected with Alzheimer's Disease, Parkinson Disease Dementia, Frontotemporal Dementia, and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis. These studies confirmed known cellular changes, and in addition identified novel proteins that may underlie distinct aspects of the diseases.

Phytochemicals-based Therapeutics against Alzheimer's Disease: An Update,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is one of the main healthcare challenges of the twenty-first century, not only affecting millions of people's quality of life but also increasing the burden on the medical community, families, and society. It is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by learning and cognitive dysfunction, behavioral turbulence, and memory loss and is a major cause of dementia, contributing to 50-60 % of dementia cases in patients above the age of 65. The major pathophysiological changes include accumulation of beta-amyloid plaques (Aβ), highly phosphorylated tau protein, neuroinflammation, GABA neurotransmission disruption, mitochondrial dysfunction, neuronal damage due to free radicals, and decreased concentration of acetylcholine (ACh) and butyrylcholine (BCh). The inability of commercial therapeutics, such as donepezil, rivastigmine, galantamine, and tacrine, leads to the attraction toward phytochemical-based therapeutics. Phytochemicals derived from plants exhibit neuroprotection via targeting apoptosis, neurotrophic factor deficit, mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, and abnormal accumulation of proteins. Here, we discussed some of the neuroprotective phytochemicals used for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases like AD and dementia.",36029077,,10.2174/1568026622666220815104305,6
Alternative platelet activation pathways and their role in neurodegenerative diseases,"Purpose of the review:The study of platelets in the context of neurodegenerative diseases is intensifying, and increasing evidence suggests that platelets may play an important role in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders. Therefore, we aim to provide a comprehensive overview of the role of platelets and their diverse activation pathways in the development of these diseases.Recent findings:Platelets participate in synaptic plasticity, learning, memory, and platelets activated by exercise promote neuronal differentiation in several brain regions. Platelets also contribute to the immune response by modulating their surface protein profile and releasing pro- and anti-inflammatory mediators. In Alzheimer's disease, increased levels of platelet amyloid precursor protein raise the production of amyloid-beta peptides promoting platelet activation, triggering at the same time amyloid-beta fibrillation. In Parkinson's disease, increased platelet α-synuclein is associated with elevated ROS production and mitochondrial dysfunction.Summary:In this review, we revise different platelet activation pathways, those classically involved in hemostasis and wound healing, and alternative activation pathways recently described in the context of neurodegenerative diseases, especially in Alzheimer's disease.",34537329,,10.1016/j.nbd.2021.105512,10
The role of the locus coeruleus/norepinephrine system in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders: An update,"Purpose of review:The aim of this review was to provide an update on current and emerging knowledge of the neuropathological processes affecting the locus coeruleus/norepinephrine (LC/NE) system, their effect on Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease symptomatology, including efforts to translate these notions into therapeutic actions targeting the noradrenergic system.Recent findings:Over the past 2 years, work from multiple groups has contributed to support an early role of locus coeruleus degeneration and/or hyperactivation in the neurodegenerative process, including a trigger of neuroinflammation. Imaging advances are allowing the quantification of locus coeruleus structural features in vivo, which is critical in the early stages of disease. Nonmotor and noncognitive symptoms, often secondary to the involvement of the LC/NE system, are becoming more important in the definition of these diseases and their treatment.Summary:The diverse symptomatology of Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease, which is not limited to cardinal motor and cognitive abnormalities, strongly suggests a multisystem neurodegenerative process. In this context, it is increasingly clear how the LC/NE system plays a key role in the initiation and maintenance of the neurodegenerative process.",35175974,,10.1097/WCO.0000000000001042,4
Icariin: A Potential Neuroprotective Agent in Alzheimer's Disease and Parkinson's Disease,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD) are the most common neurodegenerative diseases worldwide. They are characterized by the loss of neurons and synapses in special parts of the central nervous system (CNS). There is no definitive treatment for AD and PD, but extensive studies are underway to identify the effective drugs which can slow the progression of these diseases by affecting the factors involved in their pathophysiology (i.e., aggregated proteins, neuroinflammation, and oxidative stress). Icariin, a natural compound isolated from Epimedii herba, is known because of its anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant properties. In this regard, there are numerous studies indicating its potential as a natural compound against the progression of CNS disorders, such as neurodegenerative diseases. Therefore, this review aims to re-examine findings on the pharmacologic effects of icariin on factors involved in the pathophysiology of AD and PD.",35802286,,10.1007/s11064-022-03667-0,8
"Alzheimer's disease, aging, and cannabidiol treatment: a promising path to promote brain health and delay aging","Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disease characterized by progressive memory loss, neurodegeneration, and cognitive decline. Aging is one of the risk factors for AD. Although the mechanisms underlying aging and the incidence rate of AD are unclear, aging and AD share some hallmarks, such as oxidative stress and chronic inflammation. Cannabidiol (CBD), the major non-psychoactive phytocannabinoid extracted from Cannabis sativa, has recently emerged as a potential candidate for delaying aging and a valuable therapeutic tool for the treatment of aging-related neurodegenerative diseases due to its antioxidant and anti-inflammation properties. This article reviews the relevant literature on AD, CBD treatment for AD, cellular senescence, aging, and CBD treatment for aging in recent years. By analyzing these published data, we attempt to explore the complex correlation between cellular senescence, aging, and Alzheimer's disease, clarify the positive feedback effect between the senescence of neurocytes and Alzheimer's disease, and summarize the role and possible molecular mechanisms of CBD in preventing aging and treating AD. These data may provide new ideas on how to effectively prevent and delay aging, and develop effective treatment strategies for age-related diseases such as Alzheimer's disease.",38227160,,10.1007/s11033-023-09162-1,0
[Research progress on biomarkers and detection methods for Alzheimer's disease diagnosisin vitro],"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease with insidious onset, posing a serious threat to human physical and mental health. The cognitive impairments caused by AD are generally diffuse and overlap symptomatically with other neurodegenerative diseases. Moreover, the symptoms of AD are often covert, leading to missed opportunities for optimal treatment after diagnosis. Therefore, early diagnosis of AD is crucial.In vitrodiagnostic biomarkers not only contribute to the early clinical diagnosis of AD but also aid in further understanding the disease's pathogenesis, predicting disease progression, and observing the effects of novel candidate therapeutic drugs in clinical trials. Currently, although there are numerous biomarkers associated with AD diagnosis, the complex nature of AD pathogenesis, limitations of individual biomarkers, and constraints of clinical detection methods have hindered the development of efficient, cost-effective, and convenient diagnostic methods and standards. This article provides an overview of the research progress onin vitrodiagnostic biomarkers and detection methods related to AD in recent years.",38008582,,10.3760/cma.j.cn112150-20230517-00385,0
Effect of Multiple Medicines on Dementia Initial Treatment: Experience and Thinking,"Little is known about multiple medicines and initial therapy among people with dementia. To examine the effect of multiple medicines on the initiation of anti-dementia therapy in patients diagnosed with cognitive impairment (CI), a retrospective study with 2742 CI patients was conducted based on the outpatients' medical records. The dementias receiving 1-2 drugs were more likely to be prescribed with anti-dementia (one drug: OR = 1.877; two drugs: OR = 1.770) and psychotropic (one drug: OR = 1.980) treatment, whereas had lower chances of receiving psychotropic medication with the combinations of more than three drugs (Alzheimer's disease: OR = .365; vascular dementia: OR = .940; frontotemporal lobe degeneration: OR = .957; and dementia with Lewy bodies/Parkinson's disease dementia: OR = .952). Multiple medicines can affect anti-dementia therapy initiation in dementia patients and should be paid extreme caution.",34841902,PMC10581110,10.1177/15333175211053134,0
Olfactory disturbances in ageing with and without dementia: towards new diagnostic tools,"Background:Olfactory disorders increase with age and often affect elderly people who have pre-dementia or dementia. Despite the frequent occurrence of olfactory changes at the early stages of neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease, olfactory disorders are rarely assessed in daily clinical practice, mainly due to a lack of standardised assessment tools. The aims of this review were to (1) summarise the existing literature on olfactory disorders in ageing populations and patients with neurodegenerative disorders; (2) present the strengths and weaknesses of current olfactory disorder assessment tools; and (3) discuss the benefits of developing specific olfactory tests for neurodegenerative diseases.Methods:A systematic review was performed of literature published between 2000 and 2015 addressing olfactory disorders in elderly people with or without Alzheimer's disease or other related disorders to identify the main tools currently used for olfactory disorder assessment.Results:Olfactory disorder assessment is a promising method for improving both the early and differential diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease. However, the current lack of consensus on which tests should be used does not permit the consistent integration of olfactory disorder assessment into clinical settings.Conclusion:Otolaryngologists are encouraged to use olfactory tests in older adults to help predict the development of neurodegenerative diseases. Olfactory tests should be specifically adapted to assess olfactory disorders in Alzheimer's disease patients.",28424103,,10.1017/S0022215117000858,9
The Pivotal Role of NF-kB in the Pathogenesis and Therapeutics of Alzheimer's Disease,"Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disease worldwide, with a high prevalence that is expected to double every 20 years. Besides the formation of Aβ plaques and neurofibrillary tangles, neuroinflammation is one the major phenotypes that worsens AD progression. Indeed, the nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) is a well-established inflammatory transcription factor that fuels neurodegeneration. Thus, in this review, we provide an overview of the NF-κB role in the pathogenesis of AD, including its interaction with various molecular factors in AD mice models, neurons, and glial cells. Some of these cell types and molecules include reactive microglia and astrocytes, β-secretase, APOE, glutamate, miRNA, and tau protein, among others. Due to the multifactorial nature of AD development and the failure of many drugs designed to dampen AD progression, the pursuit of novel targets for AD therapeutics, including the NF-κB signaling pathway, is rising. Herein, we provide a synopsis of the drug development landscape for AD treatment, offering the perspective that NF-κB inhibitors may generate widespread interest in AD research in the future. Ultimately, the additional investigation of compounds and small molecules that target NF-κB signaling and the complete understanding of NF-κB mechanistic activation in different cell types will broaden and provide more therapeutic options for AD patients.",36012242,PMC9408758,10.3390/ijms23168972,41
PGC-1α sparks the fire of neuroprotection against neurodegenerative disorders,"Recently, growing evidence has demonstrated that peroxisome proliferator activated receptor γ (PPARγ) coactivator-1α (PGC-1α) is a superior transcriptional regulator that acts via controlling the expression of anti-oxidant enzymes and uncoupling proteins and inducing mitochondrial biogenesis, which plays a beneficial part in the central nervous system (CNS). Given the significance of PGC-1α, we summarize the current literature on the molecular mechanisms and roles of PGC-1α in the CNS. Thus, in this review, we first briefly introduce the basic characteristics regarding PGC-1α. We then depict some of its important cerebral functions and discuss upstream modulators, partners, and downstream effectors of the PGC-1α signaling pathway. Finally, we highlight recent progress in research on the involvement of PGC-1α in certain major neurodegenerative disorders (NDDs), including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Collectively, the data presented here may be useful for supporting the future potential of PGC-1α as a therapeutic target.",29580918,,10.1016/j.arr.2018.03.004,34
Extracellular Vesicles of Mesenchymal Stromal Cells Can be Taken Up by Microglial Cells and Partially Prevent the Stimulation Induced by β-amyloid,"Mesenchymal stromal/stem cells (MSCs) have great capacity for immune regulation. MSCs provide protective paracrine effects, which are partially exerted by extracellular vesicles (EVs). It has been reported that MSCs-derived EVs (MSC-EVs) contain soluble factors, such as cytokines, chemokines, growth factors and even microRNAs, which confer them similar anti-inflammatory and regenerative effects to MSCs. Moreover, MSCs modulate microglia activation through a dual mechanism of action that relies both on cell contact and secreted factors. Microglia cells are the central nervous system immune cells and the main mediators of the inflammation leading to neurodegenerative disorders. Here, we investigated whether MSC-EVs affect the activation of microglia cells by β-amyloid aggregates. We show that the presence of MSC-EVs can prevent the upregulation of pro-inflammatory mediators such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α and nitric oxide (NO). Both are up-regulated in neurodegenerative diseases representing chronic inflammation, as in Alzheimer's disease. We demonstrate that MSC-EVs are internalized by the microglia cells. Further, our study supports the use of MSC-EVs as a promising therapeutic tool to treat neuroinflammatory diseases.Significance StatementIt has been reported that mesenchymal stromal/stem cells and MSC-derived small extracellular vesicles have therapeutic effects in the treatment of various degenerative and inflammatory diseases. Extracellular vesicles are loaded with proteins, lipids and RNA and act as intercellular communication mediators. Here we show that extracellular vesicles can be taken up by murine microglial cells. In addition, they partially reduce the activation of microglial cells against β-amyloid aggregates. This inhibition of microglia activation may present an effective strategy for the control/therapy of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease.",35080744,PMC8942956,10.1007/s12015-021-10261-4,11
Role of Autophagy and Mitophagy in Neurodegenerative Disorders,"Autophagy is a self-destructive cellular process that removes essential metabolites and waste from inside the cell to maintain cellular health. Mitophagy is the process by which autophagy causes disruption inside mitochondria and the total removal of damaged or stressed mitochondria, hence enhancing cellular health. The mitochondria are the powerhouses of the cell, performing essential functions such as ATP (adenosine triphosphate) generation, metabolism, Ca2+buffering, and signal transduction. Many different mechanisms, including endosomal and autophagosomal transport, bring these substrates to lysosomes for processing. Autophagy and endocytic processes each have distinct compartments, and they interact dynamically with one another to complete digestion. Since mitophagy is essential for maintaining cellular health and using genetics, cell biology, and proteomics techniques, it is necessary to understand its beginning, particularly in ubiquitin and receptor-dependent signalling in injured mitochondria. Despite their similar symptoms and emerging genetic foundations, Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), Huntington's disease (HD), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) have all been linked to abnormalities in autophagy and endolysosomal pathways associated with neuronal dysfunction. Mitophagy is responsible for normal mitochondrial turnover and, under certain physiological or pathological situations, may drive the elimination of faulty mitochondria. Due to their high energy requirements and post-mitotic origin, neurons are especially susceptible to autophagic and mitochondrial malfunction. This article focused on the importance of autophagy and mitophagy in neurodegenerative illnesses and how they might be used to create novel therapeutic approaches for treating a wide range of neurological disorders.",36974405,,10.2174/1871527322666230327092855,1
Circadian regulation of astrocyte function: implications for Alzheimer's disease,"The circadian clock regulates rhythms in gene transcription that have a profound impact on cellular function, behavior, and disease. Circadian dysfunction is a symptom of aging and neurodegenerative diseases, and recent studies suggest a bidirectional relationship between impaired clock function and neurodegeneration. Glial cells possess functional circadian clocks which may serve to control glial responses to daily oscillations in brain activity, cellular stress, and metabolism. Astrocytes directly support brain function through synaptic interactions, neuronal metabolic support, neuroinflammatory regulation, and control of neurovascular coupling at blood and CSF barriers. Emerging evidence suggests that the astrocyte circadian clock may be involved in many of these processes, and that clock disruption could influence neurodegeneration by disrupting several aspects of astrocyte function. Here we review the literature surrounding circadian control of astrocyte function in health and disease, and discuss the potential implications of astrocyte clocks for neurodegeneration.",31578625,PMC7098845,10.1007/s00018-019-03314-y,17
Using the synthesized peptide HAYED (5) to protect the brain against iron catalyzed radical attack in a naturally senescence Kunming mouse model,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease of the brain. It cannot be cured currently, and those suffering from AD place a great burden on their caregivers and society. AD is characterized by high levels of iron ions in the brain, which catalyze radicals that damage the neurons. Knowing that the Aβ42 peptide precipitates iron by binding iron ions at amino acid residues D1, E3, H11, H13, and H14, we synthesized a 5-repeat (HAYED) sequence peptide. By treating iron-stressed SH-SY5Y cells with it and injecting it into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of naturally senescence Kunming mouse, which displaying AD-similar symptoms such as learning and memory dysfunction, neuron degeneration and high level of iron in brain, we found that HAYED (5) decreased the iron and radical levels in the cell culture medium and in the CSF. Specially, the synthesized peptide prevented cell and brain damage. Furthermore, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), Morris water maze and passive avoidance tests demonstrated that the peptide ameliorated brain blood-oxygen metabolism and slowed cognitive loss in the experimental senescence mice, and clinical and blood tests showed that HAYED (5) was innoxious to the kidney, the liver and blood and offset the AD-associated inflammation and anemia.",30448512,,10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2018.11.014,4
Learning pyramidal multi-scale harmonic wavelets for identifying the neuropathology propagation patterns of Alzheimer's disease,"Previous studies have established that neurodegenerative disease such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a disconnection syndrome, where the neuropathological burdens often propagate across the brain network to interfere with the structural and functional connections. In this context, identifying the propagation patterns of neuropathological burdens sheds new light on understanding the pathophysiological mechanism of AD progression. However, little attention has been paid to propagation pattern identification by fully considering the intrinsic properties of brain-network organization, which plays an important role in improving the interpretability of the identified propagation pathways. To this end, we propose a novel harmonic wavelet analysis approach to construct a set of region-specific pyramidal multi-scale harmonic wavelets, it allows us to characterize the propagation patterns of neuropathological burdens from multiple hierarchical modules across the brain network. Specifically, we first extract underlying hub nodes through a series of network centrality measurements on the common brain network reference generated from a population of minimum spanning tree (MST) brain networks. Then, we propose a manifold learning method to identify the region-specific pyramidal multi-scale harmonic wavelets corresponding to hub nodes by seamlessly integrating the hierarchically modular property of the brain network. We estimate the statistical power of our proposed harmonic wavelet analysis approach on synthetic data and large-scale neuroimaging data from ADNI. Compared with the other harmonic analysis techniques, our proposed method not only effectively predicts the early stage of AD but also provides a new window to capture the underlying hub nodes and the propagation pathways of neuropathological burdens in AD.",37196535,PMC10503391,10.1016/j.media.2023.102812,0
Iron Oxide Nanoparticle-Incorporated Mesenchymal Stem Cells for Alzheimer's Disease Treatment,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease with multifactorial pathogenesis. However, most current therapeutic approaches for AD target a single pathophysiological mechanism, generally resulting in unsatisfactory therapeutic outcomes. Recently, mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) therapy, which targets multiple pathological mechanisms of AD, has been explored as a novel treatment. However, the low brain retention efficiency of administered MSCs limits their therapeutic efficacy. In addition, autologous MSCs from AD patients may have poor therapeutic abilities. Here, we overcome these limitations by developing iron oxide nanoparticle (IONP)-incorporated human Wharton's jelly-derived MSCs (MSC-IONPs). IONPs promote therapeutic molecule expression in MSCs. Following intracerebroventricular injection, MSC-IONPs showed a higher brain retention efficiency under magnetic guidance. This potentiates the therapeutic efficacy of MSCs in murine models of AD. Furthermore, human Wharton's jelly-derived allogeneic MSCs may exhibit higher therapeutic abilities than those of autologous MSCs in aged AD patients. This strategy may pave the way for developing MSC therapies for AD.",36638236,,10.1021/acs.nanolett.2c03682,4
Structural basis of bioenergetic protein complexes in Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease with no cure where the underlying causes remain elusive. Mitochondrial dysfunction has become a prime suspect in AD pathogenesis since bioenergetic deficits precede the pathology. With advancing structural biology techniques at synchrotrons and cryo-electron microscopes, it is becoming possible to determine the structures of key proteins suspected to contribute to the initiation and propagation of AD, and investigate their interactions. In this review, we provide an overview of the recent developments concerning the structural aspects of mitochondrial protein complexes and their assembly factors involved the production of energy, in pursuit of therapies to halt or even reverse this disease in the early stages when mitochondria are most sensitive to amyloid toxicity.",36966690,,10.1016/j.sbi.2023.102573,2
A review on the new age methodologies for early detection of Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease,"Backgrounds:Neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs) such as Alzheimer's (AD) and Parkinson's (PD) are often diagnosed late, impeding effective treatment; therefore, early detection is imperative. Modern methodologies can serve a pivotal role in fulfilling the crucial need for timely detection and intervention in this context.Objectives:Evaluate early detection's significance and summarize key technologies (biomarkers, neuroimaging, AI/ML, genetics, digital health) for enhanced diagnostic strategies in AD and PD.Methods:This study employs a focused descriptive review approach, encompassing analysis of peer-reviewed articles and clinical trials from existing literature, to provide a nuanced exploration of the subject matter.Findings:This review underscores the efficacy of non-invasive biomarkers, biosensors and emerging promising technologies for advancing early diagnosis of AD and PD.Conclusion:The landscape of early NDD detection has been reshaped by technology, yet challenges persist, encompassing the domains of validation and ethics. A collaborative effort between medical professionals, researchers and technologists is imperative to effectively address and combat NDDs.",38482977,,10.1111/bcpt.14003,0
Multiregional analysis of global 5-methylcytosine and 5-hydroxymethylcytosine throughout the progression of Alzheimer's disease,"Epigenetic modifications to cytosine are known to alter transcriptional states and deregulate gene expression in cancer, embryonic development, and most recently in neurodegeneration. To test the hypothesis that global levels of cytosine modification are altered throughout the progression of Alzheimer's disease, 5-methylcytosine (5-mC) and 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5-hmC) were quantified using gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) and stable labeled internal standards of cytosine, 5-mC, and 5-hmC. Cytosine modifications were quantified in DNA extracted from tissue specimens of four brain regions (cerebellum, inferior parietal lobe, superior and middle temporal gyrus, and hippocampus/parahippocampal gyrus) of cognitively normal control (NC) subjects and subjects with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), preclinical Alzheimer's disease (PCAD), late onset Alzheimer's disease, frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). Repeated measures analyses of the data show significant alterations in 5-mC and 5-hmC in early stages of Alzheimer's disease (PCAD and MCI), as well as FTLD and DLB subjects, across multiple regions of the brain. These data suggest alterations in epigenetic regulation of genes may play an early role in the progression of AD as well as other types of neurodegeneration.",27889911,PMC5250541,10.1111/jnc.13912,21
Nanotechnology in the diagnostic and therapy for Alzheimer's disease,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder primarily characterized by β-amyloid plaque, intraneuronal tangles, significant neuronal loss and cognitive deficit. Treatment in the early stages of the disease is crucial for preventing or perhaps reversing the neurodegeneration in the AD cases. However, none of the current diagnostic procedures are capable of early diagnosis of AD. Further, the available treatments merely provide symptomatic alleviation in AD and do not address the underlying illness. Therefore, there is no permanent cure for AD currently. Better therapeutic outcomes need the optimum drug concentration in the central nervous system (CNS) by traversing blood-brain-barrier (BBB). Nanotechnology offers enormous promise to transform the treatment and diagnostics of neurodegenerative diseases. Nanotechnology based diagnostic tools, drug delivery systems and theragnostic are capable of highly sensitive molecular detection, effective drug targeting and their combination. Significant work has been done in this area over the last decade and prospective results have been obtained in AD therapy. This review explores the various applications of nanotechnology in addressing the varied facets of AD, ranging from early detection to therapeutic interventions. This review also looks at how nanotechnology can help with the development of disease-modifying medicines, such as the delivery of anti-amyloid, anti-tau, cholinesterase inhibitors, antioxidants and hormonal drugs. In conclusion, this paper discusses the role of nanotechnology in the early detection of AD, effective drug targeting to the CNS and theragnostic applications in the management of AD.",38191034,,10.1016/j.bbagen.2024.130559,1
Applying fluid biomarkers to Alzheimer's disease,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a common neurodegenerative disease that starts with a clinically silent phase of a decade or more during which brain pathologies accumulate predominantly in the medial temporal lobe but also elsewhere in the brain. Network dysfunction and clinical symptoms typically appear when senile plaque (amyloid-β) and neurofibrillary tangle (tau) pathologies meet in the brain parenchyma, producing synapse and neuronal loss. For plaque and tangle pathologies, reliable fluid biomarkers have been developed. These require sampling of cerebrospinal fluid. Reliable blood tests for plaque and tangle pathologies are currently lacking, but blood tests for general neurodegeneration have recently been developed. In AD, plaques and tangles often coexist with other pathologies, including Lewy bodies, and to what extent these contribute to symptoms is currently unknown. There are also important differential diagnoses that may be possible to distinguish from AD with the aid of biomarkers. The scope of this review is fluid biomarkers for AD and related pathologies. The purpose is to provide the reader with an updated account of currently available fluid biomarkers for AD and clinically relevant differential diagnoses.",28424166,PMC5538797,10.1152/ajpcell.00007.2017,24
A Promising Strategy to Treat Neurodegenerative Diseases by SIRT3 Activation,"SIRT3, the primary mitochondrial deacetylase, regulates the functions of mitochondrial proteins including metabolic enzymes and respiratory chain components. Although SIRT3's functions in peripheral tissues are well established, the significance of its downregulation in neurodegenerative diseases is beginning to emerge. SIRT3 plays a key role in brain energy metabolism and provides substrate flexibility to neurons. It also facilitates metabolic coupling between fuel substrate-producing tissues and fuel-consuming tissues. SIRT3 mediates the health benefits of lifestyle-based modifications such as calorie restriction and exercise. SIRT3 deficiency is associated with metabolic syndrome (MetS), a precondition for diseases including obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. The pure form of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is rare, and it has been reported to coexist with these diseases in aging populations. SIRT3 downregulation leads to mitochondrial dysfunction, neuroinflammation, and inflammation, potentially triggering factors of AD pathogenesis. Recent studies have also suggested that SIRT3 may act through multiple pathways to reduce plaque formation in the AD brain. In this review, we give an overview of SIRT3's roles in brain physiology and pathology and discuss several activators of SIRT3 that can be considered potential therapeutic agents for the treatment of dementia.",36675125,PMC9866791,10.3390/ijms24021615,1
Neuronal Transplantation for Alzheimer's Disease and Prospects for Generating Exogenic Neurons as a Source of Cells for Implantation,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a devastating neurodegenerative disease with limited therapeutic options. Cellular transplantation of healthy exogenic neurons to replace and restore neuronal cell function has previously been explored in AD animal models, yet most of these transplantation methods have utilized primary cell cultures or donor grafts. Blastocyst complementation offers a novel approach to generate a renewable exogenic source of neurons. These exogenic neurons derived from stem cells would develop with thein vivocontext of the inductive cues within a host, thus recapitulating the neuron-specific characteristics and physiology. AD affects many different cell types including hippocampal neurons and limbic projection neurons, cholinergic nucleus basis and medial septal neurons, noradrenergic locus coeruleus neurons, serotonergic raphe neurons, and limbic and cortical interneurons. Blastocyst complementation can be adapted to generate these specific neuronal cells afflicted by AD pathology, by ablating important cell type and brain region-specific developmental genes. This review discusses the current state of neuronal transplantation to replace specific neural cell types affected by AD, and the developmental biology to identify candidate genes for knockout in embryos for creating niches to generate exogenic neuronsviablastocyst complementation.",37219048,PMC10214098,10.1177/09636897231164712,1
"The role of Th17 cells/IL-17A in AD, PD, ALS and the strategic therapy targeting on IL-17A","Neurodegenerative diseases are a group of disorders characterized by progressive loss of certain populations of neurons, which eventually lead to dysfunction. These diseases include Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Immune pathway dysregulation is one of the common features of neurodegeneration. Recently, there is growing interest in the specific role of T helper Th 17 cells and Interleukin-17A (IL-17A), the most important cytokine of Th 17 cells, in the pathogenesis of the central nervous system (CNS) of neurodegenerative diseases. In the present study, we summarized current knowledge about the function of Th17/IL-17A, the physiology of Th17/IL-17A in diseases, and the contribution of Th17/IL-17A in AD, PD, and ALS. We also update the findings on IL-17A-targeting drugs as potentially immunomodulatory therapeutic agents for neurodegenerative diseases. Although the specific mechanism of Th17/IL-17A in this group of diseases is still controversial, uncovering the molecular pathways of Th17/IL-17A in neurodegeneration allows the identification of suitable targets to modulate these cellular processes. Therapeutics targeting IL-17A might represent potentially novel anti-neurodegeneration drugs.",35459141,PMC9034482,10.1186/s12974-022-02446-6,16
Neurofilament-labeled pyramidal neurons and astrocytes are deficient in DNA methylation marks in Alzheimer's disease,"There is increasing evidence that epigenetic alterations may play a role in Alzheimer's disease (AD); yet, there is little information regarding epigenetic modifications in specific cell types. We assessed DNA methylation (5-methylcytosine [5mC]) and hydroxymethylation (5-hydroxymethylcytosine [5hmC]) marks specifically in neuronal and glial cell types in the inferior temporal gyrus of human AD cases and age-matched controls. Interestingly, neurofilament (NF)-labeled pyramidal neurons that are vulnerable to AD pathology are deficient in extranuclear 5mC in AD cases compared with controls. We also found that fewer astrocytes exhibited nuclear 5mC and 5hmC marks in AD cases compared with controls. However, there were no alterations in 5mC and 5hmC in disease-resistant calretinin interneurons or microglia in AD, and there was no alteration in the density of 5mC- or 5hmC-labeled nuclei in near-plaque versus plaque-free regions in late-AD cases. 5mC and 5hmC were present in a high proportion of neurofibrillary tangles, suggesting no loss of DNA methylation marks in tangle bearing neurons. We provide evidence that epigenetic dysregulation may be occurring in astrocytes and NF-positive pyramidal neurons in AD.",27459923,,10.1016/j.neurobiolaging.2016.05.003,18
Derivation of induced pluripotent stem cell SJTUi003-A from a 69-year-old Chinese Han Sporadic Alzheimer's disease patient with APOEε3/ε4 genetic background,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an age-related and progressive neurodegenerative disease. In this study, we generated an induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) line from the dermal fibroblasts of a 69-year-old female patient carrying APOEε3/ε4 allele and diagnosed with sporadic AD. The iPSC line will be a useful tool for investigating the pathogenesis mechanisms and for drug tests in AD.",37343430,,10.1016/j.scr.2023.103142,0
[Causes and Consequences of Genome Instability in Psychiatric and Neurodegenerative Diseases],"Each neuron has 100-10000 connections (synapses) with other neural cells, therefore genome pathologies affecting a small proportion of brain cells are capable of causing dysfunction of the entire central nervous system (CNS). Recently, genome and chromosome instability has been uncovered in neurodegeneration (Alzheimer's disease, ataxia telangiectasia). Somatic tissue-specific mosaicism was observed in the brain of individuals with neuropsychiatric diseases including schizophrenia, autism, intellectual disability, and epilepsy. The study of genetic processes in neurons allows determination of a certain number of genetic pathways and candidate processes, modifications of which can cause impaired genome stability. Brain-specific somatic mutations generally occur at the earliest stages of development. Accordingly, genome variability and somatic mosaicism are expected to be mediated by cell cycle regulation, DNA repair, DNA replication, and programmed cell death in the brain. Endomitosis, endoreduplication, and abortive entrance to the cell cycle are also commonly observed in neurodegeneration. Brain-specific genome instability maybe a key element in the pathogenic cascade of neurodegeneration. Here we review the current state of knowledge concerning somatic genome variations in neurodegenerative and psychiatric diseases and analyze the causes and consequences of genomic instability in the CNS.",33566024,,10.31857/S0026898421010158,8
Don't forget astrocytes when targeting Alzheimer's disease,"Astrocytes are essential for CNS health, regulating homeostasis, metabolism, and synaptic transmission. In addition to these and many other physiological roles, the pathological impact of astrocytes (""reactive astrocytes"") in acute trauma and chronic disease like Alzheimer's disease (AD) is well established. Growing evidence supports a fundamental and active role of astrocytes in multiple neurodegenerative diseases. With a growing interest in normal astrocyte biology, and countless studies on changes in astrocyte function in the context of disease, it may be a surprise that no therapies exist incorporating astrocytes as key targets. Here, we examine unintentional effects of current AD therapies on astrocyte function and theorize how astrocytes may be intentionally targeted for more efficacious therapeutic outcomes. Given their integral role in normal neuronal functioning, incorporating astrocytes as key criteria for AD drug development can only lead to more effective therapies for the millions of AD sufferers worldwide.

Synapses in neurodegenerative diseases,"Synapse is the basic structural and functional component for neural communication in the brain. The presynaptic terminal is the structural and functionally essential area that initiates communication and maintains the continuous functional neural information flow. It contains synaptic vesicles (SV) filled with neurotransmitters, an active zone for release, and numerous proteins for SV fusion and retrieval. The structural and functional synaptic plasticity is a representative characteristic; however, it is highly vulnerable to various pathological conditions. In fact, synaptic alteration is thought to be central to neural disease processes. In particular, the alteration of the structural and functional phenotype of the presynaptic terminal is a highly significant evidence for neural diseases. In this review, we specifically describe structural and functional alteration of nerve terminals in several neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and Huntington's disease (HD).

A conformationally-locked p-hydroxybenzylidene imidazolinone derivative for detecting Aβ42aggregation,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a common type of neurodegenerative disease, which can only be symptomatically relieved but does not yet have a cure. Among the different Aβ species, amyloid-β42(Aβ42) aggregates are proposed to be more neurotoxic than that of Aβ40, and oligomeric Aβ42is thought to play a harmful role in the pathophysiology of AD. Therefore, the detection of Aβ42aggregation is very meaningful in the AD field. We herein report a conformationally-locked p- hydroxybenzylidene imidazolinone derivative, BDI, which exhibits selectivity and specificity towards Aβ42aggregation and remarkable fluorescent enhancement with a large Stokes shift (more than 100 nm). In the fluorescent co-localization study, BDI can sensitively detect a large population of Aβ42aggregation over that of Aβ40in the brain tissues of AD transgenic mouse models. Therefore, this new probe could provide a useful tool for the rapid detection of important Aβ species in AD.",38061401,,10.1016/j.bmcl.2023.129576,0
The Role of the Gut Microbiota and Microbial Metabolites in the Pathogenesis of Alzheimer's Disease,"Alzheimer's disease is a neurodegenerative disease that causes memory loss, cognitive dysfunction and dementia. It is a multifactorial disease involving a wide range of pathological factors that have yet to be fully understood. As proposed by scientists and supported by a growing amount of evidence in recent years, the gut microbiota plays an important role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease via a constant bidirectional communication through the brain-gut-microbiota axis, which is a multifunctional network involving the nervous system and the peripheral circulatory system. This communication pathway facilitates the exchange of information and signals between the brain and the gut, such as microbe-derived metabolites and neurotransmitters, which allows gut microbes to influence the central nervous system. This review summarizes recent research findings on the pathological risk factors of Alzheimer's disease, the brain-gut-microbiota axis, the role of gut microbe-derived products in neurological disorders, and clinical/preclinical studies investigating the role of the gut microbiota in Alzheimer's disease. In addition, some suggestions for future research are proposed.",35440320,,10.2174/1871527321666220417005115,3
[Alzheimer’s disease – diagnosis and treatment],"Alzheimer's disease is the most common cause of dementia globally.

Sex Differences in Neurodegeneration: The Role of the Immune System in Humans,"Growing evidence supports significant involvement of immune dysfunction in the etiology of neurodegenerative diseases, several of which also display prominent sex differences across prevalence, pathology, and symptomology. In this review, we summarize evidence from human studies of established and recent findings of sex differences in multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and discuss how sex-specific central nervous system innate immune activity could contribute to downstream sex differences in these diseases. We examine human genomic and transcriptomics studies in each neurodegenerative disease through the lens of sex differences in the neuroimmune system and highlight the importance of stratifying sex in clinical and translational research studies. Finally, we discuss the limitations of the existing studies and outline recommendations for further advancing sex-based analyses to uncover novel disease mechanisms that could ultimately help treat both sexes.",33715827,PMC8263798,10.1016/j.biopsych.2021.01.002,27
Early-Stage Identification and Pathological Development of Alzheimer's Disease Using Multimodal MRI,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is one of the most common progressive and irreversible neurodegenerative diseases. The study of the pathological mechanism of AD and early-stage diagnosis is essential and important. Subjective cognitive decline (SCD), the first at-risk stage of AD occurring prior to amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI), is of great research value and has gained our interest. To investigate the entire pathological development of AD pathology efficiently, we proposed a machine learning classification method based on a multimodal support vector machine (SVM) to investigate the structural and functional connectivity patterns of the three stages of AD (SCD, aMCI, and AD). Our experiments achieved an accuracy of 98.58% in the AD group, 97.76% in the aMCI group, and 80.24% in the SCD group. Moreover, in our experiments, we identified the most discriminating brain regions, which were mainly located in the default mode network and subcortical structures (SCS). Notably, with the development of AD pathology, SCS regions have become increasingly important, and structural connectivity has shown more discriminative power than functional connectivity. The current study may shed new light on the pathological mechanism of AD and suggests that whole-brain connectivity may provide potential effective biomarkers for the early-stage diagnosis of AD.",30958352,,10.3233/JAD-181049,22
Modifying the diet and gut microbiota to prevent and manage neurodegenerative diseases,"The global prevalence of Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease is steadily increasing due to the aging population. The lack of effective drugs against these neurodegenerative disorders makes it imperative to identify new strategies for their prevention and treatment. Recent studies have revealed that harnessing the power of the gut microbiota through modification of diet may be a valuable approach for reducing the risk, modulating the symptoms, and ameliorating the pathophysiological aspects of neurodegenerative diseases. Consuming specific dietary components can alter the prevalence of bacterial communities within the gut to a healthy enterotype, which can influence the production of beneficial metabolites by microbiota. This article focuses on several dietary components, which have been demonstrated to affect the gut microbiota-brain axis and therefore could lead to attenuation of specific pathological processes in neurodegenerative diseases. Published evidence indicates that fermented foods, including kefir, and foods that are high in bioactive polyphenols and complex carbohydrates, such as grapes, pomegranates, and seaweed, may be effective at reducing neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, neurotransmitter dysfunction, and neuronal death associated with Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. Even though experimental evidence supporting the protective properties of the above dietary components in these diseases is emerging, it is evident that further human clinical studies are required to conclusively establish the benefits of any suggested dietary interventions. The translational potential of such research is illustrated by the clinical success of the recently developed Alzheimer's drug, GV-971, which is a seaweed derivative that works by modulating the gut microbiota-brain axis.",35304983,PMC9514114,10.1515/revneuro-2021-0146,7
Alzheimer's disease: From immunotherapy to immunoprevention,"Recent Aβ-immunotherapy trials have yielded the first clear evidence that removing aggregated Aβ from the brains of symptomatic patients can slow the progression of Alzheimer's disease. The clinical benefit achieved in these trials has been modest, however, highlighting the need for both a deeper understanding of disease mechanisms and the importance of intervening early in the pathogenic cascade. An immunoprevention strategy for Alzheimer's disease is required that will integrate the findings from clinical trials with mechanistic insights from preclinical disease models to select promising antibodies, optimize the timing of intervention, identify early biomarkers, and mitigate potential side effects.",37729908,,10.1016/j.cell.2023.08.021,16
Redox-sensitive GFP to monitor oxidative stress in neurodegenerative diseases,"Redox processes are key events in the degenerative cascade of many adult-onset neurodegenerative diseases (NDs), but the biological relevance of a single redox change is often dependent on the redox couple involved and on its subcellular origin. The biosensors based on engineered fluorescent proteins (redox-sensitive GFP [roGFP]) offer a unique opportunity to monitor redox changes in both physiological and pathological contexts in living animals and plants. Here, we review the use of roGFPs to monitor oxidative stress in different three adult-onset NDs: Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Despite the many differences spanning from incidence to onset, the hypotheses on biological processes underlying both sporadic and familiar ND forms in humans outline a model in which noncompeting mechanisms are likely to converge in various unsuccessful patterns to mediate the selective degeneration of a specific neuronal population. roGFPs, targeted to different cell compartments, are successfully used as specific markers of cell toxicity, induced by expression of causative genes linked to a determined ND. We also report the use of roGFP to monitor oxidative stress induced by the expression of the ALS-causative gene SOD1.",28030361,,10.1515/revneuro-2016-0041,4
"Cholinergic dysfunction, neurodegeneration, and amyloid-beta pathology in neurodegenerative diseases","Cholinergic dysfunction is central in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). The electroencephalography-based acetylcholine index (EEG-Ach index) has been proposed as a biomarker of cholinergic dysfunction. However, it is unclear how the EEG-Ach index relates to amyloid-beta pathology and neurodegeneration. We investigated the association between the EEG-Ach index and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) amyloid-beta, CSF total tau, cortical thickness, and hippocampal volume from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and cognition. A total of 127 patients with different neurodegenerative diseases were studied. The EEG-Ach index was calculated from quantitative EEG using statistical pattern recognition. The EEG-Ach index was associated with hippocampal volume and cortical thickness in frontal, temporal, and occipital cortices. Cross-sectional sub-analyses based on a small sample suggests that the EEG-Ach index increases the closest to AD dementia, downstream to amyloid-beta pathology, CSF total tau, and hippocampal volume. We conclude that cholinergic dysfunction correlates with atrophy in brain areas important for AD pathogenesis, and this association is more prominent in the dementia stage. These results together with previous studies from this project suggest that the EEG-Ach index may be a useful biomarker for cholinergic dysfunction, with value for differential diagnosis of dementia and monitoring patients at the dementia stage.",32505903,,10.1016/j.pscychresns.2020.111099,7
The discriminative capacity of CSF β-amyloid 42 and Tau in neurodegenerative diseases in the Chinese population,"Introduction:In the past few years, the β-amyloid 42 peptide and tau protein in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) have become primary diagnostic biomarkers in differentiating Alzheimer's disease (AD) and cognitive normal controls. As we know, several neurodegenerative diseases have been reported to overlap with AD in neuropathology and clinical symptoms. To examine the discriminative utility of these biomarkers in AD and other neurodegenerative diseases, we measured them in a cohort of Chinese population.Methods:We measured CSF Aβ42, t-tau and p-tau181by ELISA tests and calculated the ratios of t-tau/Aβ42and p-tau181/Aβ42in 240 Chinese Han patients with AD (n = 82), frontotemporal dementia (FTD, n = 20), Huntington's disease (HD, n = 27), multiple system atrophy (MSA, n = 24), spinocerebellar ataxia type-3 (SCA3, n = 27), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS, n = 36) and controls (n = 24).Results:As expected, all biomarkers showed high discriminative capacity between AD and non-AD groups (p < .05) except for the elevated CSF t-tau in FTD (p > .05). Comparing with the controls, tau related biomarkers significantly elevated in the FTD (p < .001) and MSA (p < .05) groups. Surprisingly, comparing with controls, we found that CSF Aβ42increased remarkably in the SCA3 (p < .05), HD and ALS groups (p < .001), achieving a high specificity, respectively.Conclusion:To our best knowledge, this is the first comprehensive study in the Han Chinese population that confirmed the discriminative utility of CSF Aβ42and tau biomarkers between AD and other neurodegenerative diseases.",32142967,,10.1016/j.jns.2020.116756,7
The role of mind theory in patients affected by neurodegenerative disorders and impact on caregiver burden,"Background:Theory of Mind (ToM) is defined as the ability to understand mental and emotional state. This ability is assessed also in neurodegenerative disease. Few studies have investigated the impact that social cognition of patients could have on caregiver burden. The aim of this study was to investigate a possible correlation in level of social cognition impairment between patients with different neurodegenerative disorders and their caregivers with possible impact on caregivers burden.Methods:we enrolled 48 patients with dementia divided in different groups: Fronto-Temporal Dementia (FTD), Alzheimer Disease (AD), and Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) and also the three groups of their respective caregivers. All subjects were submitted to ToM tests, and the caregiver groups also to Caregiver Burden Inventory (CBI) to evaluate level of burden.Results:Our results showed that ToM was more impaired in FTD patients and in their caregivers In addition, FTD group showed more impaired performances in tasks related to emotional skills.Conclusions:We suggested that ToM impairment of patients are related to ToM impairment of caregivers with differences of scores in caregiver groups. The caregiver difficulties to understand, attribute and describe emotional and mental states of their relatives develop distress and inability in burden management and disorders relative to neurodegenerative disease.",32402618,,10.1016/j.jocn.2020.05.028,4
Abnormal whisker movements in the 3xTg-AD mouse model of Alzheimer's disease,"Alzheimer's disease is the most frequent form of dementia in elderly people. The triple transgenic (3xTg-AD) mouse model of Alzheimer's Disease is important in biomedical research as these mice develop both neuropathological and behavioural phenotypes. However, their behavioural phenotype is variable, with findings depending on the specific task, as well as the age and sex of the mice. Whisker movements show motor, sensory and cognitive deficits in mouse models of neurodegenerative disease. Therefore, we examined whisker movements in 3, 12.5 and 17-month-old female 3xTg-AD mice and their B6129S/F2 wildtype controls. Mice were filmed using a high-speed video camera (500 fps) in an open arena during a novel object exploration task. Genotype and age differences were found in mice exploring the arena prior to object contact. Prior to whisker contact, the 3-month-old 3xTg-AD mice had smaller whisker angles compared with the wildtype controls, suggesting an early motor phenotype in these mice. Pre-contact mean angular position at 3 months and whisking amplitude at 17 months of age differed between the 3xTg-AD and wildtype mice. During object contact 3xTg-AD mice did not reduce whisker spread as frequently as the wildtype mice at 12.5 and 17 months, which may suggest sensory or attentional deficits. We show that whisker movements are a powerful behavioural measurement tool for capturing behavioural deficits in mouse models that show complex phenotypes, such as the 3xTg-AD mouse model.",35733405,PMC9744487,10.1111/gbb.12813,0
Friend or enemy? Review of 17β-HSD10 and its role in human health or disease,"17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (17β-HSD10) is a multifunctional human enzyme with important roles both as a structural component and also as a catalyst of many metabolic pathways. This mitochondrial enzyme has important functions in the metabolism, development and aging of the neural system, where it is involved in the homeostasis of neurosteroids, especially in regard to estradiol, changes in which make it an essential part of neurodegenerative pathology. These roles therefore, indicate that 17β-HSD10 may be a possible druggable target for neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's disease (AD), and in hormone-dependent cancer. The objective of this review was to provide a summary about physiological functions and pathological roles of 17β-HSD10 and the modulators of its activity.",32306391,,10.1111/jnc.15027,14
Beneficial Effects of Snail Helix aspersa Extract in an Experimental Model of Alzheimer's Type Dementia,"Background:Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex neurodegenerative disease with multifactorial etiology, unsatisfactory treatment, and a necessity for broad-spectrum active substances for cure. The mucus from Helix aspersa snail is a mixture of bioactive molecules with antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and anti-apoptotic effects. So far there are no data concerning the capacity of snail extract (SE) to affect neurodegenerative disorders.Objective:The effects of SE from Helix aspersa on learning and memory deficits in Alzheimer's type dementia (ATD) induced by scopolamine (Sco) in male Wistar rats were examined and some mechanisms of action underlying these effects were evaluated.Methods:SE (0.5 mL/100 g) was applied orally through a food tube for 16 consecutive days: 5 days before and 11 days simultaneously with Sco (2 mg/kg, intraperitoneally). At the end of Sco treatment, using behavioral methods, we evaluated memory performance. Additionally, in cortex and hippocampus the acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity, acetylcholine and monoamines (dopamine, noradrenaline, and serotonin) content, levels of main oxidative stress markers, and expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) were determined.Results:We demonstrated that, according to all behavioral tests used, SE significantly improved the cognitive deficits induced by Sco. Furthermore, SE possessed AChE inhibitory activity, moderate antioxidant properties and the ability to modulate monoamines content in two brain structures. Moreover, multiple SE applications not only restored the depressed by Sco expression of CREB and BDNF, but significantly upregulated it.Conclusion:Summarizing results, we conclude that complex mechanisms underlie the beneficial effects of SE on impaired memory in Alzheimer's type dementia.",35599481,,10.3233/JAD-215693,4
Potential of Therapeutic Small Molecules in Apoptosis Regulation in the Treatment of Neurodegenerative Diseases: An Updated Review,"Neurodegenerative disorders (NDs) include Parkinson's disease (PD), Alzheimer's disease (AD), Huntington's disease (HD), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and the common feature of NDs is the progressive death of specific neurons in the brain. Apoptosis is very important in developing the nervous system, nonetheless an elevated level of cell death has been observed in the case of NDs. NDs are different in terms of their neuronal vulnerability and clinical manifestations, however they have some overlapping neurodegenerative pathways. It has been demonstrated by several studies with cell lines and animal models that apoptosis has a significant contribution to make in advancing AD, ALS, HD, and PD. Numerous dying neurons were also identified in the brains of individuals with NDs and these conditions were found to be linked with substantial cell loss along with common characteristics of apoptosis including activation of caspases and cysteine-proteases, DNA fragmentation, and chromatin condensation. It has been demonstrated that several therapeutic agents including antioxidants, minocycline, GAPDH ligands, p53 inhibitors, JNK (c-Jun N-Terminal Kinase) inhibitors, glycogen synthase kinase-3 inhibitor, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, D2 dopamine receptor agonists, FK506, cell cycle inhibitors, statins, drugs targeting peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors, and gene therapy have the potential to provide protection to neurons against apoptosis. Therefore, the use of these potential therapeutic agents might be beneficial in the treatment of NDs. In this review, we have summarized the pathways that are linked with apoptotic neuronal death in the case of various NDs. We have particularly focused on the therapeutic agents that have neuroprotective properties and the potential to regulate apoptosis in NDs.",36364033,PMC9654492,10.3390/molecules27217207,7
Influential role of 7-Ketocholesterol in the progression of Alzheimer's disease,"Millions of people are affected by neurodegenerative diseases worldwide. They occur due to the loss of brain functions or peripheral nervous system dysfunction. If untreated, prolonged condition ultimately leads to death. Mostly they are associated with stress, altered cholesterol metabolism, inﬂammation and organelle dysfunction. Endogenous cholesterol and phospholipids in brain undergo auto-oxidation by enzymatic as well as non-enzymatic modes leading to the formation of by-products such as 4-hydroxynonenal and oxysterols. Among various oxysterols, 7-ketocholesterol (7KCh) is one of the major toxic components involved in altering neuronal lipid metabolism, contributing to inﬂammation and nerve cell damage. More evidently 7KCh is proven to induce oxidative stress and affects membrane permeability. Loss in mitochondrial membrane potential affects metabolism of cell organelles such as lysosomes and peroxisomes which are involved in lipid and protein homeostasis. This in turn could affect amyloidogenesis, tau protein phosphorylation and accumulation in pathological conditions of neurodegenerative diseases. Lipid alterations and the consequent pathogenic protein accumulation, results in the damage of cell organelles and microglial cells. This could be a reason behind disease progression and predominantly reported characteristics of neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease. This review focuses on the role of 7KCh mediated neurodegenerative Alzheimer's disease with emphasis on alterations in the lipid raft microdomain. In addition, current trends in the significant therapies related to 7KCh inhibition are highlighted.",34273491,,10.1016/j.prostaglandins.2021.106582,10
Cholinesterase inhibitors and memantine for the treatment of Alzheimer and non-Alzheimer dementias,"In aging societies, the morbidity and mortality of dementia is increasing at a significant rate, thereby imposing burden on healthcare, economy and the society as well. Patients' and caregivers' quality of life and life expectancy are greatly determined by the early diagnosis and the initiation of available symptomatic treatments. Cholinesterase inhibitors and memantine have been the cornerstones of Alzheimer's therapy for approximately two decades and over the years, more and more experience has been gained on their use in non-Alzheimer's dementias too. The aim of our work was to provide a comprehensive summary about the use of cholinesterase inhibitors and memantine for the treatment of Alzheimer's and non-Alzheimers's dementias.",34856086,,10.18071/isz.74.0379,5
"Alzheimer's disease: Insights and new prospects in disease pathophysiology, biomarkers and disease-modifying drugs","Alzheimer's disease (AD) is one of the most prevalent neurodegenerative diseases that affect millions of people worldwide, with both prevalence and incidence increasing with age. It is characterized by cognitive decline associated, specifically, with degeneration of cholinergic neurons. The problem of this disease is even more fundamental as the available therapies remain fairly limited and mainly focused on symptoms' relief. Although the aetiology of the disease remains elusive, two main pathological hallmarks are described: i) presence of neurofibrillary tangles formed by unfolded protein aggregates (hyperphosphorylated Tau protein) and ii) presence of extracellular aggregates of amyloid-beta peptide. Given the complexity surrounding the pathogenesis of the disease, several potential targets have been highlighted and interrelated upon its progression, such as oxidative stress and the accumulation of metal ions. Thus, advances have been made on the development of innovative multitarget therapeutical compounds to delay the disease progression and restore cell function. This review focuses the ongoing research on new insights and emerging disease-modifying drugs for AD treatment. Furthermore, classical and novel potential biomarkers for early diagnosis of the disease, and their role in assisting on the improvement of targeted therapies will also be approached.",36996971,,10.1016/j.bcp.2023.115522,9
Bispectrum-based Cross-frequency Functional Connectivity: Classification of Alzheimer's disease,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease known to affect brain functional connectivity (FC). Linear FC measures have been applied to study the differences in AD by splitting neurophysiological signals such as electroencephalography (EEG) recordings into discrete frequency bands and analysing them in isolation. We address this limitation by quantifying cross-frequency FC in addition to the traditional within-band approach. Cross-bispectrum, a higher-order spectral analysis, is used to measure the nonlinear FC and is compared with the cross-spectrum, which only measures the linear FC within bands. Each frequency coupling is then used to construct an FC network, which is in turn vectorised and used to train a classifier. We show that fusing features from networks improves classification accuracy. Although both within-frequency and cross-frequency networks can be used to predict AD with high accuracy, our results show that bispectrum-based FC outperforms cross-spectrum suggesting an important role of cross-frequency FC. Clinical relevance-This establishes diagnostic relevance of cross-frequency coupling in Alzheimer's disease.",36086488,,10.1109/EMBC48229.2022.9871366,0
Rutin as a Natural Therapy for Alzheimer's Disease: Insights into its Mechanisms of Action,"Rutin (quercetin-3-O-rutinoside) is a multifunctional natural flavonoid glycoside with profound effects on the various cellular functions under pathological conditions. Due to the ability of rutin and/or its metabolites to cross the blood brain barrier, it has also been shown to modify the cognitive and various behavioral symptoms of neurodegenerative diseases. In this review, its therapeutic potential for Alzheimer's disease (AD) is evaluated through appraisal of current literatures relevant to the various cellular and molecular targets of the disease. Among the most relevant mechanisms involved are effect on amyloid beta (Aβ) processing, aggregation and action; alteration of the oxidant-antioxidant balance associated with neuronal cell loss; removing the inflammatory component of neurodegeneration, etc. The effect of rutin resulting from its physicochemical features related to effects like metal chelation and bioavailability are also discussed.",26898570,,10.2174/0929867323666160217124333,42
"Multiproteinopathy, neurodegeneration and old age: a case study",A complex spectrum of mixed brain pathologies is common in older people. This clinical pathologic conference case study illustrates the challenges of formulating clinicopathologic correlations in late-onset neurodegenerative diseases featuring cognitive-behavioral syndromes with underlying multiple proteinopathy. Studies on the co-existence and interactions of Alzheimer's disease (AD) with neurodegenerative non-AD pathologies in the aging brain are needed to understand the pathogenesis of neurodegeneration and to support the development of diagnostic biomarkers and therapies.,29307276,PMC5877460,10.1080/13554794.2017.1420199,0
Comprehensive Analysis of Long Non-Coding RNAs N4-Acetylcytidine in Alzheimer's Disease Mice Model Using High-Throughput Sequencing,"Background:N4-acetylcytidine (ac4C), an important posttranscriptional modification, is involved in various disease processes. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) regulate gene expression mainly through epigenetic modification, transcription, and posttranscriptional modification. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by amyloidosis of the brain. However, the role of lncRNA ac4C modification in AD remains unclear.Objective:In this study, we investigated the association between ac4C modification and AD, and the underlying mechanisms of ac4C modification in AD.Methods:The male 9-month-old APP/PS1 double transgenic mice, age- and sex-matched wild type (WT) mice were used in this study. Then, ac4C-RIP-seq and RNA-seq were used to comprehensively analyze lncRNA ac4C modification in AD mice. The lncRNA-miRNA-mRNA regulatory networks using Gene Ontology (GO), Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analyses showed the regulatory relationships among these three lncRNAs and AD.Results:The results showed that there were 120 significantly different ac4C peaks located on 102 lncRNAs in AD, of which 55 were hyperacetylated and 47 were hypoacetylated. Simultaneously, 231 differentially expressed lncRNAs were identified, including 138 upregulated lncRNAs and 93 downregulated lncRNAs. Moreover, 3 lncRNAs, lncRNA Gm26508, lncRNA A430046D13Rik, and lncRNA 9530059O14Rik, showed significant changes in both the ac4C and RNA levels using conjoint analysis.Conclusion:The abundance of lncRNA ac4C modification is significantly different in AD and indicates that lncRNA ac4C is associated with the occurrence and development of AD, which could provide a basis for further exploration of the related regulatory mechanisms.",36314201,,10.3233/JAD-220564,2
A Scoping Review of Dietary Factors Conferring Risk or Protection for Cognitive Decline in APOE ε4 Carriers,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive and fatal neurodegenerative disease. The strongest genetic risk factor for sporadic AD is carriage of the ε4 allele of the Apolipoprotein E (APOE) gene. Strategies to slow the progression of AD, including dietary interventions, may be modified by the pathogenic effect of this polymorphism. Our objective in this review was to determine the extent and quality of the literature investigating how dietary factors and interventions interact with the APOE ε4 genotype to impact cognitive decline in AD. To that end, we performed a systematic scoping review of published English-language articles involving human subjects. We found evidence suggesting that adherence to a Mediterranean diet may reduce cognitive decline among APOE ε4 carriers, whereas ketogenic agents appear to be ineffective. Diets high in saturated fats may be particularly harmful for APOE ε4 carriers. We identified several topics, including the use of ω-3 fatty acid and antioxidant supplements, for which additional high level evidence is needed.",34866144,PMC8890439,10.1007/s12603-021-1705-4,1
Broader Insights into Understanding Tumor Necrosis Factor and Neurodegenerative Disease Pathogenesis Infer New Therapeutic Approaches,"Proinflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF), with its now appreciated key roles in neurophysiology as well as neuropathophysiology, are sufficiently well-documented to be useful tools for enquiry into the natural history of neurodegenerative diseases. We review the broader literature on TNF to rationalize why abruptly-acquired neurodegenerative states do not exhibit the remorseless clinical progression seen in those states with gradual onsets. We propose that the three typically non-worsening neurodegenerative syndromes, post-stroke, post-traumatic brain injury (TBI), and post cardiac arrest, usually become and remain static because of excess cerebral TNF induced by the initial dramatic peak keeping microglia chronically activated through an autocrine loop of microglial activation through excess cerebral TNF. The existence of this autocrine loop rationalizes post-damage repair with perispinal etanercept and proposes a treatment for cerebral aspects of COVID-19 chronicity. Another insufficiently considered aspect of cerebral proinflammatory cytokines is the fitness of the endogenous cerebral anti-TNF system provided by norepinephrine (NE), generated and distributed throughout the brain from the locus coeruleus (LC). We propose that an intact LC, and therefore an intact NE-mediated endogenous anti-cerebral TNF system, plus the DAMP (damage or danger-associated molecular pattern) input having diminished, is what allows post-stroke, post-TBI, and post cardiac arrest patients a strong long-term survival advantage over Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease sufferers. In contrast, Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease patients remorselessly worsen, being handicapped by sustained, accumulating, DAMP and PAMP (pathogen-associated molecular patterns) input, as well as loss of the LC-origin, NE-mediated, endogenous anti-cerebral TNF system. Adrenergic receptor agonists may counter this.",33459706,PMC7990436,10.3233/JAD-201186,11
Characterizing the Effect of Multivalent Conjugates Composed of Aβ-Specific Ligands and Metal Nanoparticles on Neurotoxic Fibrillar Aggregation,"Therapeutically active small molecules represent promising nonimmunogenic alternatives to antibodies for specifically targeting disease-relevant receptors. However, a potential drawback compared to antibody-antigen interactions may be the lower affinity of small molecules toward receptors. Here, we overcome this low-affinity problem by coating the surface of nanoparticles (NPs) with multiple ligands. Specifically, we explored the use of gold and platinum nanoparticles to increase the binding affinity of Aβ-specific small molecules to inhibit Aβ peptide aggregation into fibrils in vitro. The interactions of bare NPs, free ligands, and NP-bound ligands with Aβ are comprehensively studied via physicochemical methods (spectroscopy, microscopy, immunologic tests) and cell assays. Reduction of thioflavin T fluorescence, as an indicator for β-sheet content, and inhibition of cellular Aβ excretion are even more effective with NP-bound ligands than with the free ligands. The results from this study may have implications in the development of therapeutics for treating Alzheimer's disease.",27404114,,10.1021/acsnano.6b02627,5
Brain network efficiency is influenced by the pathologic source of corticobasal syndrome,"Objective:To apply network-based statistics to diffusion-weighted imaging tractography data and detect Alzheimer disease vs non-Alzheimer degeneration in the context of corticobasal syndrome.Methods:In a cross-sectional design, pathology was confirmed by autopsy or a pathologically validated CSF total tau-to-β-amyloid ratio (T-tau/Aβ). Using structural MRI data, we identify association areas in fronto-temporo-parietal cortex with reduced gray matter density in corticobasal syndrome (n = 40) relative to age-matched controls (n = 40). Using these fronto-temporo-parietal regions of interest, we construct structural brain networks in clinically similar subgroups of individuals with Alzheimer disease (n = 21) or non-Alzheimer pathology (n = 19) by linking these regions by the number of white matter streamlines identified in a deterministic tractography analysis of diffusion tensor imaging data. We characterize these structural networks using 5 graph-based statistics, and assess their relative utility in classifying underlying pathology with leave-one-out cross-validation using a supervised support vector machine.Results:Gray matter density poorly discriminates between Alzheimer disease and non-Alzheimer pathology subgroups with low sensitivity (57%) and specificity (52%). In contrast, a statistic of local network efficiency demonstrates very good discriminatory power, with 85% sensitivity and 84% specificity.Conclusions:Our results indicate that the underlying pathologic sources of corticobasal syndrome can be classified more accurately using graph theoretical statistics derived from patterns of white matter network organization in association cortex than by regional gray matter density alone. These results highlight the importance of a multimodal neuroimaging approach to diagnostic analyses of corticobasal syndrome.",28779011,PMC5649755,10.1212/WNL.0000000000004324,11
A report from the 8th Kuopio Alzheimer Symposium,"The international Kuopio Alzheimer Symposium was organized by the University of Eastern Finland in Kuopio, Finland on June 6-8, 2018 for the 8th time. Approximately 300 researchers in the fields of neuroscience and neurology from 12 different countries around the world gathered to Kuopio to hear and discuss about the latest insights into the mechanisms and comorbidities and novel approaches for diagnosis, prediction, prevention and therapies of Alzheimer's disease and other neurodegenerative diseases. The 2-day international program on June 7-8 included a keynote session, five oral scientific sessions and a poster session.

Validation of machine learning models to detect amyloid pathologies across institutions,"Semi-quantitative scoring schemes like the Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease (CERAD) are the most commonly used method in Alzheimer's disease (AD) neuropathology practice. Computational approaches based on machine learning have recently generated quantitative scores for whole slide images (WSIs) that are highly correlated with human derived semi-quantitative scores, such as those of CERAD, for Alzheimer's disease pathology. However, the robustness of such models have yet to be tested in different cohorts. To validate previously published machine learning algorithms using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and determine if pathological heterogeneity may alter algorithm derived measures, 40 cases from the Goizueta Emory Alzheimer's Disease Center brain bank displaying an array of pathological diagnoses (including AD with and without Lewy body disease (LBD), and / or TDP-43-positive inclusions) and levels of Aβ pathologies were evaluated. Furthermore, to provide deeper phenotyping, amyloid burden in gray matter vs whole tissue were compared, and quantitative CNN scores for both correlated significantly to CERAD-like scores. Quantitative scores also show clear stratification based on AD pathologies with or without additional diagnoses (including LBD and TDP-43 inclusions) vs cases with no significant neurodegeneration (control cases) as well as NIA Reagan scoring criteria. Specifically, the concomitant diagnosis group of AD + TDP-43 showed significantly greater CNN-score for cored plaques than the AD group. Finally, we report that whole tissue computational scores correlate better with CERAD-like categories than focusing on computational scores from a field of view with densest pathology, which is the standard of practice in neuropathological assessment per CERAD guidelines. Together these findings validate and expand CNN models to be robust to cohort variations and provide additional proof-of-concept for future studies to incorporate machine learning algorithms into neuropathological practice.",32345363,PMC7189549,10.1186/s40478-020-00927-4,18
Is resveratrol a prospective therapeutic strategy in the co-association of glucose metabolism disorders and neurodegenerative diseases?,"Objectives:The mechanism behind the progression of Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) to Alzheimer's disease (AD) remains poorly understood. However some evidence pointed out that the co-occurrence of metabolic conditions affecting glucose homeostasis, as type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), may be an important catalyst in this context. Notably, candidate drugs which modulate common pathways in the development of MCI-to-AD mediated by T2DM may offer likely therapy for AD. Nonetheless, limited pharmacological alternatives that modulate common pathways in T2DM, MCI, and AD are available. In the recent decades, studies have shown that resveratrol may act as a neuroprotective compound, but little is known about its potential in improving cognitive and metabolic aspects associated with AD progression mediated by the co-association between TDM2-MCI.Methods:In this review, we discuss possible protective mechanisms of resveratrol on shared pathways associated with AD progression mediated by T2DM-MCI co-occurrence.Results:Some studies indicated that insulin resistance and hyperglycemia may be also a T2DM risk factor for the progression of MCI-to-AD, promoting alterations in metabolic pathways associated with neuronal plasticity, and increasing pro-inflammatory environment. Interestingly, basic research and clinical trials indicate that resveratrol may modulate those pathways, showing a potential neuroprotective effect of this polyphenol.Conclusion:Therefore, there is not enough clinical data supporting the translational therapeutic use of resveratrol in this scenario.",34514962,,10.1080/1028415X.2021.1972514,1
"Role of Tau in Various Tauopathies, Treatment Approaches, and Emerging Role of Nanotechnology in Neurodegenerative Disorders","A few protein kinases and phosphatases regulate tau protein phosphorylation and an imbalance in their enzyme activity results in tau hyper-phosphorylation. Aberrant tau phosphorylation causes tau to dissociate from the microtubules and clump together in the cytosol to form neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), which lead to the progression of neurodegenerative disorders including Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other tauopathies. Hence, targeting hyperphosphorylated tau protein is a restorative approach for treating neurodegenerative tauopathies. The cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk5) and the glycogen synthase kinase (GSK3β) have both been implicated in aberrant tau hyperphosphorylation. The limited transport of drugs through the blood-brain barrier (BBB) for reaching the central nervous system (CNS) thus represents a significant problem in the development of drugs. Drug delivery systems based on nanocarriers help solve this problem. In this review, we discuss the tau protein, regulation of tau phosphorylation and abnormal hyperphosphorylation, drugs in use or under clinical trials, and treatment strategies for tauopathies based on the critical role of tau hyperphosphorylation in the pathogenesis of the disease.

Design and Application of Automated Algorithms for Diagnosis and Treatment Optimization in Neurodegenerative Diseases,"Neurodegenerative diseases represent a growing healthcare problem, mainly related to an aging population worldwide and thus their increasing prevalence. In particular, Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD) are leading neurodegenerative diseases. To aid their diagnosis and optimize treatment, we have developed a classification algorithm for AD to manipulate magnetic resonance images (MRI) stored in a large database of patients, containing 1,200 images. The algorithm can predict whether a patient is healthy, has mild cognitive impairment, or already has AD. We then applied this classification algorithm to therapeutic outcomes in PD after treatment with deep brain stimulation (DBS), to assess which stereotactic variables were the most important to consider when performing surgery in this indication. Here, we describe the stereotactic system used for DBS procedures, and compare different planning methods with the gold standard normally used (i.e., neurophysiological coordinates recorded intraoperatively). We used information collected from database of 72 DBS electrodes implanted in PD patients, and assessed the potentially most beneficial ranges of deviation within planning and neurophysiological coordinates from the operating room, to provide neurosurgeons with additional landmarks that may help to optimize outcomes: we observed that x coordinate deviation within CT scan and gold standard intra-operative neurophysiological coordinates is a robust matric to pre-assess positive therapy outcomes- ""good therapy"" prediction if deviation is higher than 2.5 mm. When being less than 2.5 mm, adding directly calculated variables deviation (on Y and Z axis) would lead to specific assessment of ""very good therapy"".",35262881,,10.1007/s12021-022-09578-3,0
"Tau- and α-synuclein-targeted gold nanoparticles: applications, opportunities, and future outlooks in the diagnosis and therapy of neurodegenerative diseases","The use of nanomaterials in medicine offers multiple opportunities to address neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease. These diseases are a significant burden for society and the health system, affecting millions of people worldwide without sensitive and selective diagnostic methodologies or effective treatments to stop their progression. In this sense, the use of gold nanoparticles is a promising tool due to their unique properties at the nanometric level. They can be functionalized with specific molecules to selectively target pathological proteins such as Tau and α-synuclein for Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease, respectively. Additionally, these proteins are used as diagnostic biomarkers, wherein gold nanoparticles play a key role in enhancing their signal, even at the low concentrations present in biological samples such as blood or cerebrospinal fluid, thus enabling an early and accurate diagnosis. On the other hand, gold nanoparticles act as drug delivery platforms, bringing therapeutic agents directly into the brain, improving treatment efficiency and precision, and reducing side effects in healthy tissues. However, despite the exciting potential of gold nanoparticles, it is crucial to address the challenges and issues associated with their use in the medical field before they can be widely applied in clinical settings. It is critical to ensure the safety and biocompatibility of these nanomaterials in the context of the central nervous system. Therefore, rigorous preclinical and clinical studies are needed to assess the efficacy and feasibility of these strategies in patients. Since there is scarce and sometimes contradictory literature about their use in this context, the main aim of this review is to discuss and analyze the current state-of-the-art of gold nanoparticles in relation to delivery, diagnosis, and therapy for Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease, as well as recent research about their use in preclinical, clinical, and emerging research areas.",38741193,PMC11092257,10.1186/s12951-024-02526-0,0
Neuropathologic evaluation of cerebrovascular disease in patients with rheumatoid arthritis,"Objectives:Active RA has been associated with an increased risk of both cardiovascular and peripheral vascular disease. We aimed to compare cerebrovascular changes in patients with and without RA, both with and without a neuropathologic diagnosis of neurodegenerative disease.Methods:Patients with RA (n = 32) who died and underwent autopsy between 1994 and 2021 were matched to non-RA controls (n = 32) on age, sex and level of neurodegenerative proteinopathy. Routine neuropathologic examination was performed at the time of autopsy. Cerebrovascular disease severity was evaluated using modified Kalaria and Strozyk scales. Clinical dementia diagnoses were manually collected from patients' medical records.Results:Prior to death, 15 (47%) RA patients and 14 (44%) controls were diagnosed with dementia; 9 patients in each group (60% and 64%, respectively) had Alzheimer's disease. The prevalence of cerebral amyloid angiopathy, microinfarcts, infarcts or strokes was found to be similar between groups. Patients with RA were more likely to have more severe vascular changes in the basal ganglia by Kalaria scale (P = 0.04), but not in other brain areas. There were no significant differences in the presence of large infarcts, lacunar infarcts or leukoencephalopathy by Strozyk scale. Among patients with RA and no clinical diagnosis of dementia, the majority had mild-moderate cerebrovascular abnormalities, and a subset of patients had Alzheimer's disease neuropathologic changes.Conclusion:In this small series of autopsies, patients with and without RA had largely similar cerebrovascular pathology when controlling for neurodegenerative proteinopathies, although patients with RA exhibited more pronounced cerebrovascular disease in the basal ganglia.",37871918,,10.1093/rheumatology/kead396,0
omicSynth: An open multi-omic community resource for identifying druggable targets across neurodegenerative diseases,"Treatments for neurodegenerative disorders remain rare, but recent FDA approvals, such as lecanemab and aducanumab for Alzheimer disease (MIM: 607822), highlight the importance of the underlying biological mechanisms in driving discovery and creating disease modifying therapies. The global population is aging, driving an urgent need for therapeutics that stop disease progression and eliminate symptoms. In this study, we create an open framework and resource for evidence-based identification of therapeutic targets for neurodegenerative disease. We use summary-data-based Mendelian randomization to identify genetic targets for drug discovery and repurposing. In parallel, we provide mechanistic insights into disease processes and potential network-level consequences of gene-based therapeutics. We identify 116 Alzheimer disease, 3 amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (MIM: 105400), 5 Lewy body dementia (MIM: 127750), 46 Parkinson disease (MIM: 605909), and 9 progressive supranuclear palsy (MIM: 601104) target genes passing multiple test corrections (pSMR_multi< 2.95 × 10-6and pHEIDI> 0.01). We created a therapeutic scheme to classify our identified target genes into strata based on druggability and approved therapeutics, classifying 41 novel targets, 3 known targets, and 115 difficult targets (of these, 69.8% are expressed in the disease-relevant cell type from single-nucleus experiments). Our novel class of genes provides a springboard for new opportunities in drug discovery, development, and repurposing in the pre-competitive space. In addition, looking at drug-gene interaction networks, we identify previous trials that may require further follow-up such as riluzole in Alzheimer disease. We also provide a user-friendly web platform to help users explore potential therapeutic targets for neurodegenerative diseases, decreasing activation energy for the community.",38181731,PMC10806756,10.1016/j.ajhg.2023.12.006,2
Looking Behind the Curtain: Patient Stratification According to Genetic or Demographic Factors May Yield Unexpected Results in Studies of Neurodegenerative Diseases,"Amyloid-PET studies of neurodegenerative diseases may yield inconclusive findings due to lacking stratification according to genetic or demographic variants. APOEɛ4 alleles are the major variants to increase disease susceptibility and cause earlier onset and more behavioral features in patients with late-onset Alzheimer's disease, but have no linear effects on cognitive or functional decline; thus, sample stratification according to APOEɛ4 carrier status may be the best option. Interactions among APOEɛ4 alleles, sex, and age on amyloid-β deposition may reveal even more innovative findings with sufficiently large samples, suggesting variable genomic effects of cognitive reserve, sex differences, and cerebrovascular risk on neurodegeneration.",37393510,,10.3233/JAD-230561,1
Neuro-degeneration profile of Alzheimer's patients: A brain morphometry study,"Introduction:Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a primary and progressive neurodegenerative disorder, which is marked by cognitive deterioration and memory impairment. Atrophy of hippocampus and other basal brain regions is one of the most predominant structural imaging findings related to AD. Most studies have evaluated the pre-clinical and initial stages of AD through clinical trials using Magnetic Resonance Imaging. Structural biomarkers for advanced AD stages have not been evaluated yet, being considered only hypothetically.Objective:To evaluate the brain morphometry of AD patients at all disease stages, identifying the structural neuro-degeneration profile associated with AD severity.Material and methods:AD patients aged 60 years or over at different AD stages were recruited and grouped into three groups following the Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) score: CDR1 (n = 16), CDR2 (n = 15), CDR3 (n = 13). Age paired healthy volunteers (n = 16) were also recruited (control group). Brain images were acquired on a 3T magnetic resonance scanner using a conventional Gradient eco 3D T1-w sequence without contrast injection. Volumetric quantitative data and cortical thickness were obtained by automatic segmentation using the Freesurfer software. Volume of each brain region was normalized by the whole brain volume in order to minimize age and body size effects. Volume and cortical thickness variations among groups were compared.Results:Atrophy was observed in the hippocampus, amygdala, entorhinal cortex, parahippocampal region, temporal pole and temporal lobe of patients suffering from AD at any stage. Cortical thickness was reduced only in the parahippocampal gyrus at all disease stages. Volume and cortical thickness were correlated with the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) score in all studied regions, as well as with CDR and disease duration.Discussion and conclusion:As previously reported, brain regions affected by AD during its initial stages, such as hippocampus, amygdala, entorhinal cortex, and parahippocampal region, were found to be altered even in individuals with severe AD. In addition, individuals, specifically, with CDR 3, have multiple regions with lower volumes than individuals with a CDR 2. These results indicate that rates of atrophy have not plateaued out at CDR 2-3, and in severe patients there are yet neuronal loss and gliosis. These findings can add important information to the more accepted model in the literature that focuses mainly on early stages. Our findings allow a better understanding on the AD pathophysiologic process and follow-up process of drug treatment even at advanced disease stages.",28459000,PMC5397580,10.1016/j.nicl.2017.04.001,31
Cross Talk Between Aluminum and Genetic Susceptibility and Epigenetic Modification in Alzheimer's Disease,"This chapter primarily focuses on two key aspects related to aluminum neurotoxicity and its mechanism in Alzheimer's disease (AD), which are genetic susceptibility and epigenetic modification. The toxicity of aluminum has been confirmed from plant experiments, animal experiments, in vitro experiments, and epidemiological studies. However, the mechanisms underlying this phenomenon have largely remained elusive. Furthermore, there are more and more genetic factors that have been found to be strongly implicated for causing or increasing the risk of AD development and have been proved to be associated with the neurotoxicity of Al and play a significant role in the initiation and progression of AD. Epigenetics provide a bridge between genes and environment to improve our understanding on the etiology of AD. Al can modify the epigenetic status by DNA methylation, histone modifications, and noncoding RNAs and might thereby contribute to the pathophysiology of AD. However, very little is known about exact epigenetic patterns in AD.",30315455,,10.1007/978-981-13-1370-7_10,5
The Therapeutic Benefits of Intravenously Administrated Nanoparticles in Stroke and Age-related Neurodegenerative Diseases,"The mean global lifetime risk of neurological disorders such as stroke, Alzheimer's disease (AD), and Parkinson's disease (PD) has shown a large effect on economy and society. Researchers are still struggling to find effective drugs to treat neurological disorders and drug delivery through the blood-brain barrier (BBB) is a major challenge to be overcome. The BBB is a specialized multicellular barrier between peripheral blood circulation and neural tissue. Unique and selective features of the BBB allow it to tightly control brain homeostasis as well as the movement of ions and molecules. Failure in maintaining any of these substances causes BBB breakdown and subsequently enhances neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration. BBB disruption is evident in many neurological conditions. Nevertheless, the majority of currently available therapies have tremendous problems with drug delivery into the impaired brain. Nanoparticle (NP)-mediated drug delivery has been considered a profound substitute to solve this problem. NPs are colloidal systems with a size range of 1-1000 nm which can encapsulate therapeutic payloads, improve drug passage across the BBB, and target specific brain areas in neurodegenerative/ischemic diseases. A wide variety of NPs has been displayed for the efficient brain delivery of therapeutics via intravenous administration, especially when their surfaces are coated with targeting moieties. Here, we discuss recent advances in the development of NP-based therapeutics for the treatment of stroke, PD, and AD, as well as the factors affecting their efficacy after systemic administration.",35676838,,10.2174/1381612828666220608093639,4
Clinicopathologic subtype of Alzheimer's disease presenting as corticobasal syndrome,"Introduction:The corticobasal syndrome (CBS) is associated with several neuropathologic disorders, including corticobasal degeneration and Alzheimer's disease (AD).Method:In this report, we studied 43 AD patients with CBS (AD-CBS) and compared them with 42 AD patients with typical amnestic syndrome (AD-AS), as well as 15 cases of corticobasal degeneration and CBS pathology.Results:Unlike AD-AS, AD-CBS had prominent motor problems, including limb apraxia (90%), myoclonus (81%), and gait disorders (70%). Alien limb phenomenon was reported in 26% and cortical sensory loss in 14%. Language problems were also more frequent in AD-CBS, and memory impairment was less frequent. AD-CBS had more tau pathology in perirolandic cortices but less in superior temporal cortex than AD-AS. In addition, AD-CBS had greater neuronal loss in the substantia nigra.Discussion:AD-CBS is a clinicopathological subtype of AD with an atypical distribution of Alzheimer-type tau pathology. Greater neuronal loss in the substantia nigra may contribute to Parkinsonism which is not a feature of typical AD.",31399334,PMC9262170,10.1016/j.jalz.2019.04.011,18
An overview of various mammalian models to study chronic copper intoxication associated Alzheimer's disease like pathology,"Chronic copper toxicity has been long known to cause hepatotoxicity and liver cirrhosis as observed in Wilson's disease; however, substantial evidence accrued over the time have shown considerable increase in animal studies demonstrating Alzheimer's disease like pathology due to chronic copper-intoxication under certain conditions.

"Aluminium in human brain tissue from donors without neurodegenerative disease: A comparison with Alzheimer's disease, multiple sclerosis and autism","A burgeoning number of studies are demonstrating aluminium in human brain tissue. While research has both quantified and imaged aluminium in human brain tissue in neurodegenerative and neurodevelopmental disease there are few similar data for brain tissue from non-neurologically impaired donors. We have used microwave assisted acid digestion and transversely heated graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometry to measure aluminium in twenty brains from donors without recognisable neurodegenerative disease. The aluminium content of 191 tissue samples was invariably low with over 80% of tissues having an aluminium content below 1.0 μg/g dry weight of tissue. The data for these control tissues were compared with data (measured using identical procedures) for sporadic Alzheimer's disease, familial Alzheimer's disease, autism spectrum disorder and multiple sclerosis. Detailed statistical analyses showed that aluminium was significantly increased in each of these disease groups compared to control tissues. We have confirmed previous conclusions that the aluminium content of brain tissue in Alzheimer's disease, autism spectrum disorder and multiple sclerosis is significantly elevated. Further research is required to understand the role played by high levels of aluminium in the aetiology of human neurodegenerative and neurodevelopmental disease.",32385326,PMC7211005,10.1038/s41598-020-64734-6,26
Assessment of suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid on a Alzheimer's disease model induced by β-amyloid(1-42)in aged female mice: Neuromodulatory and epigenetic effect,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease that affects several elderly people per years. AD is a pathology of multifactorial etiology, resulting from multiple environmental and genetic determinants. However, there is no effective pharmacological alternative for the treatment of this illness. In this sense, the purpose of current study was to characterize the mechanisms by which Aβ1-42injection via intracerebroventricular induces neurobehavioral changes in a time-course curve. In addition, suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA) inhibitor of histone deacetylase (HDAC) was used to investigate the involvement of epigenetic modifications Aβ1-42-caused in aged female mice. In general manner, Aβ1-42injection induced a major neurochemical disturbance in hippocampus and prefrontal cortex of animals and a serious impairment of memory. Overall, SAHA treatment attenuated neurobehavioral changes caused by Aβ1-42injection in aged female mice. The subchronic effects presented of SAHA were through modulation of HDAC activity, regulation of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels and expression of BDNF mRNA, accompanied by unlocking cAMP/PKA/pCREB pathway in hippocampus and prefrontal cortex of animals.",36870467,,10.1016/j.cbi.2023.110429,2
Capturing Measures That Matter: The Potential Value of Digital Measures of Physical Behavior for Alzheimer's Disease Drug Development,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a devastating neurodegenerative disease and the primary cause of dementia worldwide. Despite the magnitude of AD's impact on patients, caregivers, and society, nearly all AD clinical trials fail. A potential contributor to this high rate of failure is that established clinical outcome assessments fail to capture subtle clinical changes, entail high burden for patients and their caregivers, and ineffectively address the aspects of health deemed important by patients and their caregivers. AD progression is associated with widespread changes in physical behavior that have impacts on the ability to function independently, which is a meaningful aspect of health for patients with AD and important for diagnosis. However, established assessments of functional independence remain underutilized in AD clinical trials and are limited by subjective biases and ceiling effects. Digital measures of real-world physical behavior assessed passively, continuously, and remotely using digital health technologies have the potential to address some of these limitations and to capture aspects of functional independence in patients with AD. In particular, measures of real-world gait, physical activity, and life-space mobility captured with wearable sensors may offer value. Additional research is needed to understand the validity, feasibility, and acceptability of these measures in AD clinical research.",37545234,PMC10578291,10.3233/JAD-230152,0
Psychosis in Neurodegenerative Dementias: A Systematic Comparative Review,"Background:Psychosis, characterized by delusions and/or hallucinations, is frequently observed during the progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other neurodegenerative dementias (ND) (i.e., dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), and frontotemporal dementia (FTD)) and cause diagnostic and management difficulties.Objective:This review aims at presenting a concise and up-to-date overview of psychotic symptoms that occur in patients with ND with a comparative approach.Methods:A systematic review was conducted following the PRISMA guidelines. 98 original studies investigating psychosis phenotypes in neurodegenerative dementias were identified (40 cohort studies, 57 case reports).Results:Psychosis is a frequently observed phenomenon during the course of ND, with reported prevalence ranging from 22.5% to 54.1% in AD, 55.9% to 73.9% in DLB, and 18% to 42% in FTD. Throughout all stages of these diseases, noticeable patterns emerge depending on their underlying causes. Misidentification delusions (16.6-78.3%) and visual hallucinations (50-69.6%) are frequently observed in DLB, while paranoid ideas and somatic preoccupations seem to be particularly common in AD and FTD, (respectively 9.1-60.3% and 3.10-41.5%). Limited data were found regarding psychosis in the early stages of these disorders.Conclusions:Literature data suggest that different ND are associated with noticeable variations in psychotic phenotypes, reflecting disease-specific tendencies. Further studies focusing on the early stages of these disorders are necessary to enhance our understanding of early psychotic manifestations associated with ND and help in differential diagnosis issues.",38669539,,10.3233/JAD-231363,0
"Polygenic hazard score, amyloid deposition and Alzheimer's neurodegeneration","Mounting evidence indicates that the polygenic basis of late-onset Alzheimer's disease can be harnessed to identify individuals at greatest risk for cognitive decline. We have previously developed and validated a polygenic hazard score comprising of 31 single nucleotide polymorphisms for predicting Alzheimer's disease dementia age of onset. In this study, we examined whether polygenic hazard scores are associated with: (i) regional tracer uptake using amyloid PET; (ii) regional volume loss using longitudinal MRI; (iii) post-mortem regional amyloid-β protein and tau associated neurofibrillary tangles; and (iv) four common non-Alzheimer's pathologies. Even after accounting for APOE, we found a strong association between polygenic hazard scores and amyloid PET standard uptake volume ratio with the largest effects within frontal cortical regions in 980 older individuals across the disease spectrum, and longitudinal MRI volume loss within the entorhinal cortex in 607 older individuals across the disease spectrum. We also found that higher polygenic hazard scores were associated with greater rates of cognitive and clinical decline in 632 non-demented older individuals, even after controlling for APOE status, frontal amyloid PET and entorhinal cortex volume. In addition, the combined model that included polygenic hazard scores, frontal amyloid PET and entorhinal cortex volume resulted in a better fit compared to a model with only imaging markers. Neuropathologically, we found that polygenic hazard scores were associated with regional post-mortem amyloid load and neuronal neurofibrillary tangles, even after accounting for APOE, validating our imaging findings. Lastly, polygenic hazard scores were associated with Lewy body and cerebrovascular pathology. Beyond APOE, we show that in living subjects, polygenic hazard scores were associated with amyloid deposition and neurodegeneration in susceptible brain regions. Polygenic hazard scores may also be useful for the identification of individuals at the highest risk for developing multi-aetiological dementia.",30689776,PMC6351776,10.1093/brain/awy327,40
Effects of COVID-19 on preclinical and clinical research in neurology: Examples from research on neurodegeneration and Alzheimer's disease,"The COVID-19 pandemic has had a profound impact on neuroscientists, including those involved in translational research.

Beyond association: successes and challenges in linking non-coding genetic variation to functional consequences that modulate Alzheimer's disease risk,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common type of dementia, affecting millions of people worldwide; however, no disease-modifying treatments are currently available. Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have identified more than 40 loci associated with AD risk. However, most of the disease-associated variants reside in non-coding regions of the genome, making it difficult to elucidate how they affect disease susceptibility. Nonetheless, identification of the regulatory elements, genes, pathways and cell type/tissue(s) impacted by these variants to modulate AD risk is critical to our understanding of disease pathogenesis and ability to develop effective therapeutics. In this review, we provide an overview of the methods and approaches used in the field to identify the functional effects of AD risk variants in the causal path to disease risk modification as well as describe the most recent findings. We first discuss efforts in cell type/tissue prioritization followed by recent progress in candidate causal variant and gene nomination. We discuss statistical methods for fine-mapping as well as approaches that integrate multiple levels of evidence, such as epigenomic and transcriptomic data, to identify causal variants and risk mechanisms of AD-associated loci. Additionally, we discuss experimental approaches and data resources that will be needed to validate and further elucidate the effects of these variants and genes on biological pathways, cellular phenotypes and disease risk. Finally, we discuss future steps that need to be taken to ensure that AD GWAS functional mapping efforts lead to novel findings and bring us closer to finding effective treatments for this devastating disease.",33882988,PMC8061035,10.1186/s13024-021-00449-0,16
Longitudinal Genotype-Phenotype Association Study through Temporal Structure Auto-Learning Predictive Model,"With the rapid development of high-throughput genotyping and neuroimaging techniques, imaging genetics has drawn significant attention in the study of complex brain diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). Research on the associations between genotype and phenotype improves the understanding of the genetic basis and biological mechanisms of brain structure and function. AD is a progressive neurodegenerative disease; therefore, the study on the relationship between single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) and longitudinal variations of neuroimaging phenotype is crucial. Although some machine learning models have recently been proposed to capture longitudinal patterns in genotype-phenotype association studies, most machine-learning models base the learning on fixed structure among longitudinal prediction tasks rather than automatically learning the interrelationships. In response to this challenge, we propose a new automated time structure learning model to automatically reveal the longitudinal genotype-phenotype interactions and exploits such learned structure to enhance the phenotypic predictions. We proposed an efficient optimization algorithm for our model and provided rigorous theoretical convergence proof. We performed experiments on the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) cohort for longitudinal phenotype prediction, including 3123 SNPs and 2 biomarkers (Voxel-Based Morphometry and FreeSurfer). The empirical results validate that our proposed model is superior to the counterparts. In addition, the best SNPs identified by our model have been replicated in the literature, which justifies our prediction.",30011249,PMC6067099,10.1089/cmb.2018.0008,2
Age-related epigenetic regulation in the brain and its role in neuronal diseases,"Accumulating evidence indicates many brain functions are mediated by epigenetic regulation of neural genes, and their dysregulations result in neuronal disorders. Experiences such as learning and recall, as well as physical exercise, induce neuronal activation through epigenetic modifications and by changing the noncoding RNA profiles. Animal models, brain samples from patients, and the development of diverse analytical methods have broadened our understanding of epigenetic regulation in the brain. Diverse and specific epigenetic changes are suggested to correlate with neuronal development, learning and memory, aging and age-related neuronal diseases. Although the results show some discrepancies, a careful comparison of the data (including methods, regions and conditions examined) would clarify the problems confronted in understanding epigenetic regulation in the brain.

Low levels of aluminum can lead to behavioral and morphological changes associated with Alzheimer's disease and age-related neurodegeneration,"Aluminum (Al) is a very common component of the earth's mineral composition. It is not essential element for life and is a constituent of rather inert minerals. Therefore, it has often been regarded as not presenting a significant health hazard. As a result, aluminum-containing agents been used in the preparation of many foodstuffs processing steps and also in elimination of particulate organic matter from water. More recently, the reduced pH of bodies of water resulting from acid rain has led to mobilization of aluminum-containing minerals into a more soluble form, and these have thus entered residential drinking water resources. By this means, the body burden of aluminum in humans has increased. Epidemiological and experimental findings indicate that aluminum is not as harmless as was previously thought, and that aluminum may contribute to the inception and advancement of Alzheimer's disease. Epidemiological data is reinforced by indications that aluminum exposure can result in excess inflammatory activity within the brain. Activation of the immune system not initiated by an infectious agent, typifies the aging brain and is even more augmented in several neurodegenerative diseases. The origin of most age-related neurological disorders is generally not known but as they are largely not of genetic derivation, their development is likely triggered by unknown environmental factors. There is a growing and consistent body of evidence that points to aluminum as being one such significant influence. Evidence is presented that reinforces the likelihood that aluminum is a factor speeding the rate of brain aging. Such acceleration would inevitably enlarge the incidence of age-related neurological diseases.",26687397,,10.1016/j.neuro.2015.12.002,51
The use of MALDI-MSI in the investigation of psychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders: A review,"Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry imaging (MALDI-MSI) is a mass spectrometry technique used for the analysis of macromolecules on an intact tissue of interest, thereby allowing the assessment of molecular signatures in health and disease in the anatomical context. MALDI-MSI is increasingly used to investigate neurodegenerative and psychiatric disorders at the molecular level, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), and schizophrenia (SCZ). These illnesses are characterized by complex neuropathological processes, and conventional proteomic techniques investigating brain tissue homogenates have inherent limitations in determining the precise anatomical or cellular location of proteomic findings. In this article, we review MALDI-MSI studies on neurodegenerative and psychiatric disorders, and explore whether the technique could accelerate the translation of proteomic information into improved understanding and ultimately better therapeutic applications.",27303929,,10.1002/pmic.201500460,13
Exploring Psychosis in Neurodegenerative Dementia: Connecting Symptoms to Neurobiology,"The following commentary discusses a review by Cressot et al. entitled: 'Psychosis in Neurodegenerative Dementias: A Systematic Comparative Review'. The authors describe the epidemiology and phenomenology of psychosis across neurodegenerative dementias. Dementia with Lewy bodies had the highest reported prevalence of psychosis at 74% followed by Alzheimer's disease, 54% and frontotemporal degeneration, 42%. Detailed characterization of psychosis shows differences in the types of hallucinations and delusions by dementia type. These findings suggest that different types of dementia related pathology are associated with high rates of psychosis with more specific symptom profiles than previously appreciated. Understanding the differences and variety of psychotic experiences across dementia types may have diagnostic and therapeutic implications for treating hallucinations and delusions in populations suffering from neurodegenerative diseases.",38669552,,10.3233/JAD-240328,0
"Translational research on reserve against neurodegenerative disease: consensus report of the International Conference on Cognitive Reserve in the Dementias and the Alzheimer's Association Reserve, Resilience and Protective Factors Professional Interest Area working groups","Background:The concept of reserve was established to account for the observation that a given degree of neurodegenerative pathology may result in varying degrees of symptoms in different individuals. There is a large amount of evidence on epidemiological risk and protective factors for neurodegenerative diseases and dementia, yet the biological mechanisms that underpin the protective effects of certain lifestyle and physiological variables remain poorly understood, limiting the development of more effective preventive and treatment strategies. Additionally, different definitions and concepts of reserve exist, which hampers the coordination of research and comparison of results across studies.Discussion:This paper represents the consensus of a multidisciplinary group of experts from different areas of research related to reserve, including clinical, epidemiological and basic sciences. The consensus was developed during meetings of the working groups of the first International Conference on Cognitive Reserve in the Dementias (24-25 November 2017, Munich, Germany) and the Alzheimer's Association Reserve and Resilience Professional Interest Area (25 July 2018, Chicago, USA). The main objective of the present paper is to develop a translational perspective on putative mechanisms underlying reserve against neurodegenerative disease, combining evidence from epidemiological and clinical studies with knowledge from animal and basic research. The potential brain functional and structural basis of reserve in Alzheimer's disease and other brain disorders are discussed, as well as relevant lifestyle and genetic factors assessed in both humans and animal models.Conclusion:There is an urgent need to advance our concept of reserve from a hypothetical model to a more concrete approach that can be used to improve the development of effective interventions aimed at preventing dementia. Our group recommends agreement on a common dictionary of terms referring to different aspects of reserve, the improvement of opportunities for data sharing across individual cohorts, harmonising research approaches across laboratories and groups to reduce heterogeneity associated with human data, global coordination of clinical trials to more effectively explore whether reducing epidemiological risk factors leads to a reduced burden of neurodegenerative diseases in the population, and an increase in our understanding of the appropriateness of animal models for reserve research.",30808345,PMC6391801,10.1186/s12916-019-1283-z,32
"Novel and Potent Acetylcholinesterase Inhibitors for the Treatment of Alzheimer's Disease from Natural (±)-7,8-Dihydroxy-3-methyl-isochroman-4-one","Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease that causes memory and cognitive decline as well as behavioral problems. It is a progressive and well recognized complex disease; therefore, it is very urgent to develop novel and effective anti-AD drugs. In this study, a series of novel isochroman-4-one derivatives from natural (±)-7,8-dihydroxy-3-methyl-isochroman-4-one [(±)-XJP] were designed and synthesized, and their anti-AD potential was evaluated. Among them, compound10a[(Z)-3-acetyl-1-benzyl-4-((6,7-dimethoxy-4-oxoisochroman-3-ylidene)methyl)pyridin-1-ium bromide] possessed potent anti-acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity as well as modest antioxidant activity. Further molecular modeling and kinetic investigations revealed that compound10awas a dual-binding inhibitor that binds to both catalytic anionic site (CAS) and peripheral anionic site (PAS) of the enzyme AChE. In addition, compound10aexhibited low cytotoxicity and moderate anti-Aβaggregation efficacy. Moreover, the in silico screening suggested that these compounds could pass across the blood-brain barrier with high penetration. These findings show that compound10awas a promising lead from a natural product with potent AChE inhibitory activity and deserves to be further developed for the prevention and treatment of AD.",35630563,PMC9145193,10.3390/molecules27103090,3
Heparan sulfate from porcine mucosa promotes amyloid-beta clearance in APP/PS1 mice and alleviates Alzheimer's pathology,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by memory loss and cognitive impairments. Amyloid-β (Aβ) deposition and neurotoxicity play important roles in AD. It has been widely reported that heparan sulfate (HS) proteoglycans play a nonnegligible role in the release, uptake and misfolding of Aβ, resulting in the discovery of HS as a therapeutic drug for AD. In this manuscript, HS from porcine mucosa could promote Aβ fibrosis and improve the cognitive defects of APPswe/PS1ΔE9 mice. Furthermore, HS enhanced the phagocytosis of neutrophils to clear Aβ1-42from peripheral circulation, reduced peripheral Aβ1-42flow to the brain and increased Aβ efflux from the brain. Therefore, the deposition of Aβ plaques in the brain was decreased. In addition, HS alleviated neutrophil infiltration and reduced neuroinflammation. Conclusively, HS is a promising neuroprotective candidate for AD treatment.",35287845,,10.1016/j.carbpol.2022.119205,0
Trimethylamine N-Oxide Reduces Neurite Density and Plaque Intensity in a Murine Model of Alzheimer's Disease,"Background:Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common aging-associated neurodegenerative disease; nevertheless, the etiology and progression of the disease is still incompletely understood. We have previously shown that the microbially-derived metabolite trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) is elevated in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of individuals with cognitive impairment due to AD and positively correlates with increases in CSF biomarkers for tangle, plaque, and neuronal pathology.Objective:We assessed the direct impact of TMAO on AD progression.Methods:To do so, transgenic 5XFAD mice were supplemented with TMAO for 12 weeks. Neurite density was assessed through quantitative brain microstructure imaging with neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Label-free, quantitative proteomics was performed on cortex lysates from TMAO-treated and untreated animals. Amyloid-β plaques, astrocytes, and microglia were assessed by fluorescent immunohistochemistry and synaptic protein expression was quantified via western blot.Results:Oral TMAO administration resulted in significantly reduced neurite density in several regions of the brain. Amyloid-β plaque mean intensity was reduced, while plaque count and size remained unaltered. Proteomics analysis revealed that TMAO treatment impacted the expression of 30 proteins (1.5-fold cut-off) in 5XFAD mice, including proteins known to influence neuronal health and amyloid-β precursor protein processing. TMAO treatment did not alter astrocyte and microglial response nor cortical synaptic protein expression.Conclusion:These data suggest that elevated plasma TMAO impacts AD pathology via reductions in neurite density.",36155509,PMC9881463,10.3233/JAD-220413,2
Colony Stimulating Factor-1 Receptor: An emerging target for neuroinflammation PET imaging and AD therapy,"Although neuroinflammation is a significant pathogenic feature of many neurologic disorders, its precise function in-vivo is still not completely known. PET imaging enables the longitudinal examination, quantification, and tracking of different neuroinflammation biomarkers in living subjects. Particularly, PET imaging of Microglia, specialised dynamic immune cells crucial for maintaining brain homeostasis in central nervous system (CNS), is crucial for staging the neuroinflammation. Colony Stimulating Factor- 1 Receptor (CSF-1R) PET imaging is a novel method for the quantification of neuroinflammation. CSF-1R is mainly expressed on microglia, and neurodegenerative disorders greatly up-regulate its expression. The present review primarily focuses on the development, pros and cons of all the CSF-1R PET tracers reported for neuroinflammation imaging. Apart from neuroinflammation imaging, CSF-1R inhibitors are also reported for the therapy of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). AD is a prevalent, advancing, and fatal neurodegenerative condition that have the characteristic feature of persistent neuroinflammation and primarily affects the elderly. The aetiology of AD is profoundly influenced by amyloid-beta (Aβ) plaques, intracellular neurofibrillary tangles, and microglial dysfunction. Increasing evidence suggests that CSF-1R inhibitors (CSF-1Ri) can be helpful in preclinical models of neurodegenerative diseases. This review article also summarises the most recent developments of CSF-1Ri-based therapy for AD.",38330850,,10.1016/j.bmc.2024.117628,0
Mitochondria as a target for neuroprotection: implications for Alzheimer´s disease,"Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common form of dementia, is marked by progressive loss of memory and impairment of cognitive ability. Despite decades of intensive research and scientific advances, the intricate pathogenic mechanisms of AD are still not fully understood and, consequently, an effective treatment is yet to be developed. As widely accepted, the alterations of mitochondrial function are actively engaged in a plethora of neurodegenerative diseases, including AD. With growing interest in the mitochondria as a potential target for understanding AD, it has even been hypothesized that deficits in these organelles may be at the heart of the progression of AD itself. Areas covered: The purpose of this review is to summarize relevant studies that suggest a role for mitochondrial (dys)function in AD and to provide a survey on latest developments regarding AD-related mitochondrial therapeutics. Expert commentary: As outlined in a plethora of studies, there is no doubt that mitochondria play a major role in several stages of AD progression. Even though more in-depth studies are needed before pharmaceutical industry can apply such knowledge to human medicine, the continuous advances in AD research field will certainly facilitate and accelerate the development of more effective preventive or therapeutic strategies to fight this devastating disease.",27366815,,10.1080/14737175.2016.1205488,14
Targeting the Beta-2-Adrenergic Receptor and the Risk of Developing Alzheimer's Disease: A Retrospective Inception Cohort Study,"Background:Animal studies suggested that β2-Adrenergic receptors (β2AR) may be a potential target for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD).Objective:This retrospective inception cohort study aimed to assess the association between antagonists and agonists of the β2AR and the risk of starting treatment for AD in older adults.Methods:A retrospective inception cohort study was conducted among older adults who initiated either non-selective βAR antagonists or selective β2AR agonists using the University Groningen IADB.nl prescription database (study period 1994-2019). For each exposed cohort, two reference cohorts (A and B) were matched on age at index date. The main outcome was defined as at least two prescriptions for cholinesterase inhibitors (rivastigmine, galantamine, and donepezil) and/or memantine. Cox proportional hazard regression models were used to estimate hazard ratios (HR).Results:The risk of developing AD was elevated among patients exposed to non-selective βAR antagonists (A: aHR 3.303, 95% CI 1.230-8.869, B: aHR 1.569, 95% CI 0.560-4.394) and reduced among patients exposed to selective β2AR agonists (A: aHR 0.049, 95% CI 0.003-0.795, B: aHR 0.834, 95% CI 0.075-9.273) compared to reference patients.Conclusion:These findings suggest that exposure to non-selective βAR antagonists is associated with an increased risk for developing AD whereas there may be a decreased risk for developing AD after exposure to selective β2AR agonists.",35466934,PMC9198755,10.3233/JAD-215057,1
Identification and Prioritization of PET Neuroimaging Targets for Microglial Phenotypes Associated with Microglial Activity in Alzheimer's Disease,"Activation of microglial cells accompanies the progression of many neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). Development of molecular imaging tools specific to microglia can help elucidate the mechanism through which microglia contribute to the pathogenesis and progression of neurodegenerative disorders. Through analysis of published genetic, transcriptomic, and proteomic data sets, we identified 19 genes with microglia-specific expression that we then ranked based on association with the AD characteristics, change in expression, and potential druggability of the target. We believe that the process we used to identify and rank microglia-specific genes is broadly applicable to the identification and evaluation of targets in other disease areas and for applications beyond molecular imaging.",36473177,,10.1021/acschemneuro.2c00607,2
Lightweight neural network for Alzheimer's disease classification using multi-slice sMRI,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease. Early detection and intervention are crucial in preventing the progression of AD. To achieve efficient and scalable AD auto-detection based on structural Magnetic Resonance Imaging (sMRI), a lightweight neural network using multi-slice sMRI is proposed in this paper. The backbone for feature extraction is based on ShuffleNet V1 architecture, which is effective for overcoming the limitations posed by limited sMRI data and resource-restricted devices. In addition, we incorporate Efficient Channel Attention (ECA) to capture cross-channel interaction information, enabling us to effectively enhance features of disease associated brain regions. To optimize the model, we employ both cross entropy loss and triplet loss functions to constrain the predicted probabilities to the ground-truth labels, and to ensure appropriate representation of distances between different classes in the learned features. Experimental results show that the classification accuracies of our method for AD vs. CN, AD vs. MCI, and MCI vs. CN classification tasks are 95.00%, 87.50%, and 85.62% respectively. Our method utilizes only 3.42 M parameters and 6.08G FLOPs, while maintaining a comparable level of performance compared to the other 5 latest lightweight methods. This model design is computationally efficient, allowing it to process large amounts of data quickly and accurately in a timely manner. Additionally, it has the potential to advance the intelligent detection of Alzheimer's disease on devices with limited computing capabilities.",38176576,,10.1016/j.mri.2023.12.010,0
Encoding the Sequence of Specific Autoantibodies Against beta-Amyloid and alpha-Synuclein in Neurodegenerative Diseases,"There is no effective disease-modifying therapy for Alzheimer's or Parkinson's disease. As pathological hallmarks, the specific peptide amyloid-β and the specific protein α-Synuclein aggregate and deposit in and destabilize neurons, which lead to their degeneration. Within the context of a potential immunization strategy for these diseases, naturally occurring autoantibodies could play a crucial role in treatment due to their ability to inhibit peptide/protein aggregation and mediate their phagocytosis. We developed a procedure to extract the genetic information of such amyloid-β- and α-Synuclein- specific naturally occurring autoantibodies for future passive immunization strategies. We performed FACS-based single-cell sorting on whole blood donated from healthy individuals and performed single-cell RT-PCR analysis to amplify the coding sequences of antigen-binding regions of each antibody-secreting B1 cell. Sequences were further analyzed to determine CDR sequences and germline expression. Therefore, only low percentages of B1 cells obtained were amyloid-β+/α-Synuclein+. After cell sorting, the variable regions of full IgGs were sequenced, demonstrating preferred usage of IGVH3 and IGKV1. The study we present herein describes an approaching for extracting and amplifying the sequence information of autoantibodies based on single-cell analysis of donated blood and producing a recombinant antibody pool for potential passive immunization against neurodegenerative diseases. We sorted a small pool of CD20+CD27+CD43+CD69-IgG+and Aβ+/α-Syn+B cells.",31507618,PMC6718452,10.3389/fimmu.2019.02033,4
Random forest-integrated analysis in AD and LATE brain transcriptome-wide data to identify disease-specific gene expression,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex neurodegenerative disorder that affects thinking, memory, and behavior. Limbic-predominant age-related TDP-43 encephalopathy (LATE) is a recently identified common neurodegenerative disease that mimics the clinical symptoms of AD. The development of drugs to prevent or treat these neurodegenerative diseases has been slow, partly because the genes associated with these diseases are incompletely understood. A notable hindrance from data analysis perspective is that, usually, the clinical samples for patients and controls are highly imbalanced, thus rendering it challenging to apply most existing machine learning algorithms to directly analyze such datasets. Meeting this data analysis challenge is critical, as more specific disease-associated gene identification may enable new insights into underlying disease-driving mechanisms and help find biomarkers and, in turn, improve prospects for effective treatment strategies. In order to detect disease-associated genes based on imbalanced transcriptome-wide data, we proposed an integrated multiple random forests (IMRF) algorithm. IMRF is effective in differentiating putative genes associated with subjects having LATE and/or AD from controls based on transcriptome-wide data, thereby enabling effective discrimination between these samples. Various forms of validations, such as cross-domain verification of our method over other datasets, improved and competitive classification performance by using identified genes, effectiveness of testing data with a classifier that is completely independent from decision trees and random forests, and relationships with prior AD and LATE studies on the genes linked to neurodegeneration, all testify to the effectiveness of IMRF in identifying genes with altered expression in LATE and/or AD. We conclude that IMRF, as an effective feature selection algorithm for imbalanced data, is promising to facilitate the development of new gene biomarkers as well as targets for effective strategies of disease prevention and treatment.",34492068,PMC8423259,10.1371/journal.pone.0256648,4
Estimating the longitudinal trajectory of cognitive function measurement using short-term data with different disease stages: Application in Alzheimer's disease,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a chronic neurodegenerative disease characterized by a gradual decline in cognitive function over a few decades. The Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) is a widely used measure for evaluating global cognitive functioning. Characterizing the longitudinal trajectory of the MMSE in the population of interest is important to detect AD onset for preventive intervention. In this study, we formulate a new class of longitudinal trajectory modeling for MMSE from short-term individual data based on an ordinary differential equation. The proposed method models the relationship between individual decline speed of MMSE and the average MMSE using the fractional polynomial function model and subsequently estimates the longitudinal trajectory of MMSE by solving the ordinary differential equation for the estimated model. The appropriate model for trajectory estimation is selected based on the proposed criterion for quantifying the goodness of trajectory fit. The accuracy of the trajectory estimation of the proposed method was demonstrated via simulation studies. The proposed method was successfully applied to MMSE data from the Japanese Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative study.",35749990,,10.1002/sim.9504,0
"Epilepsy in Neurodegenerative Dementias: A Clinical, Epidemiological, and EEG Study","Background:Seizures are common in patients with dementia but precise epidemiologic data of epilepsy in neurodegenerative dementia is lacking.Objective:The first aim of the study was to investigate prevalence and clinical characteristics of epilepsy in a large cohort of patients with neurodegenerative dementias. Subsequently, we explored clinical, neuropsychological, and quantitative electroencephalogram (qEEG) data of Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients with epilepsy (AD-EPI) as compared to AD patients without epilepsy (AD-CTR).Methods:We retrospectively evaluated consecutive patients with a diagnosis of a neurodegenerative dementia and a clinically diagnosed epilepsy that required antiepileptic drugs (AED). All patients underwent baseline comprehensive neuropsychological assessment. A follow-up of at least one year was requested to confirm the dementia diagnosis. In AD patients, qEEG power band analysis was performed. AD-CTR and AD-EPI patients were matched for age, Mini-Mental State Examination score, and gender.Results:Thirty-eight out of 2,054 neurodegenerative dementia patients had epilepsy requiring AED. The prevalence of epilepsy was 1.82% for AD, 1.28% for the behavioral variant of frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD), 2.47% for dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), and 12% for primary progressive aphasia. Epilepsy were more drug-responsive in AD than in non-AD dementias. Finally, no significant differences were found in neuropsychological and qEEG data between AD-EPI and AD-CTR patients.Conclusion:In our cohort, AD, FTD, and DLB dementias have similar prevalence of epilepsy, even if AD patients were more responsive to AED. Moreover, AD-EPI patients did not have significant clinical, neuropsychological qEEG differences compared with AD-CTR patients.",32116260,,10.3233/JAD-191315,9
ADmeth: A Manually Curated Database for the Differential Methylation in Alzheimer's Disease,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disease. More and more evidence show that DNA methylation is closely related to the pathological mechanism of AD. Many AD-associated differentially methylated genes, regions and CpG sites have been identified in recent researches, which may have great potential in clinical research. However, there is no dedicated database to collect AD-related differential methylation up to now. To provide a reference to researchers, we design a database named ADmeth by manually curating relevant articles, which contains a total of 16,709 AD-related differentially methylated items identified from different brain regions and different cell types in the blood, involving 209 genes, 2,229 regions and 14,271 CpG sites. The ADmeth database provides user-friendly pages to search, submit and download data. We hope that the ADmeth database can facilitate researchers to select candidate AD-associated methylation markers in revealing the pathological mechanism of AD and promote the cell-free DNA based non-invasive diagnosis of AD. The ADmeth database is available at http://www.biobdlab.cn/ADmeth.",35617175,,10.1109/TCBB.2022.3178087,2
Novel Ultrasensitive Detection Technologies for the Identification of Early and Minimally Invasive Alzheimer's Disease Blood Biomarkers,"Background:Single molecule array (SIMOA) and other ultrasensitive detection technologies have allowed the determination of blood-based biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease (AD) for diagnosis and monitoring, thereby opening up a promising field of research.Objective:To review the published bibliography on plasma biomarkers in AD using new ultrasensitive techniques.Methods:A systematic review of the PubMed database was carried out to identify reports on the use of blood-based ultrasensitive technology to identify biomarkers for AD.Results:Based on this search, 86 works were included and classified according to the biomarker determined. First, plasma amyloid-β showed satisfactory accuracy as an AD biomarker in patients with a high risk of developing dementia. Second, plasma t-Tau displayed good sensitivity in detecting different neurodegenerative diseases. Third, plasma p-Tau was highly specific for AD. Fourth, plasma NfL was highly sensitive for distinguishing between patients with neurodegenerative diseases and healthy controls. In general, the simultaneous determination of several biomarkers facilitated greater accuracy in diagnosing AD (Aβ42/Aβ40, p-Tau181/217).Conclusion:The recent development of ultrasensitive technology allows the determination of blood-based biomarkers with high sensitivity, thus facilitating the early detection of AD through the analysis of easily obtained biological samples. In short, as a result of this knowledge, pre-symptomatic and early AD diagnosis may be possible, and the recruitment process for future clinical trials could be more precise. However, further studies are necessary to standardize levels of blood-based biomarkers in the general population and thus achieve reproducible results among different laboratories.",35213367,,10.3233/JAD-215093,1
Structural Brain Magnetic Resonance Imaging to Rule Out Comorbid Pathology in the Assessment of Alzheimer's Disease Dementia: Findings from the Ontario Neurodegenerative Disease Research Initiative (ONDRI) Study and Clinical Trials Over the Past 10 Years,"Background/objective:Structural brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is not mandatory in Alzheimer's disease (AD) research or clinical guidelines. We aimed to explore the use of structural brain MRI in AD/mild cognitive impairment (MCI) trials over the past 10 years and determine the frequency with which inclusion of standardized structural MRI acquisitions detects comorbid vascular and non-vascular pathologies.Methods:We systematically searched ClinicalTrials.gov for AD clinical trials to determine their neuroimaging criteria and then used data from an AD/MCI cohort who underwent standardized MRI protocols, to determine type and incidence of clinically relevant comorbid pathologies.Results:Of 210 AD clinical trials, 105 (50%) included structural brain imaging in their eligibility criteria. Only 58 (27.6%) required MRI. 16,479 of 53,755 (30.7%) AD participants were in trials requiring MRI. In the observational AD/MCI cohort, 141 patients met clinical criteria; 22 (15.6%) had relevant MRI findings, of which 15 (10.6%) were exclusionary for the study.Discussion:In AD clinical trials over the last 10 years, over two-thirds of participants could have been enrolled without brain MRI and half without even a brain CT. In a study sample, relevant comorbid pathology was found in 15% of participants, despite careful screening. Standardized structural MRI should be incorporated into NIA-AA diagnostic guidelines (when available) and research frameworks routinely to reduce diagnostic heterogeneity.",32116253,PMC7242844,10.3233/JAD-191097,2
Diagnostic accuracy of the UDS 3.0 neuropsychological battery in a cohort with Alzheimer's disease in Colombia,"Background:Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease that causes a gradual loss of cognitive functions and limits daily activities performance. Early diagnosis of AD is essential to start timely treatment. This study aimed to validate the Uniform Data Set neuropsychological battery version 3.0 (UDS 3.0) in a Colombian cohort.Methods:This study is a cross-sectional type, consecutive, incidental, with 143 persons, divided into two groups: 48 diagnosed AD cases and 95 healthy controls, between the ages of 50 and 80+, and between 1 and 19+ years of education.Results:The results indicate differences between the control group and the AD group in most battery tests. A significant correlation was found between the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), Multilingual Naming Test (MINT), Craft Story, Benson Figure Test, P-word and F-word Phonemic Fluency Test, and their respective reference tests. Cutoff points were found based on the Youden index for each sub-test. The results indicate that all sub-tests are above the reference line of the ROC curve.Conclusion:The use of the UDS 3.0 in Colombia would help improving clinical diagnostic routes because of its high accuracy and high correlation with tests that measure general impairment; it has good sensitivity and specificity, and it can be a useful tool for AD.",33761292,,10.1080/23279095.2021.1897007,2
Neuroprotective effect and potential of cellular prion protein and its cleavage products for treatment of neurodegenerative disorders part II: strategies for therapeutics development,"Introduction:The cellular prion protein (PrPC), some of its derivatives (especially PrP N-terminal N1 peptide and shed PrP), and PrPC-containing exosomes have strong neuroprotective activities, which have been reviewed in the companion article (Part I) and are briefly summarized here.Areas covered:We propose that elevating the extracellular levels of a protective PrP form using gene therapy and other approaches is a very promising novel avenue for prophylactic and therapeutic treatments against prion disease, Alzheimer's disease, and several other neurodegenerative diseases. We will dissect the pros and cons of various potential PrP-based treatment options and propose a few strategies that are more likely to succeed. The cited references were obtained from extensive PubMed searches of recent literature, including peer-reviewed original articles and review articles.Expert opinion:Concurrent knockdown of celllular PrP expression and elevation of the extracellular levels of a neuroprotective PrP N-terminal peptide via optimized gene therapy vectors is a highly promising broad-spectrum prophylactic and therapeutic strategy against several neurodegenerative diseases, including prion diseases, Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease.",34470554,PMC8453096,10.1080/14737175.2021.1965882,1
Examining Sex Differences in Markers of Cognition and Neurodegeneration in Autosomal Dominant Alzheimer's Disease: Preliminary Findings from the Colombian Alzheimer's Prevention Initiative Biomarker Study,"Background:Growing evidence suggests that there may be a sex-specific biological risk for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Individuals with autosomal dominant AD due to a mutation (E280A) in Presenilin-1 (PSEN1) are genetically determined to develop early-onset dementia and thus, have few age-related risk factors for AD that are known to vary by sex (i.e., cardiovascular disease, menopause, life expectancy).Objective:Investigate sex differences in markers of cognition and neurodegeneration in autosomal dominant AD.Methods:We conducted a retrospective study in 19 cognitively-unimpaired PSEN1 mutation carriers (age range 20-44; 11 females), 11 symptomatic carriers (age range 42-56; 8 females), and 23 matched non-carriers family members (age range 20-50; 13 females). We examined hippocampal volume ratio, CERAD Total Score, and CERAD Word List (i.e., Learning, Delayed Recall, and Recognition). Mann-Whitney U tests, Spearman correlations and regression models were conducted.Results:There were no differential associations between age, CERAD Total Score, CERAD Word List-Learning, Delayed Recall, Recognition, and hippocampal volume ratio in male and female carriers and non-carriers. Cognitively-unimpaired female carriers showed better CERAD Total scores and CERAD Word List-Learning than cognitively-unimpaired male carriers, despite having similar hippocampal volume ratios. The interaction of sex and hippocampal volume ratio did not predict cognitive performance across groups.Conclusion:Our preliminary findings suggest that cognitively-unimpaired female carriers showed a verbal memory reserve, and as disease progresses, female carriers did not exhibit a cognitive susceptibility to AD-related neurodegeneration. Future studies with larger samples of autosomal dominant AD are warranted to further understand sex differences in AD-related clinical and pathological markers.",32925067,PMC8075106,10.3233/JAD-200723,12
Okadaic Acid-Induced Alzheimer's in Rat Brain: Phytochemical Cucurbitacin E Contributes to Memory Gain by Reducing TAU Protein Accumulation,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by progressive memory loss and cognitive decline, with hallmark pathologies related to amyloid beta (Aβ) and TAU. Natural phytochemicals show promise for drug discovery to fill the current therapeutic innovation gap in AD. This study investigated the effect of cucurbitacin E (CuE), one of the bioactive components ofEcballium elaterium, on TAU fibril formation in okadaic acid-induced AD in rats. In a randomized design, we assigned 30 femaleSprague Dawleyrats to one of five experimental groups: (1) control, (2) stereotaxic surgery, (3) stereotaxic surgery + artificial cerebrospinal fluid, (4) stereotaxic surgery + okadaic acid (AD model), and (5) stereotaxic surgery + okadaic acid + CuE treatment. For experimental groups 4 and 5, rats were administered OKA-ICV (200 ng/kg) followed by CuE (4 mg/[kg·day], intraperitoneally) for 20 days. Expression of theMAPK1/3andMAPK14genes associated with TAU metabolism, hippocampal protein levels of these genes, cognitive functions of the rats, and histological accumulation of TAU in the brain were evaluated. Our findings in this preclinical model collectively suggest that phytochemical CuE contributes to memory gain by reducing TAU protein accumulation, which warrants further evaluation in futurein vitroandin vivostudies.",36594931,,10.1089/omi.2022.0175,1
Biomarkers of Alzheimer's Disease Associated with Programmed Cell Death Reveal Four Repurposed Drugs,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder and the most common cause of dementia. Programmed cell death (PCD) is mainly characterized by unique morphological features and energy-dependent biochemical processes. The predominant pathway leading to cell death in AD has not been thoroughly analyzed, although there is evidence of neuron loss in AD and numerous pathways of PCD have been associated with this process. A better understanding of the systems biology underlying the relationship between AD and PCD could lead to the development of new therapeutic approaches. To this end, publicly available transcriptome data were examined using bioinformatic methods such as differential gene expression and weighted gene coexpression network analysis (WGCNA) to find PCD-related AD biomarkers. The diagnostic significance of these biomarkers was evaluated using a logistic regression-based predictive model. Using these biomarkers, a multifactorial regulatory network was developed. Last, a drug repositioning study was conducted to propose new drugs for the treatment of AD targeting PCD. The development of 3PM (predictive, preventive, and personalized) drugs for the treatment of AD would be enabled by additional research on the effects of these drugs on this disease.",38700745,,10.1007/s12031-024-02228-0,0
Cyclic dipeptide-based small molecules modulate zinc-mediated liquid-liquid phase separation of tau,"Liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) is a complex physicochemical phenomenon mediated by multivalent transient weak interactions among macromolecules like polymers, proteins, and nucleic acids. It has implications in cellular physiology and disease conditions like cancer and neurodegenerative disorders. Many proteins associated with neurodegenerative disorders like RNA binding protein FUS (FUsed in Sarcoma), alpha-synuclein (α-Syn), TAR DNA binding protein 43 (TDP-43), and tau are shown to undergo LLPS. Recently, the tau protein responsible for Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other tauopathies is shown to phase separate into condensates in vitro and in vivo. The diverse noncovalent interactions among the biomolecules dictate the complex LLPS phenomenon. There are limited chemical tools to modulate protein LLPS which has therapeutic potential for neurodegenerative disorders. We have rationally designed cyclic dipeptide (CDP)-based small-molecule modulators (SMMs) by integrating multiple chemical groups that offer diverse chemical interactions to modulate tau LLPS. Among them, compound 1c effectively inhibits and dissolves Zn-mediated tau LLPS condensates. The SMM also inhibits tau condensate-to-fibril transition (tau aggregation through LLPS). This approach of designing SMMs of LLPS establishes a novel platform that has potential implication for the development of therapeutics for neurodegenerative disorders.",36471564,,10.1002/psc.3465,2
Classics in Neuroimaging: Untangling the Role of Tau in Neurodegenerative Disorders Using Positron Emission Tomography,"Imaging of misfolded proteins implicated in neurodegenerative disorders using positron emission tomography (PET) imaging has revolutionized dementia research. In this viewpoint, the development of radiotracers for tau PET is highlighted. We draw attention to key innovations that were essential to development of radiotracers for imaging tau, from early imaging agents, through the structure-activity relationship (SAR) studies required to minimize off-target binding of the newer probes in use today. We also highlight development of Tauvid, the first tau PET radiotracer approved by the US FDA for tau imaging in adult patients with cognitive impairment who are being evaluated for Alzheimer's disease.",36112411,,10.1021/acschemneuro.2c00519,0
Lactobacillusprobiotics improved the gut microbiota profile of aDrosophila melanogasterAlzheimer's disease model and alleviated neurodegeneration in the eye,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive disease and one of the most common forms of neurodegenerative disorders. Emerging evidence is supporting the use of various strategies that modulate gut microbiota to exert neurological and psychological changes. This includes the utilisation of probiotics as a natural and dietary intervention for brain health. Here, we showed the potential AD-reversal effects ofLactobacillusprobiotics through feeding to ourDrosophila melanogasterAD model. The administration ofLactobacillusstrains was able to rescue the rough eye phenotype (REP) seen in AD-inducedDrosophila, with a more prominent effect observed upon the administration ofLactobacillus plantarumDR7 (DR7). Furthermore, we analysed the gut microbiota of the AD-inducedDrosophilaand found elevated levels ofWolbachia. The administration of DR7 restored the gut microbiota diversity of AD-inducedDrosophilawith a significant reduction inWolbachia's relative abundance, accompanied by an increase ofStenotrophomonasandAcetobacter. Through functional predictive analyses,Wolbachiawas predicted to be positively correlated with neurodegenerative disorders, such as Parkinson's, Huntington's and Alzheimer's diseases, whileStenotrophomonaswas negatively correlated with these neurodegenerative disorders. Altogether, our data exhibited DR7's ability to ameliorate the AD effects in our AD-inducedDrosophila. Thus, we propose thatWolbachiabe used as a potential biomarker for AD.",32066253,,10.3920/BM2019.0086,35
"The phenotypical core of Alzheimer's disease-related and nonrelated variants of the corticobasal syndrome: A systematic clinical, neuropsychological, imaging, and biomarker study","Introduction:The corticobasal syndrome (CBS) constitutes a neurodegenerative disease spectrum with substantial phenotypical or biological heterogeneity, requiring large or multimodal studies to identify its clinico-biological signature while disentangling Alzheimer's disease (AD)-related from non-AD-related CBS.Methods:We analyzed a large (N = 45) monocenter expert-clinic CBS cohort, recruited in motor and/or cognitive units to avoid recruitment biases, assessed with standardized motor and/or cognitive-language tests, brain perfusion imaging, and cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers.Results:CBS mainly manifests as a motor and/or language disorder incorporating a ""mixed progressive aphasia"" phenotype, consistent with left-lateralized damage to frontal-parietal-temporal cortices. Biomarker expression indicates in 18% underlying AD causing predominant parietal-temporal damage and Gerstmann syndrome (sensitivity 75%; specificity 75%), whereas non-AD-CBS presented with predominant prefrontal and lexical-semantic impairment.Discussion:CBS is primarily a ""motor-plus-aphasia"" disease unfolding into AD-related and non-AD-related variants with distinctive cognitive-anatomic patterns. CBS, and notably its ""Gerstmann variant"", should be included in the new AD ""lexicon"" and categorized in the evolving diagnostic spectrum of ""atypical AD""d.",26988428,,10.1016/j.jalz.2016.02.005,11
Quantitative Measurement of Tau Aggregation in Genetically Modified Rats with Neurodegeneration,"Animal models of neurodegenerative diseases have helped us to better understand the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases. However, recent failure to translate pre-clinical model studies to the clinic urges us to develop more rigorous and faithful animal models in neurodegenerative diseases. As genetic manipulation of rats becomes much more accessible due to availability of CRISPR-Cas9 and other genomic editing toolboxes, rats have been emerging as a new model system for neurodegenerative diseases. Even though mouse models have been dominant over the last decades, rats may provide advantages over mice. Rats are more genetically and physiologically closer to humans than to mice. Also, certain rat models can represent deposition of tau, which is one of the key pathological features of Alzheimer's diseases and tauopathies. However, there is an unmet need for standardized, rigorous testing in rat models. We adopted two commonly used biochemical and immunofluorescence methods from mice and human postmortem brains to measure tau aggregation. Due to the intrinsic differences between mice and rats, e.g., size of rat brains, certain equipment is required for rat models to study tau pathologies. Along with specific tools, here we describe the detailed methods for rat models of neurodegenerative diseases.",38427245,,10.1007/978-1-0716-3662-6_21,0
Investigating hypotheses of neurodegeneration by learning dynamical systems of protein propagation in the brain,"We introduce a theoretical framework for estimating, comparing and interpreting mechanistic hypotheses on long term protein propagation across brain networks in neurodegenerative disorders (ND). The model is expressed within a Bayesian non-parametric regression setting, where mechanisms of protein dynamics are inferred by means of gradient matching on dynamical systems (DS). The Bayesian formalism, combined with stochastic variational inference, naturally allows for model comparison via assessment of model evidence, while providing uncertainty quantification of causal relationship underlying protein progressions. When applied to in-vivo AV45-PET brain imaging data measuring topographic amyloid deposition in Alzheimer's disease (AD), our model identified the mechanisms of accumulation, clearance and propagation as the best suited DS for bio-mechanical description of amyloid dynamics in AD, enabling realistic and accurate personalized simulation of amyloidosis.",33823273,,10.1016/j.neuroimage.2021.117980,3
Structure-constrained combination-based nonlinear association analysis between incomplete multimodal imaging and genetic data for biomarker detection of neurodegenerative diseases,"Multimodal imaging data are widely applied in imaging genetic studies to identify associations between imaging and genetic data for the biomarker detection of neurodegenerative diseases (NDs). However, the incomplete multimodal imaging data and complex relationships among imaging and genetic data make it difficult to effectively analyze associations between imaging and genetic data and accurately detect disease-related biomarkers. This study proposed a novel structure-constrained combination-based nonlinear association analysis method to exploit associations between incomplete multimodal imaging and genetic data for potential biomarker detection of NDs. Two types of structure constraints were used in imaging and genetic data. First, a parallel concatenated projection method with multiple constraints was adopted to handle missing data. Modality-shared and modality-specific information could be well captured to obtain latent imaging representations. A locality preserving constraint was applied to the imaging data for retaining structure information before and after projection. A connectivity penalty was also included to capture structure associations among latent imaging representations. Second, a group-induced graph self-expression constraint was incorporated into our method to exploit strong structure correlations among inter- and intra-group of genetic data. Finally, a nonlinear kernel-based method was used to explore the complex associations between latent imaging representations and genetic data for biomarker detection. A set of simulation data and two sets of real ND data, which were obtained from Alzheimer's disease neuroimaging initiative and Parkinson's progression markers initiative databases, were applied to assess the effectiveness of our method. High accuracy of biomarker detection was achieved. Moreover, the identification of disease-related biomarkers was confirmed in previous studies. Therefore, our method may provide a novel way to gain insights into the pathological mechanism of NDs and early prediction of these diseases.",35354107,,10.1016/j.media.2022.102419,1
Abnormal interaction of Rlip with mutant APP/Abeta and phosphorylated tau reduces wild-type Rlip levels and disrupt Rlip function in Alzheimer's disease,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease that affects a large proportion of the aging population. RalBP1 (Rlip) is a stress-activated protein, that plays an important role in aging and neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease. Mutant APP and mutant Tau interact with the Rlip protein which leads to decreased wild-type Rlip levels and disrupt Rlip function in Alzheimer's disease. Rlip is a promising new target for aging, Alzheimer's disease, and other neurological diseases.",37633469,,10.1016/j.bbadis.2023.166858,0
Association of TMEM106B with CorticalAPOEGene Expression in Neurodegenerative Conditions,"The e4 allele of the apolipoprotein E gene is the strongest genetic risk factor for sporadic Alzheimer's disease. Nevertheless, howAPOEis regulated is still elusive. In atrans-eQTL analysis, we found a genome-wide significant association between transmembrane protein 106B (TMEM106B) genetic variants and corticalAPOEmRNA levels in human brains. The goal of this study is to determine whether TMEM106B is mis-regulated in Alzheimer's disease or in other neurodegenerative conditions. Available genomic, transcriptomic and proteomic data from human brains were downloaded from the Mayo Clinic Brain Bank and the Religious Orders Study and Memory and Aging Project. An in-house mouse model of the hippocampal deafferentation/reinnervation was achieved via a stereotaxic lesioning surgery to the entorhinal cortex, and mRNA levels were measured using RNAseq technology. In human temporal cortices, the mean TMEM106B expression was significantly higher in Alzheimer's disease compared to cognitively unimpaired individuals. In the mouse model, hippocampalTmem106breached maximum levels during the early phase of reinnervation. These results suggest an active response to tissue damage that is consistent with compensatory synaptic and terminal remodeling.",38674351,PMC11049136,10.3390/genes15040416,0
[Research progress on the mechanism of acupuncture intervention on Alzheimer's disease],"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a common neurodegenerative disease in the elderly. Studies have shown that acupuncture can effectively alleviate the symptoms of AD and slow down the disease progression, and its mechanism has been intensively explored. This paper summarized the researches on the mechanism of acupuncture intervention on AD in the past 5 years. It has been found that acupuncture intervention on AD is correlated with the regulation of the expression levels of relevant proteins, the inhibition of central inflammatory response, the resistance to oxidative stress injury, the modulation of brain energy metabolism, the improvement of neuronal synaptic plasticity, the adjustment of autophagy activity and the suppression of neuronal apoptosis.",35486017,,10.13702/j.1000-0607.20210480,2
Vulnerability of Spatial Pattern Separation in 5xFAD Alzheimer's Disease Mouse Model,"Background:Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia and remains incurable. This age-related neurodegenerative disease is characterized by an early decline in episodic and spatial memory associated with progressive disruption of the hippocampal functioning. Recent clinical evidence suggests that impairment of the spatial pattern separation (SPS) function, which enables the encoding and storage of episodic spatial information, may be an indicator of the early stages of AD.Objective:The aim of our study was to characterize SPS performance at a prodromal stage in 5xFAD transgenic mouse model of AD.Methods:Behavioral performance of male wild-type (WT) and 5xFAD mice (n = 14 per group) was assessed from the age of 4 months in two validated paradigms of SPS function either based on spontaneous exploration of objects or on the use of a touchscreen system.Results:Compared with age-matched WT littermates, a mild deficit in SPS function was observed in the object recognition task in 5xFAD mice, whereas both groups showed similar performance in the touchscreen-based task. These results were observed in the absence of changes in locomotor activity or anxiety-like behavior that could have interfered with the tasks assessing SPS function.Conclusions:Our results indicate an early vulnerability of the SPS function in 5xFAD mice in the paradigm based on spontaneous exploration of objects. Our work opens up the possibility of examining the early neurobiological processes involved in the decline of episodic memory and may help to propose new therapeutic strategies in the context of AD.",38306047,,10.3233/JAD-231112,0
MicroRNA-511-3p regulates Aβ1-40induced decreased cell viability and serves as a candidate biomarker in Alzheimer's disease,"Background:Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease with high incidence in the elderly population. MicroRNAs have been reported to abnormally expressed in patients with AD. In this study, we investigated the role of inflammation-related miR-511-3p in AD patients and AD cell models.Method:The level of miR-511-3p was quantified by Real-Time PCR. The diagnostic value was evaluated by receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) analysis. The correlation between miR-511-3p expression levels and ini-mental state examination (MMSE) scores, Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) scores and inflammatory factors was analyzed. The concentrations of IL-1β, IL-6 and TNF-α were measured by Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) in AD cell model and serum from AD patients.Result:Serum miR-511-3p expression was decreased in AD patients and correlated with MMSE score, MoCA score and inflammatory response. MiR-511-3p mimics significantly reversed the effects of Aβ1-40on inflammation in AD cells. ROC curve results showed that miR-511-3p had high diagnostic accuracy in distinguishing normal controls from AD patients.Conclusion:Our results show that miR-511-3p is down-regulated in AD patients and has high diagnostic value. MiR-511-3p may participate in the development of AD by regulating the levels of neuroinflammatory factors in AD cells. MiR-511-3p may provide a new perspective for the prevention and pathogenesis of AD.",37121335,,10.1016/j.exger.2023.112195,0
Differential insular cortex sub-regional atrophy in neurodegenerative diseases: a systematic review and meta-analysis,"The insular cortex is proposed to function as a central brain hub characterized by wide-spread connections and diverse functional roles. As a result, its centrality in the brain confers high metabolic demands predisposing it to dysfunction in disease. However, the functional profile and vulnerability to degeneration varies across the insular sub-regions. The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis is to summarize and quantitatively analyze the relationship between insular cortex sub-regional atrophy, studied by voxel based morphometry, with cognitive and neuropsychiatric deficits in frontotemporal dementia (FTD), Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). We systematically searched through Pubmed and Embase and identified 519 studies that fit our criteria. A total of 41 studies (n = 2261 subjects) fulfilled the inclusion criteria for the meta-analysis. The peak insular coordinates were pooled and analyzed using Anatomic Likelihood Estimation. Our results showed greater left anterior insular cortex atrophy in FTD whereas the right anterior dorsal insular cortex showed larger clusters of atrophy in AD and PD/DLB. Yet contrast analyses did not reveal significant differences between disease groups. Functional analysis showed that left anterior insular cortex atrophy is associated with speech, emotion, and affective-cognitive deficits, and right dorsal atrophy with perception and cognitive deficits. In conclusion, insular sub-regional atrophy, particularly the anterior dorsal region, may contribute to cognitive and neuropsychiatric deficits in neurodegeneration. Our results support anterior insular cortex vulnerability and convey the differential involvement of the insular sub-regions in functional deficits in neurodegenerative diseases.",31011951,PMC7648006,10.1007/s11682-019-00099-3,21
A multi-task SCCA method for brain imaging genetics and its application in neurodegenerative diseases,"Background and objectives:In brain imaging genetics, multi-task sparse canonical correlation analysis (MTSCCA) is effective to study the bi-multivariate associations between genetic variations such as single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and multi-modal imaging quantitative traits (QTs). However, most existing MTSCCA methods are neither supervised nor capable of distinguishing the shared patterns of multi-modal imaging QTs from the specific patterns.Methods:A new diagnosis-guided MTSCCA (DDG-MTSCCA) with parameter decomposition and graph-guided pairwise group lasso penalty was proposed. Specifically, the multi-tasking modeling paradigm enables us to comprehensively identify risk genetic loci by jointly incorporating multi-modal imaging QTs. The regression sub-task was raised to guide the selection of diagnosis-related imaging QTs. To reveal the diverse genetic mechanisms, the parameter decomposition and different constraints were utilized to facilitate the identification of modality-consistent and -specific genotypic variations. Besides, a network constraint was added to find out meaningful brain networks. The proposed method was applied to synthetic data and two real neuroimaging data sets respectively from Alzheimer's disease neuroimaging initiative (ADNI) and Parkinson's progression marker initiative (PPMI) databases.Results:Compared with the competitive methods, the proposed method exhibited higher or comparable canonical correlation coefficients (CCCs) and better feature selection results. In particular, in the simulation study, DDG-MTSCCA showed the best anti-noise ability and achieved the highest average hit rate, about 25% higher than MTSCCA. On the real data of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD), our method obtained the highest average testing CCCs, about 40% ∼ 50% higher than MTSCCA. Especially, our method could select more comprehensive feature subsets, and the top five SNPs and imaging QTs were all disease-related. The ablation experimental results also demonstrated the significance of each component in the model, i.e., the diagnosis guidance, parameter decomposition, and network constraint.Conclusions:These results on simulated data, ADNI and PPMI cohorts suggested the effectiveness and generalizability of our method in identifying meaningful disease-related markers. DDG-MTSCCA could be a powerful tool in brain imaging genetics, worthy of in-depth study.",36905750,,10.1016/j.cmpb.2023.107450,0
"Investigating the Spatial Associations Between Amyloid-β Deposition, Grey Matter Volume, and Neuroinflammation in Alzheimer's Disease","Background:It has been proposed that amyloid-β (Aβ) plays a causal role in Alzheimer's disease (AD) by triggering a series of pathologic events-possibly including neuroinflammation-which culminate in progressive brain atrophy. However, the interplay between the two pathological molecular events and how both are associated with neurodegeneration is still unclear.Objective:We aimed to estimate the spatial inter-relationship between neurodegeneration, neuroinflammation and Aβ deposition in a cohort of 20 mild AD patients and 17 healthy controls (HC).Methods:We resorted to magnetic resonance imaging to measure cortical atrophy, using the radiotracer 11C-PK11195 PET to measure neuroinflammation levels and 11C-PiB PET to assess Aβ levels. Between-group comparisons were computed to explore AD-related changes in the three types of markers. To examine the effects of each one of the molecular pathologic mechanisms on neurodegeneration we computed: 1) ANCOVAs with the anatomic data, controlling for radiotracer uptake differences between groups and 2) voxel-based multiple regression analysis between-modalities. In addition, associations in anatomically defined regions of interests were also investigated.Results:We found significant differences between AD and controls in the levels of atrophy, neuroinflammation, and Aβ deposition. Associations between Aβ aggregation and brain atrophy were detected in AD in a widely distributed pattern, whereas associations between microglia activation and structural measures of neurodegeneration were restricted to few anatomically regions.Conclusion:In summary, Aβ deposition, as opposed to neuroinflammation, was more associated with cortical atrophy, suggesting a prominent role of Aβ in neurodegeneration at a mild stage of the AD.",33523050,PMC8075404,10.3233/JAD-200840,6
Integrated Bioinformatics Analysis to Identify Alternative Therapeutic Targets for Alzheimer's Disease: Insights from a Synaptic Machinery Perspective,"Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common type of dementia, is a serious neurodegenerative disease that has no cure yet, but whose symptoms can be alleviated with available medications. Therefore, early and accurate diagnosis of the disease and elucidation of the molecular mechanisms involved in the progression of pathogenesis are critically important. This study aimed to identify dysregulated miRNAs and their target mRNAs through the integrated analysis of miRNA and mRNA expression profiling in AD patients versus unaffected controls. Expression profiles in postmortem brain samples from AD patients and healthy individuals were extracted from the Gene Expression Omnibus database and were analyzed using bioinformatics approaches to identify gene ontologies, pathways, and networks. Finally, the module analysis of the PPI network and hub gene selection was carried out. A total of five differentially expressed miRNAs were extracted from the miRNA dataset, and 4312 differentially expressed mRNAs were obtained from the mRNA dataset. By comparing the DEGs and the putative targets of the altered miRNAs, 116 (3 upregulated and 113 downregulated) coordinated genes were determined. Also, six hub genes (SNAP25, GRIN2A, GRIN2B, DLG2, ATP2B2, and SCN2A) were identified by constructing a PPI network. The results of the present study provide insight into mechanisms such as synaptic machinery and neuronal communication underlying AD pathogenesis, specifically concerning miRNAs.",34414562,,10.1007/s12031-021-01893-9,11
Genetic model of selective COX2 inhibition improve learning and memory ability and brain pathological changes in 5xFAD mouse,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disease that leads to dementia. Its pathogenesis is very complex, and inflammation is one of the main pathophysiological mechanisms of AD. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), which mainly target cyclooxygenase (COX) activity, are used to reduce the risk of AD, but several side effects limit their application. Here we assess the effect of Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX2) catalytic activity on learning ability and AD pathology using 5x Familial Alzheimer's Disease (FAD) mice with COX2 inhibition (5xFAD/COX2 KO), 5xFAD mice with cyclooxygenase inactivation of COX2 (5xFAD/COX2 Y385F), and 5xFAD mice with peroxidase (POX) inactivation of COX2 (5xFAD/COX2) H374Y), respectively. Our results indicate that learning ability of COX2 KO and mutants is improved compared to 5xFAD mice, further investigations show that Aβ depositions are reduced, microglia and astrocytes homeostasis are changed in COX2 KO and mutants. Especially, there is more responsive microglia in the brain of 5xFAD/COX2 Y385F mice, and Aβ depositions are more effectively cleaned at old age. Taken together, these results identify a role of COX2 Y385F in regulating microglia function and may have important implications for future treatment of AD.",37683778,,10.1016/j.brainres.2023.148566,0
Brain regions show different metabolic and protein arginine methylation phenotypes in frontotemporal dementias and Alzheimer's disease,"Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is a heterogeneous neurodegenerative disease with multiple histopathological subtypes. FTD patients share similar symptoms with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Hence, FTD patients are commonly misdiagnosed as AD, despite the consensus clinical diagnostic criteria. It is therefore of great clinical need to identify a biomarker that can distinguish FTD from AD and control individuals, and potentially further differentiate between FTD pathological subtypes. We conducted a metabolomic analysis on post-mortem human brain tissue from three regions: cerebellum, frontal cortex and occipital cortex from control, FTLD-TDP type A, type A-C9, type C and AD. Our results indicate that the brain subdivisions responsible for different functions show different metabolic patterns. We further explored the region-specific metabolic characteristics of different FTD subtypes and AD patients. Different FTD subtypes and AD share similar metabolic phenotypes in the cerebellum, but AD exhibited distinct metabolic patterns in the frontal and occipital regions compared to FTD. The identified brain region-specific metabolite biomarkers could provide a tool for distinguishing different FTD subtypes and AD and provide the first insights into the metabolic changes of FTLD-TDP type A, type A-C9, type C and AD in different regions of the brain. The importance of protein arginine methylation in neurodegenerative disease has come to light, so we investigated whether the arginine methylation level contributes to disease pathogenesis. Our findings provide new insights into the relationship between arginine methylation and metabolic changes in FTD subtypes and AD that could be further explored, to study the molecular mechanism of pathogenesis.",36581185,,10.1016/j.pneurobio.2022.102400,2
[Development of peptide binder design method for disease-related phase separation proteins],"Neurodegenerative diseases such as dementia and Alzheimer's disease are caused by liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) proteins. LLPS is a phenomenon in which a dense liquid phase of proteins is formed in a liquid phase in which proteins are dispersed at a low concentration. The concentrated proteins enable highly efficient chemical reactions, but at the same time, there is a risk of forming insoluble aggregates that cause diseases. In fact, neurodegenerative disease-related proteins form insoluble aggregates, which cause great damage to nerves, resulting in memory and motor disorders. Drug discovery requires the design of drug candidates that can strongly bind to the intrinsically disordered region of a phase-separated protein and control the phase-separated state. This paper mainly introduces our research on peptide design that binds to phase-separated proteins. For peptide drug discovery, it is necessary to efficiently search for drug candidates among a huge number of peptides. As an efficient search method for peptides that control phase-separated proteins, we searched for amino acids that can control liquid-liquid phase separation, and devised a method for designing peptides containing effective amino acids. It was demonstrated that this method can be used to control the LLPS and solid aggregate formation of the neurodegenerative disease-related protein FUS. Furthermore, we devised a method for rationally designing a peptide that binds complementarily to the intrinsically disordered region of the target, and demonstrated the functional control of the cancer disease-related protein p53. Finally, we discuss the possibility of peptide drug discovery for disease-related LLPS proteins.",36328544,,10.1254/fpj.22016,0
Design and synthesis of astatinated benzothiazole compounds for their potential use in Targeted Alpha Therapy (TAT) strategies to treat Alzheimer's disease-associated amyloid plaques,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a terminal neurodegenerative disease characterized by the buildup of amyloid fibrils, amorphous aggregates and tauopathies. Several treatment modalities, which rely on various biological processes to reduce disease burden, have been largely ineffective at treating Alzheimer's disease. Targeted alpha therapy (TAT) has demonstrated positive results in the treatment of cancer. Benzothiazole derivatives have been successfully shown to target these plaques and are used in several imaging applications. One such derivative, Flutemetamol (VizamylTM) is an FDA approved diagnostic tool for PET imaging of AD-associated plaques. We report the radiolabeling of benzothiazole derivatives with211At, a 7.2 h alpha emitting radionuclide, using a copper catalyzed reaction with a boronic acid precursor molecule.

Ferroptotic Potency of ISM1 Expression in the Drug-Induced Alzheimer's Disease-Like Phenotype Under the Influence of Betulin,"Background:Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease characterized by two main pathological mechanisms, mostly hyperphosphorylated tau and amyloid-β toxicity. Although many studies focus on these basic mechanisms, ferroptosis draws attention as an important pathway responsible for neurodegeneration in AD. There is no definitive treatment for AD but alternative phytochemicals to drugs come into prominence. Betulin is usually obtained from the birch tree. It is an abundant triterpene and has a high antioxidant capacity. Isthmin-1 (ISM1) is a secreted adipokine.Objective:In this study, we investigated the potential treatment of AD in the ferroptosis-ISM1-betulin triangle.Methods:For this, we created an AD model with okadaic acid (200 ng/kg)) in 36 Wistar albino male rats and treated with betulin (20 mg/kg/day, i.p). We evaluated ISM1 gene expression, iron accumulation, and total oxidative metabolism parameters (TAS, TOS, OSI) in hippocampal tissue. We analyzed cognitive recovery in AD with Morris Water Maze Test and general locomotor activity, explore, and anti-anxiolytic effect with Open Field Test.Results:We compared the obtained data with metabolic and genetic results. In conclusion, betulin may have a role in neuronal ferroptotic mechanisms by reducing iron accumulation by ISM1 regulation.Conclusions:Betulin may have a role in neuronal ferroptotic mechanisms by reducing iron accumulation by ISM1 regulation. Although this study suggests the corrective effect of betulin and ISM1 on cognitive gain and anxiety, it is the first study to show the total antioxidant capacity of betulin in AD.",37980676,,10.3233/JAD-230940,0
Automated age- and sex-specific volumetric estimation of regional brain atrophy: workflow and feasibility,"Objectives:An automated workflow for age- and sex-specific estimation of regional brain volume changes from structural MRI relative to a standard population is presented and evaluated for feasibility.Methods:T1w MRI scans are preprocessed in a standardized way comprising gray matter (GM) segmentation, normalization, modulation, and spatial smoothing. Resulting GM images are then compared to precomputed age- and sex-specific GM templates derived from the population-based Nathan Kline Institute Rockland Sample, and voxel-wise z-maps are compiled. z-maps are color-coded and fused with the subject's T1w images. The rate of technical success of the proposed workflow was evaluated in 1330 subjects of the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). Furthermore, medial temporal atrophy (MTA) was assessed using the color-coded maps and with the MTA visual rating scale in these subjects. Sensitivities and specificity of color-coded maps and MTA scale were compared using McNemar's test.Results:One test dataset was excluded due to severe motion artifacts. Out of the remaining 1329 datasets, atrophy map generation was successful in 1323 ADNI subjects (99.5%). Sensitivity for AD diagnosis (71.4 % vs. 53.3%, p < 0.0001 for left; 70.4% vs. 55.3%, p < 0.0001 for right hemisphere) and for MCI (45.4% vs. 17.4, p < 0.0001 for left; 43.5% vs. 14.6%, p < 0.0001 for right hemisphere) based on medial temporal atrophy assessment in color-coded maps was significantly higher than for MTA visual rating scale, while specificity was lower (78.4% vs. 93.8%, p < 0.0001 for left; 79.4% vs. 95.8%, p < 0.0001 for right hemisphere). The workflow is named veganbagel and is published as open-source software with an integrated PACS interface.Conclusions:Automated brain volume change estimation with the proposed workflow is feasible and technically dependable. It provides high potential for radiologic assessment of brain volume changes and neurodegenerative diseases.Key points:• A workflow combining techniques from voxel-based morphometry and population-based neuroimaging data is feasible and technically highly dependable. • The workflow is provided as open-source software, named veganbagel. • Sensitivity of medial temporal atrophy assessment in atrophy maps from veganbagel exceeds the sensitivity of MTA visual rating scale for the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease.",32852588,PMC7813701,10.1007/s00330-020-07196-8,10
"Interrelations of Alzheimer´s disease candidate biomarkers neurogranin, fatty acid-binding protein 3 and ferritin to neurodegeneration and neuroinflammation","There is growing evidence that promising biomarkers of inflammation in Alzheimer´s disease (AD) and other neurodegenerative diseases correlate strongest to levels of tau or neurofilament, indicating an inflammatory response to neuronal damage or death. To test this hypothesis, we investigated three AD candidate markers (ferritin, fatty acid binding protein 3 (FABP-3), and neurogranin) in interrelation to established AD and inflammatory protein markers. We further aimed to determine if such interrelations would be evident in pathological subjects only or also under non-pathological circumstances. Cerebrospinal fluid levels of the three proteins were quantified in samples from the University Clinic of Bonn (UKB) Department of Neurodegenerative Diseases & Geriatric Psychiatry, Germany. Data were analyzed based on clinical or biomarker-defined stratification of subjects with adjustment for covariates age, sex, and APOE status. Levels of ferritin, FABP-3 and neurogranin were elevated in subjects with pathological levels of t-tau independent of beta-amyloid status. The three markers correlated with each other, tau isoforms, age, and those inflammatory markers previously described as related to neurodegeneration, predominantly sTREM2, macrophage migration inhibitory factor, soluble vascular endothelial growth factor receptor, soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (sVCAM-1), and C1q. These interrelations existed in subjects with pathological and sub-pathological tau levels, in particular for FABP-3 and neurogranin. Relations to ferritin were independent of absolute levels of tau, too, but showed differing trajectories between pathological and non-pathological subjects. A specific set of inflammatory markers is highly related to markers of neuronal damage such as tau, neurogranin, or FABP-3. These proteins could be used as readouts of the inflammatory response during the neurodegeneration phase of AD.",32894885,,10.1111/jnc.15175,10
The Use of Data Collection and Big Data Analysis in Neurodegenerative Disease Prevention,"Data collection and analysis is becoming more and more important in our everyday lives. It is widely believed that with the power of data collection, almost every problem can be given a possible solution. Machine learning and artificial intelligence algorithms along with the use of the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database that collects data from subjects suffering from Alzheimer's disease (AD) can be utilised for recognising biomarkers' patterns that suggest degenerative behavior. Thus, allowing for early prevention. Computers are able to distinguish patterns over millions of data faster than humans can. The suggested methodology will be able to precisely find subjects that might suffer from such diseases due to certain patterns and biomarkers that suggest such predisposition at an early and thus treatable stage of the disease. Due to the quantity of the data collected, an algorithm will be able to distinguish even the slightest change in a healthy neuron in order to treat it. Other databases can be used for other diseases without the concept being changed.",34973023,,10.1007/978-3-030-78775-2_21,0
The regulatory role of non-coding RNAs and their interactions with phytochemicals in neurodegenerative diseases: a systematic review,"Neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs) are on the rise in the world. Therefore, it is a critical issue to reveal the precise pathophysiological mechanisms and novel therapeutic strategies to deal with such conditions. Passing through different mechanisms, non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) play a pivotal role in NDDs through various mechanisms, by changing the expression of some genes, interference with protein translation and alterations in some signaling pathways. It urges the need to introduce novel strategies and therapeutic agents with multi-targeting potentials. Phytochemicals are hopeful antioxidants and anti-inflammatory agents with promising modulatory roles on dysregulated signaling pathways and protein translation during NDDs. In this study, the role of ncRNAs (e.g. lncRNAs, miRNA, siRNAs and piRNAs) was highlighted in NDDs. This study also aimed to investigate the role of phytochemicals (phenolic compounds, alkaloids, terpenoids and sulfur compounds) in the modulation of ncRNAs during NDDs such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, epilepsy, depression and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.",36722043,,10.1093/bfgp/elac055,2
Antibody recognizing 4-sulfated chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans restores memory in tauopathy-induced neurodegeneration,"Chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (CSPGs) are the main active component of perineuronal nets (PNNs). Digestion of the glycosaminoglycan chains of CSPGs with chondroitinase ABC or transgenic attenuation of PNNs leads to prolongation of object recognition memory and activation of various forms of plasticity in the adult central nervous system. The inhibitory properties of the CSPGs depend on the pattern of sulfation of their glycosaminoglycans, with chondroitin 4-sulfate (C4S) being the most inhibitory form. In this study, we tested a number of candidates for functional blocking of C4S, leading to selection of an antibody, Cat316, which specifically recognizes C4S and blocks its inhibitory effects on axon growth. It also partly blocks binding of semaphorin 3A to PNNs and attenuates PNN formation. We asked whether injection of Cat316 into the perirhinal cortex would have the same effects on memory as chondroitinase ABC treatment. We found that masking C4S with the Cat316 antibody extended long-term object recognition memory in normal wild-type mice to 24 hours, similarly to chondroitinase or transgenic PNN attenuation. We then tested Cat316 for restoration of memory in a neurodegeneration model. Mice expressing tau with the P301S mutation showed profound loss of object recognition memory at 4 months of age. Injection of Cat316 into the perirhinal cortex normalized object recognition at 3 hours in P301S mice. These data indicate that Cat316 binding to C4S in the extracellular matrix can restore plasticity and memory in the same way as chondroitinase ABC digestion. Our results suggest that antibodies to C4S could be a useful therapeutic to restore memory function in neurodegenerative disorders.",28890301,,10.1016/j.neurobiolaging.2017.08.002,33
Gene Expression Profiling as a Novel Diagnostic Tool for Neurodegenerative Disorders,"There is a lack of effective diagnostic biomarkers for neurodegenerative disorders (NDDs). Here, we established gene expression profiles for diagnosing Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), and vascular (VaD)/mixed dementia. Patients with AD had decreased APOE, PSEN1, and ABCA7 mRNA expression. Subjects with VaD/mixed dementia had 98% higher PICALM mRNA levels, but 75% lower ABCA7 mRNA expression than healthy individuals. Patients with PD and PD-related disorders showed increased SNCA mRNA levels. There were no differences in mRNA expression for OPRK1, NTRK2, and LRRK2 between healthy subjects and NDD patients. APOE mRNA expression had high diagnostic accuracy for AD, and moderate accuracy for PD and VaD/mixed dementia. PSEN1 mRNA expression showed promising accuracy for AD. PICALM mRNA expression was less accurate as a biomarker for AD. ABCA7 and SNCA mRNA expression showed high-to-excellent diagnostic accuracy for AD and PD, and moderate-to-high accuracy for VaD/mixed dementia. The APOE E4 allele reduced APOE expression in patients with different APOE genotypes. There was no association between PSEN1, PICALM, ABCA7, and SNCA gene polymorphisms and expression. Our study suggests that gene expression analysis has diagnostic value for NDDs and provides a liquid biopsy alternative to current diagnostic methods.",36982820,PMC10057696,10.3390/ijms24065746,2
Pronounced impairment of everyday skills and self-care in posterior cortical atrophy,"Posterior cortical atrophy (PCA) is a neurodegenerative syndrome characterized by progressive visual dysfunction and parietal, occipital, and occipitotemporal atrophy. The aim of this study was to compare the impact of PCA and typical Alzheimer's disease (tAD) on everyday functional abilities and neuropsychiatric status. The Cambridge Behavioural Inventory-Revised was given to carers of 32 PCA and 71 tAD patients. PCA patients showed significantly greater impairment in everyday skills and self-care while the tAD group showed greater impairment in aspects of memory and orientation, and motivation. We suggest that PCA poses specific challenges for those caring for people affected by the condition.",25096622,,10.3233/JAD-141071,12
An Alternative Approach to Study Primary Events in Neurodegeneration Using Ex Vivo Rat Brain Slices,"Despite numerous studies that attempt to develop reliable animal models which reflecting the primary processes underlying neurodegeneration, very few have been widely accepted. Here, we propose a new procedure adapted from the well-known ex vivo brain slice technique, which offers a closer in vivo-like scenario than in vitro preparations, for investigating the early events triggering cell degeneration, as observed in Alzheimer's disease (AD). This variation consists of simple and easily reproducible steps, which enable preservation of the anatomical cytoarchitecture of the selected brain region and its local functionality in a physiological milieu. Different anatomical areas can be obtained from the same brain, providing the opportunity to perform multiple experiments with the treatments in question in a site-, dose-, and time-dependent manner. Potential limitations which could affect the outcomes related to this methodology are related to the conservation of the tissue, i.e., the maintenance of its anatomical integrity during the slicing and incubation steps and the section thickness, which can influence the biochemical and immunohistochemical analysis. This approach can be employed for different purposes, such as exploring molecular mechanisms involved in physiological or pathological conditions, drug screening, or dose-response assays. Finally, this protocol could also reduce the number of animals employed in behavioral studies. The application reported here has been recently described and tested for the first time on ex vivo rat brain slices containing the basal forebrain (BF), which is one of the cerebral regions primarily affected in AD. Specifically, it has been demonstrated that the administration of a toxic peptide derived from the C-terminus of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) could prompt an AD-like profile, triggering, along the antero-posterior axis of the BF, a differential expression of proteins altered in AD, such as the alpha7 nicotinic receptor (α7-nAChR), phosphorylated Tau (p-Tau), and amyloid beta (Aβ).",29708553,PMC5933479,10.3791/57507,4
[Multifunctional ligands--a new approach in the search for drugs against multi-factorial diseases],"Selective drugs directed at a single biological target often prove ineffective in the treatment of diseases with a complex pathomechanism, e.g. Alzheimer's disease (AD). This situation prompts researchers to design multi-target-directed ligands (MTDLs), capable of interacting with a number of selected biological targets. The paper outlines the concept of the multi-target-directed ligand design and examples of its use in the search of a cure for AD. In the knowledge-based approach for designing MTDLs, selective ligands of different targets are combined in one molecule. In the screening-based approach, libraries of compounds are screened against selected targets, which allows one to find molecules with a desirable pharmacological profile. It is also possible to obtain multifunctional ligands by performing optimization of a drug with known side activity and transforming it into the main activity, with a simultaneous decrease or complete removal of the original activity. The type of biological targets and applied MTDL design strategy affect the physicochemical and pharmacokinetic properties of the resulting molecules. AD is a multifactorial neurodegenerative disease of the central nervous system associated with the formation of neurofibrillary tangles within neurons, formed by the hyperphosphorylated τ proteins, and extracellular β-amyloid deposits (senile plaques). Current AD therapy comprises symptomatic drugs that enhance cholinergic neurotransmission or inhibit glutamate receptors. The literature provides numerous examples of compounds which proved in in vitro tests to be multifunctional ligands. Most of them are derivatives of cholinesterase-inhibiting drugs, also capable of inhibiting the aggregation of Aβ and showing neuroprotective effects in Aβ-induced cytotoxicity assays.",27259214,,,4
Neuronal activity induces symmetry breaking in neurodegenerative disease spreading,"Dynamical systems on networks typically involve several dynamical processes evolving at different timescales. For instance, in Alzheimer's disease, the spread of toxic protein throughout the brain not only disrupts neuronal activity but is also influenced by neuronal activity itself, establishing a feedback loop between the fast neuronal activity and the slow protein spreading. Motivated by the case of Alzheimer's disease, we study the multiple-timescale dynamics of a heterodimer spreading process on an adaptive network of Kuramoto oscillators. Using a minimal two-node model, we establish that heterogeneous oscillatory activity facilitates toxic outbreaks and induces symmetry breaking in the spreading patterns. We then extend the model formulation to larger networks and perform numerical simulations of the slow-fast dynamics on common network motifs and on the brain connectome. The simulations corroborate the findings from the minimal model, underscoring the significance of multiple-timescale dynamics in the modeling of neurodegenerative diseases.",38740613,,10.1007/s00285-024-02103-x,0
Disruption of a RAC1-centred network is associated with Alzheimer's disease pathology and causes age-dependent neurodegeneration,"The molecular biological mechanisms of Alzheimer's disease (AD) involve disease-associated crosstalk through many genes and include a loss of normal as well as a gain of abnormal interactions among genes. A protein domain network (PDN) is a collection of physical bindings that occur between protein domains, and the states of the PDNs in patients with AD are likely to be perturbed compared to those in normal healthy individuals. To identify PDN changes that cause neurodegeneration, we analysed the PDNs that occur among genes co-expressed in each of three brain regions at each stage of AD. Our analysis revealed that the PDNs collapsed with the progression of AD stage and identified five hub genes, including Rac1, as key players in PDN collapse. Using publicly available as well as our own gene expression data, we confirmed that the mRNA expression level of the RAC1 gene was downregulated in the entorhinal cortex (EC) of AD brains. To test the causality of these changes in neurodegeneration, we utilized Drosophila as a genetic model and found that modest knockdown of Rac1 in neurons was sufficient to cause age-dependent behavioural deficits and neurodegeneration. Finally, we identified a microRNA, hsa-miR-101-3p, as a potential regulator of RAC1 in AD brains. As the Braak neurofibrillary tangle (NFT) stage progressed, the expression levels of hsa-miR-101-3p were increased specifically in the EC. Furthermore, overexpression of hsa-miR-101-3p in the human neuronal cell line SH-SY5Y caused RAC1 downregulation. These results highlight the utility of our integrated network approach for identifying causal changes leading to neurodegeneration in AD.",31942999,PMC7191305,10.1093/hmg/ddz320,18
Cerebrospinal Fluid Level of Aquaporin4: A New Window on Glymphatic System Involvement in Neurodegenerative Disease?,"Aquaporin4 (AQP4) is a water channel protein located at astrocyte foot processes that plays a role in glymphatic system, a highly organized fluid transport pathway which seems to be involved in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH) pathophysiology. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) AQP4 levels were determined in 11 patients with AD, 10 patients with NPH, and 9 controls. We found significantly reduced AQP4 in AD patients, a trend in reduction in NPH patients, and a correlation between AQP4 and amyloid-β CSF levels. This study indicates the potential role of AQP4 and glymphatic system in neurodegenerative diseases pathophysiology.",31156164,,10.3233/JAD-190119,15
"Classic Prescription, Kai-Xin-San, Ameliorates Alzheimer's Disease as an Effective Multitarget Treatment: From Neurotransmitter to Protein Signaling Pathway","Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a widespread neurodegenerative disease caused by complicated disease-causing factors. Unsatisfactorily, curative effects of approved anti-AD drugs were not good enough due to their actions on single-target, which led to desperate requirements for more effective drug therapies involved in multiple pathomechanisms of AD. The anti-AD effect with multiple action targets of Kai-Xin-San (KXS), a classic prescription initially recorded inBei Ji Qian Jin Yao Fangand applied in the treatment of dementia for thousands of years, was deciphered with modern biological methods in our study. Aβ25-35and D-gal-induced AD rats and Aβ25-35-induced PC12 cells were applied to establish AD models. KXS could significantly improve cognition impairment by decreasing neurotransmitter loss and enhancing the expression of PI3K/Akt. For the first time, KXS was confirmed to improve the expression of PI3K/Akt by neurotransmitter 5-HT. Thereinto, PI3K/Akt could further inhibit Tau hyperphosphorylation as well as the apoptosis induced by oxidative stress and neuroinflammation. Moreover, all above-mentioned effects were verified and blocked by PI3K inhibitor, LY294002, in Aβ25-35-induced PC12 cells, suggesting the precise regulative role of KXS in the PI3K/Akt pathway. The utilization and mechanism elaboration of KXS have been proposed and dissected in the combination of animal, molecular, and protein strategies. Our results demonstrated that KXS could ameliorate AD by regulating neurotransmitter and PI3K/Akt signal pathway as an effective multitarget treatment so that the potential value of this classic prescription could be explored from a novel perspective.",31354916,PMC6636599,10.1155/2019/9096409,13
Capillary dysfunction is associated with symptom severity and neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's disease,"Introduction:We examined whether cortical microvascular blood volume and hemodynamics in Alzheimer's disease (AD) are consistent with tissue hypoxia and whether they correlate with cognitive performance and the degree of cortical thinning.Methods:Thirty-two AD patients underwent cognitive testing, structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and perfusion MRI at baseline and after 6 months. We measured cortical thickness, microvascular cerebral blood volume (CBV), cerebral blood flow (CBF), mean transit time (MTT), and capillary transit time heterogeneity (CTH) and estimated tissue oxygen tension (PtO2).Results:At baseline, poor cognitive performance and regional cortical thinning correlated with lower CBF and CBV, with higher MTT and CTH and with low PtO2across the cortex. Cognitive decline over time was associated with increasing whole brain relative transit time heterogeneity (RTH = CTH/MTT).Discussion:Our results confirm the importance of microvascular pathology in AD. Deteriorating microvascular hemodynamics may cause hypoxia, which is known to precipitate amyloid retention.",28343848,,10.1016/j.jalz.2017.02.007,48
A roadmap for investigating the role of the prion protein in depression associated with neurodegenerative disease,"The physiological properties of the native, endogenous prion protein (PrP(C)) is a matter of concern, due to its pleiotropic functions and links to neurodegenerative disorders and cancer. In line with our hypothesis that the basic function of PrP(C) is to serve as a cell surface scaffold for the assembly of signaling modules, multiple interactions have been identified of PrP(C) with signaling molecules, including neurotransmitter receptors. We recently reported evidence that PrP(C) may modulate monoaminergic neurotransmission, as well as depressive-like behavior in mice. Here, we discuss how those results, together with a number of other studies, including our previous demonstration that both inflammatory and behavioral stress modulate PrP(C) content in neutrophils, suggest a distributed role of PrP(C) in clinical depression and inflammation associated with neurodegenerative diseases. An overarching understanding of the multiple interventions of PrP(C) upon physiological events may both shed light on the pathogenesis of, as well as help the identification of novel therapeutic targets for clinical depression, Prion and Alzheimer's Diseases.",27057694,PMC4981214,10.1080/19336896.2016.1152437,2
How to Assess Executive Functions in a Low-Educated and Multicultural Population Using a Switching Verbal Fluency Test (the TFA-93) in Neurodegenerative Diseases?,"Few neuropsychological tests are available to assess executive dysfunction in low-educated and multicultural populations. To address this issue, the TFA-93, a switching verbal fluency test to assess cognitive flexibility, was administered to 70 healthy controls, 57 patients with a clinical diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease, and 21 with a clinical diagnosis of a neurodegenerative disease associated with frontal disorders. Most of the participants were low-educated and nonnative French speakers. The TFA-93 comprises 2 categorical fluency tasks (animals and fruits) and a fluency task in which participants have to switch between animals and fruits. Correct responses and errors were collected, and a flexibility index expressed the switching cost. Results showed that correct responses were lower, and the switching cost was greater in both patient groups. In low-educated and multicultural populations, the TFA-93 seems to be a good alternative to assess flexibility compared to the standard neuropsychological tools based on academic abilities.",30827122,PMC10653371,10.1177/1533317519833844,4
"Microtubule-Stabilizing 1,2,4-Triazolo[1,5-a]pyrimidines as Candidate Therapeutics for Neurodegenerative Disease: Matched Molecular Pair Analyses and Computational Studies Reveal New Structure-Activity Insights","Microtubule (MT)-stabilizing 1,2,4-triazolo[1,5-a]pyrimidines (TPDs) hold promise as candidate therapeutics for Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other neurodegenerative conditions. However, depending on the choice of substituents around the TPD core, these compounds can elicit markedly different cellular phenotypes that likely arise from the interaction of TPD congeners with either one or two spatially distinct binding sites within tubulin heterodimers (i.e., the seventh site and the vinca site). In the present study, we report the design, synthesis, and evaluation of a series of new TPD congeners, as well as matched molecular pair analyses and computational studies, that further elucidate the structure-activity relationships of MT-active TPDs. These studies led to the identification of novel MT-normalizing TPD candidates that exhibit favorable ADME-PK, including brain penetration and oral bioavailability, as well as brain pharmacodynamic activity.",36534051,PMC9841533,10.1021/acs.jmedchem.2c01411,5
Identification of changes in neuronal function as a consequence of aging and tauopathic neurodegeneration using a novel and sensitive magnetic resonance imaging approach,"Tauopathies, the most common of which is Alzheimer's disease (AD), constitute the most crippling neurodegenerative threat to our aging population. Tauopathic patients have significant cognitive decline accompanied by irreversible and severe brain atrophy, and it is thought that neuronal dysfunction begins years before diagnosis. Our current understanding of tauopathies has yielded promising therapeutic interventions but have all failed in clinical trials. This is partly due to the inability to identify and intervene in an effective therapeutic window early in the disease process. A major challenge that contributes to the definition of an early therapeutic window is limited technologies. To address these challenges, we modified and adapted a manganese-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MEMRI) approach to provide sensitive and quantitative power to detect changes in broad neuronal function in aging mice. Considering that tau tangle burden correlates well with cognitive impairment in Alzheimer's patients, we performed our MEMRI approach in a time course of aging mice and an accelerated mouse model of tauopathy. We measured significant changes in broad neuronal function as a consequence of age, and in transgenic mice, before the deposition of bona fide tangles. This MEMRI approach represents the first diagnostic measure of neuronal dysfunction in mice. Successful translation of this technology in the clinic could serve as a sensitive diagnostic tool for the definition of effective therapeutic windows.",28500878,PMC5524451,10.1016/j.neurobiolaging.2017.04.007,17
Is Cerebrospinal Fluid Superoxide Dismutase 1 a Biomarker of Tau But Not Amyloid-Induced Neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's Disease?,"Copper/zinc superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) scavenges free radicals that may otherwise damage brain parenchyma. Impaired SOD1 activity drives Alzheimer's disease (AD) neuropathology in animal models and postmortem AD brains. Yet, it is unknown how cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) SOD1 is relatedin vivoto AD-relevant cognitive, neuroimaging, and CSF neurotoxic factors, and what potential mechanisms underlie these associations. We found that higher CSF SOD1 correlated with better global cognition scores, yet less gray matter (GM) and glucose metabolism in AD-sensitive parietal and frontal regions. Higher CSF SOD1 was also associated with more CSF total tau and phosphorylated tau-181, but not beta-amyloid 1-42. Through mediation analyses, higher total tau largely mitigated higher CSF SOD1 and better global cognition associations, and it fully accounted for less predicted regional GM but not glucose metabolism. Among participants who developed AD over 2 years or had AD at baseline, higher CSF SOD1 was initially related to more regional GM. This association became nonsignificant with full mediationviahigher CSF total tau, through which higher CSF SOD1 predicted more total tau and in turn less GM. Our observations lead to the hypothesis that SOD1 antioxidation reflects tau but not amyloid accumulation, which may lead to pro-oxidant-based neurodegeneration and cognitive dysfunction.Antioxid.

Cdk5 increases MARK4 activity and augments pathological tau accumulation and toxicity through tau phosphorylation at Ser262,"Hyperphosphorylation of the microtubule-associated protein tau is associated with many neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease. Microtubule affinity-regulating kinases (MARK) 1-4 and cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5) are tau kinases under physiological and pathological conditions. However, their functional relationship remains elusive. Here, we report a novel mechanism by which Cdk5 activates MARK4 and augments tau phosphorylation, accumulation and toxicity. MARK4 is highly phosphorylated at multiple sites in the brain and in cultured neurons, and inhibition of Cdk5 activity reduces phosphorylation levels of MARK4. MARK4 is known to be activated by phosphorylation at its activation loop by liver kinase B1 (LKB1). In contrast, Cdk5 increased phosphorylation of MARK4 in the spacer domain, but not in the activation loop, and enhanced its kinase activity, suggesting a novel mechanism by which Cdk5 regulates MARK4 activity. We also demonstrated that co-expression of Cdk5 and MARK4 in mammalian cultured cells significantly increased the levels of tau phosphorylation at both Cdk5 target sites (SP/TP sites) and MARK target sites (Ser262), as well as the levels of total tau. Furthermore, using a Drosophila model of tau toxicity, we demonstrated that Cdk5 promoted tau accumulation and tau-induced neurodegeneration via increasing tau phosphorylation levels at Ser262 by a fly ortholog of MARK, Par-1. This study suggests a novel mechanism by which Cdk5 and MARK4 synergistically increase tau phosphorylation and accumulation, consequently promoting neurodegeneration in disease pathogenesis.",31174206,,10.1093/hmg/ddz120,17
A new age-related cutoff of medial temporal atrophy scale on MRI improving the diagnostic accuracy of neurodegeneration due to Alzheimer's disease in a Chinese population,"Background:Visual rating scales are still the most popular tools in assessing atrophy degrees of whole brain and lobes. However, the false negative rate of the previous cutoff score of visual rating scales was relatively high for detecting dementia of Alzheimer's type (DAT). This study aimed to evaluate the diagnostic value of new cutoffs of visual rating scales on magnetic resonance imaging for discriminating DAT in a Chinese population.Methods:Out of 585 enrolled subjects, 296 participants were included and diagnosed as normal cognition (NC)(n = 87), 138 diagnosed as amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI), and 71 as dementia of Alzheimer's type (DAT). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analyses were used to calculate the diagnostic value of visual rating sales (including medial temporal atrophy (MTA), posterior atrophy rating scale (PA),global cortical atrophy scale (GCA) and medial temporal-lobe atrophy index (MTAi))for detecting NC from DAT .Results:Scores of MTA correlated to age and Mini-mental state examination score. When used to detect DAT from NC, the MTA showed highest diagnostic value than other scales, and when the cutoff score of 1.5 of MTA scale, it obtained an optimal sensitivity (84.5%) and specificity (79.1%) respectively, with a 15.5% of false negative rate. Cutoff scores and diagnostic values were calculated stratified by age. For the age ranges 50-64, 65-74, 75-84 years, the following cut-offs of MTA should be used, ≥1.0(sensitivity and specificity were 92.3 and 68.4%), ≥1.5(sensitivity and specificity were 90.4 and 85.2%), ≥ 2.0(sensitivity and specificity were 70.8 and 82.3%) respectively. All of the scales showed relatively lower diagnostic values for discriminating aMCI from NC.Conclusions:The new age-based MTA cutoff showed better diagnostic accuracy for detecting DAT than previous standard, the list of practical cut-offs proposed here might be useful in clinical practice.",30819102,PMC6394092,10.1186/s12877-019-1072-8,13
Effects of Exercise Training on Immune-Related Genes and Pathways in the Cortex of Animal Models of Alzheimer's Disease: A Systematic Review,"Background:Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a chronic neurodegenerative disease that affects the immune system due to the accumulation of amyloid-β (Aβ) and tau associated molecular pathology and other pathogenic processes. To address AD pathogenesis, various approaches had been conducted from drug development to lifestyle modification to reduce the prevalence of AD. Exercise is considered a prominent lifestyle modification to combat AD.Objective:This observation prompted us to review the literature on exercise related to immune genes in the cortex of animal models of AD. We focused on animal model studies due to their prevalence in this domain.Methods:The systematic review was conducted according to PRISMA standards using Web of Science (WoS) and PubMed databases. Any kind of genes, proteins, and molecular molecules were included in this systematic review. The list of these immune-related molecules was analyzed in the STRING database for functional enrichment analysis.Results:We found that 17 research studies discussed immune-related molecules and 30 immune proteins. These studies showed that exercise had the ability to ameliorate dysfunction in AD-related pathways, which led to decreasing the expression of microglia-related pathways and Th17-related immune pathways. As a result of decreasing the expression of immune-related pathways, the expression of apoptosis-related pathways was also decreasing, and neuronal survival was increased by exercise activity.Conclusions:Based on functional enrichment analysis, exercise not only could reduce apoptotic factors and immune components but also could increase cell survival and Aβ clearance in cortex samples.

Characterizing White Matter Tract Degeneration in Syndromic Variants of Alzheimer's Disease: A Diffusion Tensor Imaging Study,"Background:Different clinical syndromes can arise from Alzheimer's disease (AD) neuropathology, including dementia of the Alzheimer's type (DAT), logopenic primary progressive aphasia (lvPPA), and posterior cortical atrophy (PCA).Objective:To assess similarities and differences in patterns of white matter tract degeneration across these syndromic variants of AD.Methods:Sixty-four subjects (22 DAT, 24 lvPPA, and 18 PCA) that had diffusion tensor imaging and showed amyloid-β deposition on PET were assessed in this case-control study. A whole-brain voxel-based analysis was performed to assess differences in fractional anisotropy, mean diffusivity, axial diffusivity, and radial diffusivity across groups.Results:All three groups showed overlapping diffusion abnormalities in a network of tracts, including fornix, corpus callosum, posterior thalamic radiations, superior longitudinal fasciculus, inferior longitudinal fasciculus, inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus, and uncinate fasciculus. Subtle regional differences were also observed across groups, with DAT particularly associated with degeneration of fornix and cingulum, lvPPA with left inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus and uncinate fasciculus, and PCA with posterior thalamic radiations, superior longitudinal fasciculus, posterior cingulate, and splenium of the corpus callosum.Conclusion:These findings show that while each AD phenotype is associated with degeneration of a specific structural network of white matter tracts, striking spatial overlap exists among the three network patterns that may be related to AD pathology.",26484918,PMC10038690,10.3233/JAD-150502,16

Olfactory bulb neuroproteomics reveals a chronological perturbation of survival routes and a disruption of prohibitin complex during Alzheimer's disease progression,"Olfactory dysfunction is among the earliest features of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Although neuropathological abnormalities have been detected in the olfactory bulb (OB), little is known about its dynamic biology. Here, OB- proteome analysis showed a stage-dependent synaptic proteostasis impairment during AD evolution. In addition to progressive modulation of tau and amyloid precursor protein (APP) interactomes, network-driven proteomics revealed an early disruption of upstream and downstream p38 MAPK pathway and a subsequent impairment of Phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase 1 (PDK1)/Protein kinase C (PKC) signaling axis in the OB from AD subjects. Moreover, a mitochondrial imbalance was evidenced by a depletion of Prohibitin-2 (Phb2) levels and a specific decrease in the phosphorylated isoforms of Phb1 in intermediate and advanced AD stages. Interestingly, olfactory Phb subunits were also deregulated across different types of dementia. Phb2 showed a specific up-regulation in mixed dementia, while Phb1 isoforms were down-regulated in frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD). However, no differences were observed in the olfactory expression of Phb subunits in progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP). To sum up, our data reflect, in part, the missing links in the biochemical understanding of olfactory dysfunction in AD, unveiling Phb complex as a differential driver of neurodegeneration at olfactory level.",28831118,PMC5567385,10.1038/s41598-017-09481-x,40
Hawaiian native herb Mamaki prevents dementia by ameliorating neuropathology and repairing neurons in four different mouse models of neurodegenerative diseases,"Neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's disease, frontotemporal dementia, and dementia with Lewy bodies are age-related disorders and the main cause of dementia. They are characterized by the cerebral accumulation of Aβ, tau, α-synuclein, and TDP-43. Because the accumulation begins decades before disease onset, treatment should be started in the preclinical stage. Such intervention would be long-lasting, and therefore, prophylactic agents should be safe, non-invasively taken by the patients, and inexpensive. In addition, the agents should be broadly effective against etiologic proteins and capable of repairing neurons damaged by toxic oligomers. These requirements are difficult to meet with single-ingredient pharmaceuticals but may be feasible by taking proper diets composed of multiple ingredients. As a source of such diets, we focused on the Hawaiian native herb Mamaki. From its dried leaves and fruits, we made three preparations: hot water extract of the leaves, non-extracted simple crush powder of the leaves, and simple crush powder of the fruits, and examined their effects on the cognitive function and neuropathologies in four different mouse models of neurodegenerative dementia. Hot water extract of the leaves attenuated neuropathologies, restored synaptophysin levels, suppressed microglial activation, and improved memory when orally administered for 1 month. Simply crushed leaf powder showed a higher efficacy, but simply crushed fruit powder displayed the strongest effects. Moreover, the fruit powder significantly enhanced the levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor expression and neurogenesis, indicating its ability to repair neurons. These results suggest that crushed Mamaki leaves and fruits are promising sources of dementia-preventive diets.",37783918,PMC10828292,10.1007/s11357-023-00950-y,0

"FACEmemory®, an Innovative Online Platform for Episodic Memory Pre-Screening: Findings from the First 3,000 Participants","Background:The FACEmemory® online platform comprises a complex memory test and sociodemographic, medical, and family questions. This is the first study of a completely self-administered memory test with voice recognition, pre-tested in a memory clinic, sensitive to Alzheimer's disease, using information and communication technologies, and offered freely worldwide.Objective:To investigate the demographic and clinical variables associated with the total FACEmemory score, and to identify distinct patterns of memory performance on FACEmemory.Methods:Data from the first 3,000 subjects who completed the FACEmemory test were analyzed. Descriptive analyses were applied to demographic, FACEmemory, and medical and family variables; t-test and chi-square analyses were used to compare participants with preserved versus impaired performance on FACEmemory (cut-off = 32); multiple linear regression was used to identify variables that modulate FACEmemory performance; and machine learning techniques were applied to identify different memory patterns.Results:Participants had a mean age of 50.57 years and 13.65 years of schooling; 64.07% were women, and 82.10% reported memory complaints with worries. The group with impaired FACEmemory performance (20.40%) was older, had less schooling, and had a higher prevalence of hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidemia, and family history of neurodegenerative disease than the group with preserved performance. Age, schooling, sex, country, and completion of the medical and family history questionnaire were associated with the FACEmemory score. Finally, machine learning techniques identified four patterns of FACEmemory performance: normal, dysexecutive, storage, and completely impaired.Conclusions:FACEmemory is a promising tool for assessing memory in people with subjective memory complaints and for raising awareness about cognitive decline in the community.",38217602,PMC10977414,10.3233/JAD-230983,1
Multi-Ethnic Norms for Volumes of Subcortical and Lobar Brain Structures Measured by Neuro I: Ethnicity May Improve the Diagnosis of Alzheimer's Disease1,"Background:We previously demonstrated the validity of a regression model that included ethnicity as a novel predictor for predicting normative brain volumes in old age. The model was optimized using brain volumes measured with a standard tool FreeSurfer.Objective:Here we further verified the prediction model using newly estimated brain volumes from Neuro I, a quantitative brain analysis system developed for Korean populations.Methods:Lobar and subcortical volumes were estimated from MRI images of 1,629 normal Korean and 786 Caucasian subjects (age range 59-89) and were predicted in linear regression from ethnicity, age, sex, intracranial volume, magnetic field strength, and scanner manufacturers.Results:In the regression model predicting the new volumes, ethnicity was again a substantial predictor in most regions. Additionally, the model-based z-scores of regions were calculated for 428 AD patients and the matched controls, and then employed for diagnostic classification. When the AD classifier adopted the z-scores adjusted for ethnicity, the diagnostic accuracy has noticeably improved (AUC = 0.85, ΔAUC = + 0.04, D = 4.10, p < 0.001).Conclusions:Our results suggest that the prediction model remains robust across different measurement tool, and ethnicity significantly contributes to the establishment of norms for brain volumes and the development of a diagnostic system for neurodegenerative diseases.",38640153,,10.3233/JAD-231182,0
[Assessment of the knowledge of Lewy body disease by health care professionnels compared to Alzheimer's disease: result of a descriptive analytical study],"Background:Dementia with Lewy body (DLB) is a common neurodegenerative disease that warrants specific care, which remains largely underdiagnosed. Our objective was to assess the knowledge of DLB by health professionals in comparison with that of Alzheimer's disease (AD), to better understand the reasons of its under-diagnosis.Methods:We conducted a descriptive and analytical study processing the results of an online questionnaire submitted to French healthcare professionals between December 1, 2020 and March 1, 2021.Results:A total of 490 healthcare professionals responded to the questionnaire. We observed a poorer knowledge of DLB compared to AD both subjective as highlighted on the self-assessment questionnaires and objective since the diagnostic criteria and therapeutic specificities were less known for DLB compared to AD.Conclusions:DLB appears as a disease that is still too poorly known by health professionals. To improve training is therefore a decisive objective in order to optimize the therapeutic care and support of patients with DLB and their relatives.",34405805,,10.1684/pnv.2021.0949,0
"[Posterior cortical atrophy, a rare neurodegenerative disease with predominantly visual complaints]","Posterior cortical atrophy (PCA) is a neurodegenerative disease which was described originally in 1988 by dr Frank Benson. PCA is characterized by progressive deficits in higher visual functions while episodic memory and speech are relatively preserved. Studies have shown that the neuropathologic findings in most cases are consistent with Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, patients with PCA show greater occipitoparietal atrophy on neuroimaging compared with the more prominent mesiotemporal atrophy in patients with amnestic AD. Until recently, diagnostics were based mainly on clinical experience due to the lack of validated diagnostic criteria. In 2017, new consensus criteria for the diagnosis and classification of PCA were published. In this article we make a brief review of the disease and describe a 58 year old man with complex visual deficits and apraxia who was ultimately diagnosed with PCA.",33491762,,,0
[A patient with vision problems: first manifestation of a neurodegenerative condition],"Background:Vision problems are common and the causes are diverse. This case illustrates the fact that vision problems may also be the first manifestation of a neurodegenerative disorder.Case description:A 46-year-old male developed progressive, incapacitating vision problems. Multiple pairs of glasses with lenses of different strengths did not improve symptoms. No ophthalmological explanation of the problems could be found. Oculomotor apraxia and visual extinction were seen on neurological examination. Visuoperceptual impairment was the main finding on neuropsychological examination. Impairment was also identified in visuoconstruction, memory and praxis.Conclusion:Cognitive problems in several areas, interference with activities of daily living, and young age of onset complete the clinical picture of presenile dementia. Posterior cortical atrophy is a spectrum of neurodegenerative disorders, characterized by progressive, incapacitating visuospatial and visuoperceptual impairment. The most prevalent underlying pathology is Alzheimer's disease. At present there is no curative therapy for posterior cortical atrophy.",26374721,,,0

Dietary phytochemicals that influence gut microbiota: Roles and actions as anti-Alzheimer agents,"The last decide has witnessed a growing research interest in the role of dietary phytochemicals in influencing the gut microbiota. On the other hand, recent evidence reveals that dietary phytochemicals exhibit properties of preventing and tackling symptoms of Alzheimer's disease, which is a neurodegenerative disease that has also been linked with the status of the gut microbiota over the last decade. Till now, little serious discussions, however, have been made to link recent understanding of Alzheimer's disease, dietary phytochemicals and the gut microbiota together and to review the roles played by phytochemicals in gut dysbiosis induced pathologies of Alzheimer's disease. Deciphering these connections can provide insights into the development and future use of dietary phytochemicals as anti-Alzheimer drug candidates. This review aims at presenting latest evidence in the modulating role of phytochemicals in the gut microbiota and its relevance to Alzheimer's disease and summarizing the mechanisms behind the modulative activities. Limitations of current research in this field and potential directions will also be discussed for future research on dietary phytochemicals as anti-Alzheimer agents.",33559482,,10.1080/10408398.2021.1882381,4
Aquaporin-4 cerebrospinal fluid levels are higher in neurodegenerative dementia: looking at glymphatic system dysregulation,"Aquaporin-4 (AQP4) is a channel protein that plays a fundamental role in glymphatic system, a newly described pathway for fluid exchange in the central nervous system, as well as a central figure in a fascinating new theory for the pathophysiology of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). In this study, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) concentration of AQP4, amyloid-β, total tau and P-tau were determined in 103 CSF samples from patients affected by neurodegenerative dementias (AD and FTD) or psychiatric diseases and 21 controls. Significantly higher levels of AQP4 were found in AD and FTD patients compared to subjects not affected by neurodegenerative diseases, and a significant, positive correlation between AQP4 and total tau levels was found. This evidence may pave the way for future studies focused on the role of this channel protein in the clinical assessment of the glymphatic function and degree of neurodegeneration.",36115967,PMC9482276,10.1186/s13195-022-01077-6,11
Instantiated mixed effects modeling of Alzheimer's disease markers,"The assessment and prediction of a subject's current and future risk of developing neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's disease are of great interest in both the design of clinical trials as well as in clinical decision making. Exploring the longitudinal trajectory of markers related to neurodegeneration is an important task when selecting subjects for treatment in trials and the clinic, in the evaluation of early disease indicators and the monitoring of disease progression. Given that there is substantial intersubject variability, models that attempt to describe marker trajectories for a whole population will likely lack specificity for the representation of individual patients. Therefore, we argue here that individualized models provide a more accurate alternative that can be used for tasks such as population stratification and a subject-specific prognosis. In the work presented here, mixed effects modeling is used to derive global and individual marker trajectories for a training population. Test subject (new patient) specific models are then instantiated using a stratified ""marker signature"" that defines a subpopulation of similar cases within the training database. From this subpopulation, personalized models of the expected trajectory of several markers are subsequently estimated for unseen patients. These patient specific models of markers are shown to provide better predictions of time-to-conversion to Alzheimer's disease than population based models.",27381077,,10.1016/j.neuroimage.2016.06.049,14
Tau-based therapies in neurodegeneration: opportunities and challenges,"Aggregates of the microtubule-associated protein tau are a defining feature of several neurodegenerative diseases that are collectively known as tauopathies, and constitute one of the hallmark lesions of Alzheimer disease (AD). Given the lack of efficacy to date of amyloid-β-targeted therapies for AD, interest is growing in tau as a potential alternative target. Several drug candidates, which are now in clinical trials, aim to reduce tau levels or to prevent the aggregation or pathological post-translation modifications of this protein. In this Review, we discuss preclinical and clinical studies in light of an increased understanding of the physiological and pathological roles of tau, advances in animal models of tauopathy, the identification of novel targets and the availability of novel tracers to track tau.",28983098,,10.1038/nrd.2017.155,97
Neuroprotective factors affect the progression of Alzheimer's disease,"Alzheimer's disease(AD) is a neurodegenerative disease that occurs mostly in the elderly and is characterized by chronic progressive cognitive dysfunction, which seriously threatens the health and life-quality of patients. Alterations at the molecular level, which causes pathological changes of AD brain, have impacted the progression of AD. In this review, we illustrate the recent evidence of the alteration of neuroprotective proteins in AD, such as changes in their contents and variants. Furthermore, we elucidate the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) and gene changes. Finally, we highlight the epigenetic changes in AD, which helps to display the characteristics of the disease and provides guidance regarding research hot spots in the field against AD.",37797415,,10.1016/j.bbrc.2023.09.042,0
Bias induced by ignoring double truncation inherent in autopsy-confirmed survival studies of neurodegenerative diseases,"Neurodegenerative diseases require an autopsy for confirmation of diagnosis. When death is the event of interest, studies based on autopsy-confirmed diagnoses result in right truncated survival times because individuals who live past the end of study date do not receive a pathological diagnosis and are therefore not included in the sample. Furthermore, many studies of neurodegenerative diseases recruit subjects only after the onset of the disease, which may result in left truncated survival times. Therefore, double truncation, the simultaneous presence of left and right truncation, is inherent in many autopsy-confirmed survival studies of neurodegenerative diseases. The main focus of this paper is to inform about the inherent double truncation in these studies and demonstrate how to properly estimate and compare survival distribution functions in this setting. We do so by conducting a case study of subjects with autopsy-confirmed Alzheimer's disease and frontotemporal lobar degeneration. This case study is supported by extensive simulation studies, which provide several new contributions to the literature on survival distribution estimation in the context of double truncation.",31062392,PMC6625863,10.1002/sim.8185,3
Tau filaments in neurodegenerative diseases,"The ordered assembly of Tau protein into abnormal filamentous inclusions is a defining characteristic of many human neurodegenerative diseases. Thirty years ago, we reported that Tau is an integral component of the intraneuronal filaments of Alzheimer's disease. All six brain Tau isoforms make up those filaments. Twenty years ago, we and others showed that mutations in MAPT, the Tau gene, cause familial forms of frontotemporal dementia, thus proving that dysfunction of Tau protein is sufficient to cause neurodegeneration and dementia. More recently, we showed that high-resolution structures of Tau filaments from human brain can be determined by electron cryo-microscopy. These filaments may form the seeds that underlie the prion-like properties of aggregated tau.",29790176,,10.1002/1873-3468.13108,63
Neuroimaging Modalities in Alzheimer's Disease: Diagnosis and Clinical Features,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease causing progressive cognitive decline until eventual death. AD affects millions of individuals worldwide in the absence of effective treatment options, and its clinical causes are still uncertain. The onset of dementia symptoms indicates severe neurodegeneration has already taken place. Therefore, AD diagnosis at an early stage is essential as it results in more effective therapy to slow its progression. The current clinical diagnosis of AD relies on mental examinations and brain imaging to determine whether patients meet diagnostic criteria, and biomedical research focuses on finding associated biomarkers by using neuroimaging techniques. Multiple clinical brain imaging modalities emerged as potential techniques to study AD, showing a range of capacity in their preciseness to identify the disease. This review presents the advantages and limitations of brain imaging modalities for AD diagnosis and discusses their clinical value.",35682758,PMC9181385,10.3390/ijms23116079,10
"The Return of Biomarker Results in Research: Balancing Complexity, Precision, and Ethical Responsibility","Recent research aimed at the discovery, integration, and communication of health outcome measures (or ""biomarkers"") in Alzheimer's disease has raised challenging questions related to whether, how and when results from these investigations should be disclosed to research participants. Reflecting the apparent heterogeneity of many neurodegenerative diseases, biomarker or other risk factor results are often probabilistic, interactive, multi-modal, and selective. Such characteristics make it very complex to summarize and communicate to clinicians, researchers, and research participants. Whereas the format and content of academic literature is well-managed by the peer-review process, reporting individualized results to participants involves complex, sensitive, and ethical considerations. This paper describes three key factors to consider in decisions about the return of results to research participants: complexity, precision, and responsibility. The paper also presents six practical recommendations for implementing meaningful and ethical communication with research participants.",38306053,PMC10836546,10.3233/JAD-230359,0
Repurposing Artificial Intelligence Tools for Disease Modeling: Case Study of Face Recognition Deficits in Neurodegenerative Diseases,"Face recognition deficits occur in diseases such as prosopagnosia, autism, Alzheimer's disease, and dementias. The objective of this study was to evaluate whether degrading the architecture of artificial intelligence (AI) face recognition algorithms can model deficits in diseases. Two established face recognition models, convolutional-classification neural network (C-CNN) and Siamese network (SN), were trained on the FEI faces data set (~ 14 images/person for 200 persons). The trained networks were perturbed by reducing weights (weakening) and node count (lesioning) to emulate brain tissue dysfunction and lesions, respectively. Accuracy assessments were used as surrogates for face recognition deficits. The findings were compared with clinical outcomes from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) data set. Face recognition accuracy decreased gradually for weakening factors less than 0.55 for C-CNN, and 0.85 for SN. Rapid accuracy loss occurred at higher values. C-CNN accuracy was similarly affected by weakening any convolutional layer whereas SN accuracy was more sensitive to weakening of the first convolutional layer. SN accuracy declined gradually with a rapid drop when nearly all nodes were lesioned. C-CNN accuracy declined rapidly when as few as 10% of nodes were lesioned. CNN and SN were more sensitive to lesioning of the first convolutional layer. Overall, SN was more robust than C-CNN, and the findings from SN experiments were concordant with ADNI results. As predicted from modeling, brain network failure quotient was related to key clinical outcome measures for cognition and functioning. Perturbation of AI networks is a promising method for modeling disease progression effects on complex cognitive outcomes.",37394678,,10.1002/cpt.2987,1
Role of Cholinergic Signaling in Alzheimer's Disease,"Acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter secreted by cholinergic neurons, is involved in signal transduction related to memory and learning ability. Alzheimer's disease (AD), a progressive and commonly diagnosed neurodegenerative disease, is characterized by memory and cognitive decline and behavioral disorders. The pathogenesis of AD is complex and remains unclear, being affected by various factors. The cholinergic hypothesis is the earliest theory about the pathogenesis of AD. Cholinergic atrophy and cognitive decline are accelerated in age-related neurodegenerative diseases such as AD. In addition, abnormal central cholinergic changes can also induce abnormal phosphorylation of ttau protein, nerve cell inflammation, cell apoptosis, and other pathological phenomena, but the exact mechanism of action is still unclear. Due to the complex and unclear pathogenesis, effective methods to prevent and treat AD are unavailable, and research to explore novel therapeutic drugs is various and active in the world. This review summaries the role of cholinergic signaling and the correlation between the cholinergic signaling pathway with other risk factors in AD and provides the latest research about the efficient therapeutic drugs and treatment of AD.",35335180,PMC8949236,10.3390/molecules27061816,72
A mathematical model on the propagation of tau pathology in neurodegenerative diseases,"A system of partial differential equations is developed to study the spreading of tau pathology in the brain for Alzheimer's and other neurodegenerative diseases. Two cases are considered with one assuming intracellular diffusion through synaptic activities or the nanotubes that connect the adjacent cells. The other, in addition to intracellular spreading, takes into account of the secretion of the tau species which are able to diffuse, move with the interstitial fluid flow and subsequently taken up by the surrounding cells providing an alternative pathway for disease spreading. Cross membrane transport of the tau species are considered enabling us to examine the role of extracellular clearance of tau protein on the disease status. Bifurcation analysis is carried out for the steady states of the spatially homogeneous system yielding the results that fast cross-membrane transport combined with effective extracellular clearance is key to maintain the brain's healthy status. Numerical simulations of the first case exhibit solutions of travelling wave form describing the gradual outward spreading of the pathology; whereas the second case shows faster spreading with the buildup of neurofibrillary tangles quickly elevated throughout. Our investigation thus indicates that the gradual progression of the intracellular spreading case is more consistent with the clinical observations of the development of Alzheimer's disease.",38750128,,10.1007/s00285-024-02101-z,0
Omega-3 Fatty Acids: Repurposing Opportunities for Cognition and Biobehavioral Disturbances in MCI and Dementia,"Neurodegenerative diseases may directly affect memory performance, thus leading to functional impairments. An increasing body of evidence suggests an association between dietary intake of omega-3 fatty acids and memory functioning in animal models as well as in human studies. Recent evidence supports a potential beneficial role of omega-3 fatty acid supplementation on psychopathological and cognitive symptoms, beside their established positive effects on cardiovascular health.Objective:We summarize relevant and recent evidence from epidemiological, interventional and experimental studies investigating dietary consumption of omega-3 fatty acids and emphazing mechanisms of memory disorders, with a focus on mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia. Omega-3 fatty acid could represent an affordable and accessible adjunctive treatment option to improve cognitive and non-cognitive function with a focus on MCI or dementia. However, apart from its translational promise, which is based on mechanistic models and evidence from animal studies, evidence for clinical benefits in humans is lacking.Method:To follow this research question, a search through electronic databases for the following search terms to identify relevant studies was conducted: 'omega 3 fatty acids', 'cognition', 'memory', ´Alzheimer´s Disease ´, ´dementia´, ´MCI`. Studies were included if they presented original data and were published in English between 1990 and 2015.Results:To our the best of our knowledge, there are only 8 interventional studies that investigated the effects of n3-PUFAs in dementia patients, while 6 studies were conducted in healthy individuals, which in combination show equivocal results.Conclusion:This verifies the need for larger and (more) well designed clinical trials.",27335040,,10.2174/1567205013666160602235520,3
The promise of microRNA-based therapies in Alzheimer's disease: challenges and perspectives,"Multi-pathway approaches for the treatment of complex polygenic disorders are emerging as alternatives to classical monotarget therapies and microRNAs are of particular interest in that regard. MicroRNA research has come a long way from their initial discovery to the cumulative appreciation of their regulatory potential in healthy and diseased brain. However, systematic interrogation of putative therapeutic or toxic effects of microRNAs in (models of) Alzheimer's disease is currently missing and fundamental research findings are yet to be translated into clinical applications. Here, we review the literature to summarize the knowledge on microRNA regulation in Alzheimer's pathophysiology and to critically discuss whether and to what extent these increasing insights can be exploited for the development of microRNA-based therapeutics in the clinic.",34742333,PMC8572071,10.1186/s13024-021-00496-7,33
Blood-Based Transcriptomic Biomarkers Are Predictive of Neurodegeneration Rather Than Alzheimer's Disease,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a growing global health crisis affecting millions and incurring substantial economic costs. However, clinical diagnosis remains challenging, with misdiagnoses and underdiagnoses being prevalent. There is an increased focus on putative, blood-based biomarkers that may be useful for the diagnosis as well as early detection of AD. In the present study, we used an unbiased combination of machine learning and functional network analyses to identify blood gene biomarker candidates in AD. Using supervised machine learning, we also determined whether these candidates were indeed unique to AD or whether they were indicative of other neurodegenerative diseases, such as Parkinson's disease (PD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Our analyses showed that genes involved in spliceosome assembly, RNA binding, transcription, protein synthesis, mitoribosomes, and NADH dehydrogenase were the best-performing genes for identifying AD patients relative to cognitively healthy controls. This transcriptomic signature, however, was not unique to AD, and subsequent machine learning showed that this signature could also predict PD and ALS relative to controls without neurodegenerative disease. Combined, our results suggest that mRNA from whole blood can indeed be used to screen for patients with neurodegeneration but may be less effective in diagnosing the specific neurodegenerative disease.",37834458,PMC10573468,10.3390/ijms241915011,0
The regulatory mechanism and therapeutic potential of transcription factor EB in neurodegenerative diseases,"The autophagy-lysosomal pathway (ALP) is involved in the degradation of protein aggregates and damaged organelles. Transcription factor EB (TFEB), a major regulator of ALP, has emerged as a leading factor in addressing neurodegenerative disease pathology, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), PolyQ diseases, and Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). In this review, we delineate the regulation of TFEB expression and its functions in ALP. Dysfunctions of TFEB and its role in the pathogenesis of several neurodegenerative diseases are reviewed. We summarize the protective effects and molecular mechanisms of some TFEB-targeted agonists in neurodegenerative diseases. We also offer our perspective on analyzing the pros and cons of these agonists in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases from the perspective of drug development. More studies on the regulatory mechanisms of TFEB in other biological processes will aid our understanding of the application of TFEB-targeted therapy in neurodegeneration.",36184826,PMC9804079,10.1111/cns.13985,1
Molecular Biomarkers of Neuronal Injury in Epilepsy Shared with Neurodegenerative Diseases,"In neurodegenerative diseases, changes in neuronal proteins in the cerebrospinal fluid and blood are viewed as potential biomarkers of the primary pathology in the central nervous system (CNS). Recent reports suggest, however, that level of neuronal proteins in fluids also alters in several types of epilepsy in various age groups, including children. With increasing evidence supporting clinical and sub-clinical seizures in Alzheimer's disease, Lewy body dementia, Parkinson's disease, and in other less common neurodegenerative conditions, these findings call into question the specificity of neuronal protein response to neurodegenerative process and urge analysis of the effects of concomitant epilepsy and other comorbidities. In this article, we revisit the evidence for alterations in neuronal proteins in the blood and cerebrospinal fluid associated with epilepsy with and without neurodegenerative diseases. We discuss shared and distinctive characteristics of changes in neuronal markers, review their neurobiological mechanisms, and consider the emerging opportunities and challenges for their future research and diagnostic use.",36884195,PMC10275849,10.1007/s13311-023-01355-7,3
Tau Abnormalities and the Potential Therapy in Alzheimer's Disease,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is one of the most prevalent neurodegenerative diseases that is characterized by progressive memory loss and two main pathological hallmarks, including the extracellular amyloid plaques and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles. The microtubule-related protein tau is involved in the pathogenesis of many neurological diseases commonly known as tauopathies and is found to be abnormally hyperphosphorylated in AD and accumulated in neurons. Besides hyperphosphorylation, tau also undergoes abnormal glycosylation, ubiquitination, glycation, and other posttranslational modifications. These abnormalities lead to the aberrant aggregation of tau in the synaptic loci in AD. In this review, we highlighted the most recent studies about how tau is abnormally regulated and how those abnormalities play important roles in the pathogenesis of AD.",30507581,,10.3233/JAD-180868,10
Toward Reagent-Free Discrimination of Alzheimer's Disease Using Blood Plasma Spectral Digital Biomarkers and Machine Learning,"Background:Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prevalent neurodegenerative disease. The detection of early-stage AD is particularly desirable because it would allow early intervention. However, a minimally invasive, low-cost, and accurate discrimination or diagnostic method for AD is especially difficult in the earliest stage of AD.Objective:The aim of this research is to discover blood plasma spectral digital biomarkers of AD, develop a novel intelligent method for the discrimination of AD and accelerate the translation of Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectral-based disease discrimination methods from the laboratory to clinical practice.Methods:Since vibration spectroscopy can provide the structure and chemical composition information of biological samples at the molecular level, we investigated the potential of FTIR spectral biomarkers of blood plasma to differentiate between AD patients and healthy controls. Combined with machine learning technology, we designed a hierarchical discrimination system that provides reagent-free and accurate AD discrimination based on blood plasma spectral digital biomarkers of AD.Results:Accurate segregation between AD patients and healthy controls was achieved with 89.3% sensitivity and 85.7% specificity for early-stage AD patients, 92.8% sensitivity and 87.5% specificity for middle-stage AD patients, and 100% sensitivity and 100% specificity for late-stage AD patients.Conclusions:Our results show that blood plasma spectral digital biomarkers hold great promise as discrimination markers of AD, indicating the potential for the development of an inexpensive, reagent-free, and less laborious clinical test. As a result, our research outcome will accelerate the clinical application of spectral digital biomarkers and machine learning.",37661884,,10.3233/JAD-230248,0
"First-In-Human Safety, Tolerability, and Pharmacokinetics of Single and Multiple Doses of AZP2006, A Synthetic Compound for the Treatment of Alzheimer's Disease and Related Diseases","Background:Alzheimer's disease (AD) and progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) are major neurodegenerative conditions with tau pathology in common but distinct symptoms-AD involves cognitive decline while PSP affects balance and eye movement. Progranulin (PGRN) is a growth factor implicated in neurodegenerative diseases, including AD and PSP. AZP2006, a synthetic compound, targets tauopathies by stabilizing PGRN levels and reducing tau aggregation and neuroinflammation.Objective:Evaluate the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of AZP2006.Methods:A first-in-Human phase 1 study comprised a single ascending dose (SAD) and a multiple ascending dose study (MAD). The SAD study included 64 healthy male volunteers and tested singles oral doses of 3 to 500 mg of AZP2006 free base equivalent or placebo. In the MAD study, 24 healthy male volunteers were administered oral doses of 30, 60, and 120 mg per day of AZP2006 or placebo for 10 days.Results:No serious adverse events were observed. Clinical, biological, and electrocardiogram findings were non-relevant. Nineteen minor adverse events resolved before study completion. The safety profile indicated no specific risks. The multiple ascending dose study was halted, and the optional dose level of 180 mg was not performed due to high levels of M2 metabolite in plasma that necessitated additional preclinical evaluation of M2. Both AZP2006 and its M2 metabolite were quickly absorbed and widely distributed in tissues. Exposure increased more than proportionally with dose.Conclusions:AZP2006 had a favorable safety profile and was rapidly absorbed. Elevated M2 metabolite levels necessitated further studies to clarify excretion and metabolism mechanisms.",38427472,,10.3233/JAD-220883,0
Evaluating the link between Paraoxonase-1 levels and Alzheimer's disease development,"At present, the etiopathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common form of dementia, remains far to be fully deciphered. In the recent years, also the centrality of amyloid-β peptide in the pathogenesis of the neurodegenerative disease has been questioned and other hypotheses have been advanced. Notably, a common denominator of many of these theoretical models is represented by oxidative stress, which is widely proposed to play a role in the disease initiation and/or progression. Paraoxonase 1 (PON1) is a high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-associated enzyme that endows its carrier with multiple biological functions, including the ability to contrast oxidative damage to lipid components of lipoproteins and cells and protect from toxicity of specific organophosphorus pesticides. The peculiar multi-functionality nature of PON1 might be the key for explaining the vast epidemiological data showing a close association between low serum PON1 activity and risk of several diseases, including cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases, in particular AD. In this review, we discuss the possible link between PON1 with AD pathogenesis and we hypothesize eventual mechanistic pathways that could account from epidemiological observations. We also highlight the methodological issue limitation in PON1 studies that still impede to give a definitive and certain picture of its effective biological impact on human health including AD.",30334443,PMC7451062,10.23736/S0026-4806.18.05875-5,20
A review on omics-based biomarkers discovery for Alzheimer's disease from the bioinformatics perspectives: Statistical approach vs machine learning approach,"Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease that affects cognition and is the most common cause of dementia in the elderly. As the number of elderly individuals increases globally, the incidence and prevalence of AD are expected to increase. At present, AD is diagnosed clinically, according to accepted criteria. The essential elements in the diagnosis of AD include a patients history, a physical examination and neuropsychological testing, in addition to appropriate investigations such as neuroimaging. The omics-based approach is an emerging field of study that may not only aid in the diagnosis of AD but also facilitate the exploration of factors that influence the development of the disease. Omics techniques, including genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics and metabolomics, may reveal the pathways that lead to neuronal death and identify biomolecular markers associated with AD. This will further facilitate an understanding of AD neuropathology. In this review, omics-based approaches that were implemented in studies on AD were assessed from a bioinformatics perspective. Current state-of-the-art statistical and machine learning approaches used in the single omics analysis of AD were compared based on correlations of variants, differential expression, functional analysis and network analysis. This was followed by a review of the approaches used in the integration and analysis of multi-omics of AD. The strengths and limitations of multi-omics analysis methods were explored and the issues and challenges associated with omics studies of AD were highlighted. Lastly, future studies in this area of research were justified.",34678481,,10.1016/j.compbiomed.2021.104947,15
[Modern conception of the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases and therapeutic strategy],"Here we discuss the pathogenesis of the inflammatory and degenerative nervous system disorders on the example of Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, multiple sclerosis. Common mechanisms of neurodegeneration in these diseases are reviewed. The role of neurodegeneration as the main process leading to the resistant disability of patients with multiple sclerosis is discussed. The authors consider a contribution of inflammatory process and chronic infection to the manifestation and progressing of a neurodegenerative disease and discuss the use of treatment not usually indicated including interferon, anti-inflammatory drugs, statin, vitamin D, monoclonal antibodies, correction of the intestinal microbiota in Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease.",28980606,,10.17116/jnevro2017117623-10,2
Cerebral vasomotor reactivity in neurodegenerative diseases,"Small-caliber cerebral vessels change their diameters in response to alterations of key metabolite concentrations such as carbon dioxide or oxygen. This phenomenon, termed the cerebral vasomotor reactivity (CVMR), is the basis for blood flow regulation in the brain in accordance with its metabolic status. Typically, CVMR is determined as the amount of change in cerebral blood flow in response to a vasodilating stimulus, which can be measured by various neuroimaging methods or by transcranial Doppler. It has been shown that CVMR is impaired in cerebrovascular diseases, but there is also evidence of a similar dysfunction in neurodegenerative disorders. Here, we review studies that have investigated CVMR in the common neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease and multiple sclerosis. Moreover, we discuss potential neurodegenerative mechanisms responsible for the impairment of CVMR.",27553189,,10.1016/j.pjnns.2016.07.011,13
Nanocarrier mediated drug delivery as an impeccable therapeutic approach against Alzheimer's disease,"For the past several years, dementia, is one of the predominantly observed groups of symptoms in a geriatric population. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive memory related neurodegenerative disease, for which the current Food and drug administration approved therapeutics are only meant for a symptomatic management rather than targeting the root cause of AD. These therapeutics belong to two classes, Acetylcholine Esterase inhibitors and N-methyl D-aspartate antagonist. Furthermore, to facilitate neuroprotective action in AD, the drugs are majorly expected to reach the specific target area in the brain for the desired efficacy. Thus, there is a huge requirement for drug discovery and development for facilitating the entry of drugs more in brain to exert a specific action. The very first line of defense and the major limitation for the entry of drugs into the brain is the Blood Brain Barrier, followed by Blood-Cerebrospinal Fluid Barrier. More than a barrier, these mainly act as selectively permeable membranes, which allows entry of specific molecules into the brain. Furthermore, specific enzymes result in the degradation of xenobiotics. All these mechanisms pose as hurdles in the way of effective drug delivery in the brain. Thus, novel techniques need to be harbored for the facilitation of the delivery of such drugs into the brain. Nanocarriers are advantageous for facilitating the specific targeted drug treatment in AD. As nanomedicines are one of the novels and most useful approaches for AD, thus the present review mainly focuses on understanding the advanced use of nanocarriers for targeted drug delivery in the management of AD.",35114208,,10.1016/j.jconrel.2022.01.044,10
The Potential of Neurofilament Light as a Biomarker in Alzheimer's Disease,"Background:Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disease characterized by progressive memory loss and cognitive impairment. In 2011, the National Institute on Aging and Alzheimer's Association (NIA-AA) Research Framework has proposed to use biomarkers to diagnose AD in living persons. AD core biomarkers show high diagnostic specificity in distinguishing AD from healthy control subjects, but have little additional value for prognosis or stage of disease.Summary:With the update of detection methods and techniques, other AD biomarkers have been discovered. Neurofilament light (NFL) is currently recognized as a biomarker of nerve axonal injury and one of the candidate markers in AD neurodegeneration, and the relationship between NFL and AD pathophysiology has attracted widespread attention. More and more studies have shown that NFL plays an important role in predicting the clinical progress and prognosis of AD. Recently, the genome-wide association study also found that multiple single-nucleotide polymorphisms are associated with NFL levels and AD risk. Key Messages: In this review, we discuss the relationship between the genetic characteristics of NFL and AD, the NFL levels in AD, and the relationship between NFL and AD core biomarkers, neuroimaging, and cognitive performance.",33477142,,10.1159/000513008,8
Inverse correlation between Alzheimer's disease and cancer from the perspective of hypoxia,"Sporadic Alzheimer's disease and cancer remain epidemiologically inversely related, and exploring the reverse pathogenesis is important for our understanding of both. Cognitive dysfunctions in Alzheimer's disease (AD) might result from the depletion of adaptive reserves in the brain. Energy storage in the brain is limited and is dynamically regulated by neurovascular and neurometabolic coupling. The research on neurodegenerative diseases has been dominated by the neurocentric view that neuronal defects cause the diseases. However, the proposal of the 2-hit vascular hypothesis in AD led us to focus on alterations in the vasculature, especially hypoperfusion. Chronic hypoxia is a feature shared by AD and cancer. It is interesting how contradicting chronic hypoxia's effects on both cancer and AD are. In this article, we discuss the potential links between the 2 diseases' etiology, from comparable upstream circumstances to diametrically opposed downstream effects. We suggest opposing potential mechanisms, including upregulation and downregulation of hypoxia-inducible factor-1α, the Warburg and reverse-Warburg effects, lactate-mediated intracellular acidic and alkaline conditions, and VDAC1-mediated apoptosis and antiapoptosis, and search for regulators that may be identified as the crossroads between cancer and AD.",37572528,,10.1016/j.neurobiolaging.2023.07.002,0
"Medical Journey of Patients with Mild Cognitive Impairment and Mild Alzheimer's Disease Dementia: A Cross-sectional Survey of Patients, Care Partners, and Neurologists","Background:Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive, neurodegenerative disease presenting along a continuum ranging from asymptomatic disease to mild cognitive impairment (MCI), followed by dementia characterized as mild, moderate, or severe.Objectives:To better understand the medical journey of patients with all-cause MCI or mild AD dementia from the perspective of patients, care partners, and physicians.Design:Cross-sectional study.Setting:Online surveys in the United States between February 4, 2021, and March 1, 2021.Participants:103 patients with all-cause MCI or mild AD dementia and 150 care partners participated in this survey. 301 physicians (75 of whom were neurologists) completed a survey.Measurements:The surveys included questions regarding attitudes, experiences, and behaviors related to diagnosis and management of MCI and mild AD dementia. For the patient and care partner surveys, questions regarding healthcare received for MCI and mild AD dementia were only asked of care partners.Results:Most patients (73%) had a similar medical journey. The majority (64%) initially consulted a primary care physician on average 15 months after symptom onset, with symptoms primarily consisting of forgetfulness and short-term memory loss. About half (51%) of patients in the typical medical journey were diagnosed by a neurologist. Upon diagnosis, most neurologists reported having discussions with patients and care partners about the potential causes of MCI or mild AD dementia (83%); of these physicians, 83% explained the effect other conditions have on the risk of the diagnoses and symptom progression. Neurologists (52%) consider themselves the coordinator of care for patients with MCI or mild AD dementia. Amongst patients and care partners, about one-third (35%) perceive the neurologists to be the coordinating physician.Conclusions:Neurologists commonly diagnose MCI and mild AD dementia but are typically not the first point of contact in the medical journey, and patients do not consult with a physician for over a year after symptom onset. Neurologists play a key role in the medical journey for patients and care partners, and could help ensure earlier diagnosis and treatment, and improve clinical outcomes by coordinating MCI and mild AD dementia care and collaborating with primary care physicians.",36946442,,10.14283/jpad.2023.21,1
Role of Ketogenic Diets in Neurodegenerative Diseases (Alzheimer's Disease and Parkinson's Disease),"The goal of this review was to assess the effectiveness of ketogenic diets on the therapy of neurodegenerative diseases. The ketogenic diet is a low-carbohydrate and fat-rich diet. Its implementation has a fasting-like effect, which brings the body into a state of ketosis. The ketogenic diet has, for almost 100 years, been used in the therapy of drug-resistant epilepsy, but current studies indicate possible neuroprotective effects. Thus far, only a few studies have evaluated the role of the ketogenic diet in the prevention of Parkinson's disease (PD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). Single studies with human participants have demonstrated a reduction of disease symptoms after application. The application of the ketogenic diet to elderly people, however, raises certain concerns. Persons with neurodegenerative diseases are at risk of malnutrition, while food intake reduction is associated with disease symptoms. In turn, the ketogenic diet leads to a reduced appetite; it is not attractive from an organoleptic point of view, and may be accompanied by side effects of the gastrointestinal system. All this may lead to further lowering of consumed food portions by elderly persons with neurodegenerative diseases and, in consequence, to further reduction in the supply of nutrients provided by the diet. Neither data on the long-term application of the ketogenic diet in patients with neurodegenerative disease or data on its effects on disease symptoms are available. Further research is needed to evaluate the suitability of the ketogenic diet in the therapy of AD- or PD-affected persons.",30650523,PMC6356942,10.3390/nu11010169,110
Biochemical Pathways of Cellular Mechanosensing/Mechanotransduction and Their Role in Neurodegenerative Diseases Pathogenesis,"In this review, we shed light on recent advances regarding the characterization of biochemical pathways of cellular mechanosensing and mechanotransduction with particular attention to their role in neurodegenerative disease pathogenesis. While the mechanistic components of these pathways are mostly uncovered today, the crosstalk between mechanical forces and soluble intracellular signaling is still not fully elucidated. Here, we recapitulate the general concepts of mechanobiology and the mechanisms that govern the mechanosensing and mechanotransduction processes, and we examine the crosstalk between mechanical stimuli and intracellular biochemical response, highlighting their effect on cellular organelles' homeostasis and dysfunction. In particular, we discuss the current knowledge about the translation of mechanosignaling into biochemical signaling, focusing on those diseases that encompass metabolic accumulation of mutant proteins and have as primary characteristics the formation of pathological intracellular aggregates, such as Alzheimer's Disease, Huntington's Disease, Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis and Parkinson's Disease. Overall, recent findings elucidate how mechanosensing and mechanotransduction pathways may be crucial to understand the pathogenic mechanisms underlying neurodegenerative diseases and emphasize the importance of these pathways for identifying potential therapeutic targets.",36231055,PMC9563116,10.3390/cells11193093,6
Neurodegeneration enters the era of functional genomics,"There are no cures for the most common neurodegenerative diseases. None of the currently approved treatments cure or halt these conditions; rather, they address symptoms or slow disease progression. A focus on protein deposits in the brain-a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD)-has led to the development of immunotherapy drugs. Other promising avenues of investigation include the roles of neuroinflammation in neurodegeneration. However, the clinical impact of these approaches is still uncertain. What about exploiting our knowledge of the human genome and the ability to modify it with surgically precise tools? Can functional genomics approaches in neurodegenerative disease research provide the breakthroughs we need?",37676963,,10.1126/science.adk5693,1
Therapeutic nanotechnologies for Alzheimer's disease: A critical analysis of recent trends and findings,"Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is an irreversible neurodegenerative disease for which no modifying therapies are presently available. Besides the identification of pathological targets, AD presents numerous clinical and pharmacological challenges such as efficient active delivery to the central nervous system, cell targeting, and long-term dosing. Nanoparticles have been explored to overcome some of these challenges as drug delivery vehicles or drugs themselves. However, early promises have failed to materialize as no nanotechnology-based product has been able to reach the market and very few have moved past preclinical stages. In this review, we perform a critical analysis of the past decade's research on nanomedicine-based therapies for AD at the preclinical and clinical stages. The main obstacles to nanotechnology products and the most promising approaches were also identified, including renewed promise with gene editing, gene modulation, and vaccines.",35738546,,10.1016/j.addr.2022.114397,2
[Progress of experimental researches on acupuncture intervention for Alzheimer's disease based on SAMP8 mice model],"Alzheimer's disease (AD), also called senile dementia, is a neurodegenerative disease, characterized by progressive memory and cognitive impairment and different degrees of behavior-mental dysfunction. Clinical trials displayed that acupuncture therapy is effective in relieving symptoms of AD patients. In recent years, many experimental studies have been conducted in SAMP8 mice to explore the underlying mechanisms of acupuncture in improving AD. Results showed that acupuncture therapy can intervene the central pathological process of AD in multiple approaches, including reducing formation of cerebral β amyloid protein and promoting its removal, intervening the phosphorylation process of Tau protein, improving mitochondrial and synaptic structure, enhancing autophagy activity, accelerating cerebral blood flow, and increasing the levels of estrogen content, and improving the learning and memory ability, etc.",35616423,,10.13702/j.1000-0607.20210306,2
Tool use in neurodegenerative diseases: Planning or technical reasoning?,"Recent works showed that tool use can be impaired in stroke patients because of either planning or technical reasoning deficits, but these two hypotheses have not yet been compared in the field of neurodegenerative diseases. The aim of this study was to address the relationships between real tool use, mechanical problem-solving, and planning skills in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD, n = 32), semantic dementia (SD, n = 16), and corticobasal syndrome (CBS, n = 9). Patients were asked to select and use ten common tools, to solve three mechanical problems, and to complete the Tower of London test. Motor function and episodic memory were controlled using the Purdue Pegboard Test and the BEC96 questionnaire, respectively. A data-transformation method was applied to avoid ceiling effects, and single-case analysis was performed based on raw scores and completion time. All groups demonstrated either impaired or slowed tool use. Planning deficits were found only in the AD group. Mechanical problem-solving deficits were observed only in the AD and CBS groups. Performance in the Tower of London test was the best predictor of tool use skills in the AD group, suggesting these patients had general rather than mechanical problem-solving deficits. Episodic memory seemed to play little role in performance. Motor dysfunction tended to be associated with tool use skills in CBS patients, while tool use disorders are interpreted as a consequence of the semantic loss in SD in line with previous works. These findings may encourage caregivers to set up disease-centred interventions.",28455846,,10.1111/jnp.12121,5
Sirtuins and Their Implications in Neurodegenerative Diseases from a Drug Discovery Perspective,"Sirtuins are class III histone deacetylase (HDAC) enzymes that target both histone and non-histone substrates. They are linked to different brain functions and the regulation of different isoforms of these enzymes is touted to be an emerging therapy for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases (NDs), including Parkinson's disease (PD), Alzheimer's disease (AD), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). The level of sirtuins affects brain health as many sirtuin-regulated pathways are responsible for the progression of NDs. Certain sirtuins are also implicated in aging, which is a risk factor for many NDs. In addition to SIRT1-3, it has been suggested that the less studied sirtuins (SIRT4-7) also play critical roles in brain health. This review delineates the role of each sirtuin isoform in NDs from a disease centric perspective and provides an up-to-date overview of sirtuin modulators and their potential use as therapeutics in these diseases. Furthermore, the future perspectives for sirtuin modulator development and their therapeutic application in neurodegeneration are outlined in detail, hence providing a research direction for future studies.",33280374,,10.1021/acschemneuro.0c00696,14
Brain metabolism as a modulator of autophagy in neurodegeneration,"Emerging evidence that autophagy serves as a sweeper for toxic materials in the brain gives us new insight into the pathophysiology of neurodegenerative diseases. Autophagy is important for maintaining cellular homeostasis associated with metabolism. Some neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer׳s and Parkinson׳s diseases are accompanied by altered metabolism and autophagy in the brain. In this review, we discuss how hormones and nutrients regulate autophagy in the brain and affect neurodegeneration. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled SI:Autophagy.",26970520,,10.1016/j.brainres.2016.02.049,9
Differential effects of blood insulin and HbA1c on cerebral amyloid burden and neurodegeneration in nondiabetic cognitively normal older adults,"We tested the hypothesis that lower insulin or higher glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels in blood are associated with increased cerebral beta amyloid (Aβ) deposition and neurodegeneration in nondiabetic cognitively normal (CN) older adults. A total of 205 nondiabetic CN older adults underwent comprehensive clinical assessment, [11C]Pittsburgh compound B (PiB)-positron emission tomography (PET), [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose-PET, magnetic resonance imaging, and blood sampling for fasting insulin and HbA1c measurement. Lower blood insulin was significantly associated with increased Aβ positivity rates and decreased cerebral glucose metabolism in the AD-signature region. In contrast, higher HbA1c levels were not associated with Aβ positivity rates but were significantly associated with higher rates of having neurodegeneration in the AD-signature regions. Our results suggest different roles of insulin and HbA1c in AD pathogenesis, in that decreased blood insulin below optimal levels may contribute to increasing cerebral Aβ deposition and neurodegeneration whereas impaired glycemic control may aggravate neurodegeneration through a nonamyloid mechanism in nondiabetic CN older adults.",28780367,,10.1016/j.neurobiolaging.2017.07.004,14
Predicting conversion from MCI to AD by integration of rs-fMRI and clinical information using 3D-convolutional neural network,"Purpose:Alzheimer's is the most common irreversible neurodegenerative disease. Its symptoms range from memory impairments to degradation of multiple cognitive abilities and ultimately death. Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is the earliest detectable stage that happens between normal aging and early dementia, and even though MCI subjects have a chance of changing back to cognitively normal or even staying the same, there is a risk that their condition progresses to Alzheimer's disease (AD) annually. Therefore predicting AD among MCI subjects is pivotal for starting treatments at an opportune time in case of progression, and if staying stable is the case, the need for consistent medical observations would eliminate. Thus, we aim to diagnose possible conversion from MCI to AD by exploiting a class of deep learning (DL) methods called convolutional neural network (CNN).Methods:We proposed a three-dimensional CNN (3D-CNN) to combine and analyze resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI), clinical assessment results, and demographic information to predict conversion from MCI to AD in an average 5-years interval. Initially, a 3D-CNN was developed based on fMRI single volumes of 266 samples from 81 subjects; then, we used neuron layers to combine clinical data with fMRI to improve the results.Results:At first, the CNN model demonstrated an AUC of 87.67% and an accuracy of 85.7%, then after combining clinical and rs-fMRI features, we observed the following improved scores: an AUC of 91.72%, an accuracy of 87.6%, a sensitivity of 75.58% and a specificity of 92.57%.Conclusion:Our developed algorithm managed to predict prognosis from MCI to AD with high levels of accuracy, proving the potential of DL approaches in solving the matter and the efficiency of integrating clinical information with imaging according to the proposed method.",35419720,,10.1007/s11548-022-02620-4,3
Therapeutic strategies for the treatment of tauopathies: Hopes and challenges,"A group of neurodegenerative diseases referred to as tauopathies are characterized by the presence of brain cells harboring inclusions of pathological species of the tau protein. These disorders include Alzheimer's disease and frontotemporal lobar degeneration due to tau pathology, including progressive supranuclear palsy, corticobasal degeneration, and Pick's disease. Tau is normally a microtubule (MT)-associated protein that appears to play an important role in ensuring proper axonal transport, but in tauopathies tau becomes hyperphosphorylated and disengages from MTs, with consequent misfolding and deposition into inclusions that mainly affect neurons but also glia. A body of experimental evidence suggests that the development of tau inclusions leads to the neurodegeneration observed in tauopathies, and there is a growing interest in developing tau-directed therapeutic agents. The following review provides a summary of strategies under investigation for the potential treatment of tauopathies, highlighting both the promises and challenges associated with these various therapeutic approaches.",27751442,PMC5116305,10.1016/j.jalz.2016.06.006,48
Molecular Links Between Alzheimer's Disease and Gastrointestinal Microbiota: Emphasis on Helicobacter pylori Infection Involvement,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease and the main form of dementia, characterized by progressive cognitive decline and detrimental consequences in both personal-family and global level. Within this narrative review, we provide recent molecular aspects of Tau, a microtubule AD-associated protein, as well as amyloid beta, involved in AD pathophysiology. Moreover, we provide additional emerging data from basic research as well as clinical studies indicating an implicating role of gastrointestinal microbiota (GI-M), including Helicobacter pylori infection (Hp-I), in AD pathophysiology. Likewise, we identified through a molecular prism the current evidence of AD pathogenesis as well as its linkage with GI-M and emphasizing the role of Hp-I. All in all, additional large-scale studies are required for the further clarification of AD pathophysiology and its connection with GI-M and Hp-I, so as novel therapies on molecular basis become available.",31530263,,10.2174/1566524019666190917125917,5
Molecular mechanisms highlighting the potential role of COVID-19 in the development of neurodegenerative diseases,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a contagious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). In addition to the pulmonary manifestations, COVID-19 patients may present a wide range of neurological disorders as extrapulmonary presentations. In this view, several studies have recently documented the worsening of neurological symptoms within COVID-19 morbidity in patients previously diagnosed with neurodegenerative diseases (NDs). Moreover, several cases have also been reported in which the patients presented parkinsonian features after initial COVID-19 symptoms. These data raise a major concern about the possibility of communication between SARS-CoV-2 infection and the initiation and/or worsening of NDs. In this review, we have collected compelling evidence suggesting SARS-CoV-2, as an environmental factor, may be capable of developing NDs. In this respect, the possible links between SARS-CoV-2 infection and molecular pathways related to most NDs and the pathophysiological mechanisms of the NDs such as Alzheimer's disease, vascular dementia, frontotemporal dementia, Parkinson's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis will be explained.",35895572,,10.1556/2060.2022.00019,4
Blood-Brain Barrier and Neurovascular Unit In Vitro Models for Studying Mitochondria-Driven Molecular Mechanisms of Neurodegeneration,"Pathophysiology of chronic neurodegeneration is mainly based on complex mechanisms related to aberrant signal transduction, excitation/inhibition imbalance, excitotoxicity, synaptic dysfunction, oxidative stress, proteotoxicity and protein misfolding, local insulin resistance and metabolic dysfunction, excessive cell death, development of glia-supported neuroinflammation, and failure of neurogenesis. These mechanisms tightly associate with dramatic alterations in the structure and activity of the neurovascular unit (NVU) and the blood-brain barrier (BBB). NVU is an ensemble of brain cells (brain microvessel endothelial cells (BMECs), astrocytes, pericytes, neurons, and microglia) serving for the adjustment of cell-to-cell interactions, metabolic coupling, local microcirculation, and neuronal excitability to the actual needs of the brain. The part of the NVU known as a BBB controls selective access of endogenous and exogenous molecules to the brain tissue and efflux of metabolites to the blood, thereby providing maintenance of brain chemical homeostasis critical for efficient signal transduction and brain plasticity. In Alzheimer's disease, mitochondria are the target organelles for amyloid-induced neurodegeneration and alterations in NVU metabolic coupling or BBB breakdown. In this review we discuss understandings on mitochondria-driven NVU and BBB dysfunction, and how it might be studied in current and prospective NVU/BBB in vitro models for finding new approaches for the efficient pharmacotherapy of Alzheimer's disease.",33925080,PMC8125678,10.3390/ijms22094661,17
"COVID-19 and Alzheimer's Disease: Neuroinflammation, Oxidative Stress, Ferroptosis, and Mechanisms Involved","Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease characterized by marked cognitive decline, memory loss, and spatio-temporal troubles and, in severe cases, lack of recognition of family members. Neurological symptoms, cognitive disturbances, and the inflammatory frame due to COVID-19, together with long-term effects, have fueled renewed interest in AD based on similar damage. COVID-19 also caused the acceleration of AD symptom onset. In this regard, the morbidity and mortality of COVID-19 were reported to be increased in patients with AD due to multiple pathological changes such as excessive expression of the viral receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), comorbidities such as diabetes, hypertension, or drug-drug interactions in patients receiving polypharmacy and the high presence of proinflammatory molecules. Furthermore, the release of cytokines, neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, and ferroptosis in both diseases showed common underlying mechanisms, which together worsen the clinical picture and prognosis of these patients.",36200215,,10.2174/0929867329666221003101548,4
Emerging therapeutic developments in neurodegenerative diseases: A clinical investigation,"Despite a century of intensive research, there is still a lack of disease-modifying treatments for neurodegenerative diseases that pose a threat to human society. A well-documented knowledge and resource gap has impeded the translation of fundamental research into promising therapies. In addition, the analysis of extensive preclinical data to allow the improved selection of therapeutic technologies and clinical candidates for further development is challenging. To address this need, we describe technologies that have emerged over the past decade that have enabled the development of novel, high-quality, cost-effective treatments for major neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. Moreover, we benchmark emerging technologies that have been adopted by top pharmaceutical companies looking to bridge the gap between drug discovery and drug development in neurodegenerative disease.",35728774,,10.1016/j.drudis.2022.06.005,6
The Ubiquitin-Proteasome System and Molecular Chaperone Deregulation in Alzheimer's Disease,"One of the shared hallmarks of neurodegenerative diseases is the accumulation of misfolded proteins. Therefore, it is suspected that normal proteostasis is crucial for neuronal survival in the brain and that the malfunction of this mechanism may be the underlying cause of neurodegenerative diseases. The accumulation of amyloid plaques (APs) composed of amyloid-beta peptide (Aβ) aggregates and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) composed of misfolded Tau proteins are the defining pathological markers of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The accumulation of these proteins indicates a faulty protein quality control in the AD brain. An impaired ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) could lead to negative consequences for protein regulation, including loss of function. Another pivotal mechanism for the prevention of misfolded protein accumulation is the utilization of molecular chaperones. Molecular chaperones, such as heat shock proteins (HSPs) and FK506-binding proteins (FKBPs), are highly involved in protein regulation to ensure proper folding and normal function. In this review, we elaborate on the molecular basis of AD pathophysiology using recent data, with a particular focus on the role of the UPS and molecular chaperones as the defensive mechanism against misfolded proteins that have prion-like properties. In addition, we propose a rational therapy approach based on this mechanism.",25561438,,10.1007/s12035-014-9063-4,43
Using gamma-band transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) to improve sleep quality and cognition in patients with mild neurocognitive disorders due to Alzheimer's disease: A study protocol for a randomized controlled trial,"Background:Sleep disturbances are highly prevalent in patients with age-related neurodegenerative diseases, which severely affect cognition and even lead to accumulated β-amyloid. Encouraging results from recent studies on transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) showed moderate positive effects on sleep quality in preclinical Alzheimer's disease (AD). Compared to tDCS, transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) enables the entrainment of neuronal activity with optimized focality through injecting electric current with a specific frequency and has significant enhancement effects on slow wave activities.Methods and design:This is a randomized, double-blind, sham-controlled clinical trial comparing 40 Hz tACS with tDCS in mild neurocognitive disorders due to AD with sleep disturbances. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data is used to construct personalized realistic head model. Treatment outcomes, including sleep quality, cognitive performance and saliva Aβ levels will be conducted at baseline, 4th week, 8th week, 12th week and 24th week.Conclusions:It is expected that the repeated gamma-band tACS will show significant improvements in sleep quality and cognitive functions compared to tDCS and sham tDCS. The findings will provide high-level evidence and guide further advanced studies in the field of neurodegenerative diseases and sleep medicine.Trial registration:ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier:NCT05544201.",37540692,PMC10403094,10.1371/journal.pone.0289591,0
The role of microRNAs in the pathophysiology of human central nervous system: A focus on neurodegenerative diseases,"microRNAs (miRNAs) are suggested to play substantial roles in regulating the development and various physiologic functions of the central nervous system (CNS). These include neurogenesis, cell fate and differentiation, morphogenesis, formation of dendrites, and targeting non-neural mRNAs. Notably, deregulation of an increasing number of miRNAs is associated with several neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and CNS tumors. They are particularly known to affect the amyloid β (Aβ) cleavage and accumulation, tau protein homeostasis, and expression of alpha-synuclein (α-syn), Parkin, PINK1, and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) that play pivotal roles in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases. These include miR-16, miR-17-5p, miR-20a, miR-106a, miR-106b, miR-15a, miR-15b, miR-103, miR-107, miR-298, miR-328, miR-195, miR-485, and miR-29. In CNS tumors, several miRNAs, including miR-31, miR-16, and miR-21 have been identified to modulate tumorigenesis through impacting tumor invasion and apoptosis. In this review article, we have a look at the recent advances on our knowledge about the role of miRNAs in human brain development and functions, neurodegenerative diseases, and their clinical potentials.",37832609,,10.1016/j.arr.2023.102090,9
Roles of Cannabidiol in the Treatment and Prevention of Alzheimer's Disease by Multi-target Actions,"Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is one of the most common neurodegenerative diseases with chronic, progressive, and irreversible characteristics, affecting nearly 50 million older adults worldwide. The pathogenesis of AD includes the formation of senile plaques, the abnormal aggregation of tau protein and the gradual degeneration and death of cerebral cortical cells. The main symptoms are memory loss, cognitive decline and behavioral disorders. Studies indicate that cannabidiol (CBD) possesses various pharmacological activities, including anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidation and neuroprotective activities. It has been suggested as a potential multi-target medicine for the treatment of AD. In this review, we aim to summarize the underlying mechanisms and protective effects of CBD on signaling pathways and central receptors involved in the pathogenesis of AD, including the endocannabinoid system (eCBs), the Transient receptor potential vanilloid type 1(TRPV1) receptor, and the Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptor (PPAR) receptor.",33797364,,10.2174/1389557521666210331162857,4
Pathogenic Potential of Eomesodermin-Expressing T-Helper Cells in Neurodegenerative Diseases,"Eomesodermin-expressing (Eomes+) T-helper (Th) cells show cytotoxic characteristics in secondary progressive multiple sclerosis. We found that Eomes+Th cell frequency was increased in the peripheral blood of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and Alzheimer's disease patients. Furthermore, granzyme B production by Th cells from such patients was high compared with controls. A high frequency of Eomes+Th cells was observed in the initial (acutely progressive) stage of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and a positive correlation between Eomes+Th cell frequency and cognitive decline was observed in Alzheimer's disease patients. Therefore, Eomes+Th cells may be involved in the pathology of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and Alzheimer's disease. ANN NEUROL 2024;95:1093-1098.",38516846,,10.1002/ana.26920,0
Neuroinflammation in Alzheimer's Disease: Current Progress in Molecular Signaling and Therapeutics,"Alzheimer's disease, a neurodegenerative disease with amyloid beta accumulation as a major hallmark, has become a dire global health concern as there is a lack of clear understanding of the causative agent. It is a major cause of dementia which is increasing exponentially with age. Alzheimer's disease is marked by tau hyperphosphorylation and amyloid beta accumulation that robs people of their memories. Amyloid beta deposition initiated a spectrum of microglia-activated neuroinflammation, and microglia and astrocyte activation elicited expressions of various inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines. Neuroinflammation is one of the cardinal features of Alzheimer's disease. Pro-inflammatory cytokine signaling plays multifarious roles in neurodegeneration and neuroprotection. Induction of proinflammatory signaling leads to discharge of immune mediators which affect functions of neurons and cause cell death. Sluggish anti-inflammatory system also contributes to neuroinflammation. Numerous pathways like NFκB, p38 MAPK, Akt/mTOR, caspase, nitric oxide, and COX are involved in triggering brain immune cells like astrocytes and microglia to secrete inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor, interleukins, and chemokines and participate in Alzheimer's disease pathology. PPAR-γ agonists tend to boost the phagocytosis of amyloid beta and decrease the inflammatory cytokine IL-1β. Recent findings suggest the cross-link between gut microbiota and neuroinflammation contributing in AD which has been explained in this study. The role of cellular, molecular pathways and involvement of inflammatory mediators in neuroinflammation has also been described; targeting them could be a potential therapeutic strategy for treatment of AD.",35986874,,10.1007/s10753-022-01721-1,46
Ratio Aβ1-42:p-Tau: a Possible Diagnostic Tool in Differentiating Dementias,"Background:Patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) present a typical biochemical profile of biomarkers: low concentration of β amyloid 1-42 (Aβ1-42), high concentration of total Tau (t-Tau) and phosphorylated Tau at threonine 181 (p-Tau). Several neurodegenerative diseases may overlap with AD, both in regards to clinical symptoms and neuropathology. Many data suggest that Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathophysiology can be identified using biomarkers. It has been hypothesized that subjects with dementia due to AD showed low levels of Aβ1-42 combined with the highest levels of total Tau and phosphorylated Tau; moreover, it has been hypothesized that the ratio Aβ1-42:p-Tau further help in discriminating Alzheimer's disease from other diagnoses. The aim of this work is to verify this hypothesis in our cohort of patients and to investigate if the same ratio could be a sensitive index able to discriminate MCI due to neurodegenerative factors (MCId) from MCI due to vascular factors (MCIv).Methods:Two hundred sixty-two patients meeting the NIA-AA and NINDS-AIREN criteria were diagnosed as follow: AD in 120 patients [mean age 71.6 (42 - 87)], FTD in 23 patients [mean age 67.3 (46 - 78)], LBD in 17 patients [mean age 73.2 (58 - 83)], VAD in 9 patients [mean age 71.2 (60 - 81)]. According to the criteria proposed by Petersen RC, 24 patients had the diagnosis of MCId [mean age 71.8 (59 - 81)], 38 MCIv [mean age 69.3 (55-82). The comparison between the ratio of Aβ1-42/p-Tau among the six groups was done using t-test for independent samples. A p-value < 0.05 was considered to represent statistical significance. The ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic) curve analysis was made using R-studio software.Results:The ratio Aβ1-42:p-Tau was significantly lower in AD and MCId with respect to all the other groups and the difference was also statistically significant between MCId and MCIv.Conclusions:Aβ1-42:p-Tau ratio has potential for being implemented in the clinical routine for differential diagnosis between AD and other dementias and to distinguish underling pathology such as neurodegenerative or vascular disease.",31115229,,10.7754/Clin.Lab.2018.181019,0
"Pathogenesis, Animal Models, and Drug Discovery of Alzheimer's Disease","Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common cause of dementia, is a chronic neurodegenerative disease induced by multiple factors. The high incidence and the aging of the global population make it a growing global health concern with huge implications for individuals and society. The clinical manifestations are progressive cognitive dysfunction and lack of behavioral ability, which not only seriously affect the health and quality of life of the elderly, but also bring a heavy burden to the family and society. Unfortunately, almost all the drugs targeting the classical pathogenesis have not achieved satisfactory clinical effects in the past two decades. Therefore, the present review provides more novel ideas on the complex pathophysiological mechanisms of AD, including classical pathogenesis and a variety of possible pathogenesis that have been proposed in recent years. It will be helpful to find out the key target and the effect pathway of potential drugs and mechanisms for the prevention and treatment of AD. In addition, the common animal models in AD research are outlined and we examine their prospect for the future. Finally, Phase I, II, III, and IV randomized clinical trials or on the market of drugs for AD treatment were searched in online databases (Drug Bank Online 5.0, the U.S. National Library of Medicine, and Alzforum). Therefore, this review may also provide useful information in the research and development of new AD-based drugs.",37424469,,10.3233/JAD-230326,2
Low-Level Laser Therapy to the Bone Marrow Ameliorates Neurodegenerative Disease Progression in a Mouse Model of Alzheimer's Disease: A Minireview,"Objective:This communication reviews the ability of low-level laser therapy (LLLT) to stimulate mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) in autologous bone marrow (BM) to enhance the capacity of MSCs to infiltrate the brain, clear β-amyloid, and improve cognition.Background:We recently reported that LLLT applied to the BM enhanced the proliferation of MSCs and their mobilization toward the ischemic heart region, suggesting a possible application of this approach in regenerative medicine and neurodegenerative diseases. It was also shown that circulating monocytes can infiltrate the brain and reduce brain amyloid load in an Alzheimer's disease (AD) mouse model.Methods and results:MSCs from wild-type mice stimulated with LLLT demonstrated an increased ability to maturate toward a monocyte lineage and to increase phagocytosis of soluble Aβ in vitro. Furthermore, weekly LLLT for 2 months to the BM, starting at 4 months of age (progressive stage of the disease in these 5XFAD transgenic male mice), improved memory and spatial learning, compared to a sham-treated AD mouse model. Histology revealed a significant reduction in Aβ brain burden in the laser-treated mice compared to the nonlaser-treated ones.Conclusions:The application of LLLT to the BM is suggested as a therapeutic approach in progressive stages of AD, and its potential role in mediating MSC therapy in brain amyloidogenic disease is implied.",27294393,,10.1089/pho.2015.4072,22
MicroRNAs as a New Target for Alzheimer's Disease Treatment,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common progressive neurodegenerative disease associated with advanced age. It is characterized by cognitive decline and memory loss and accounts for most cases of dementia in older people. AD can be rooted in genetic, epigenetic, or environmental causes. No drugs or other therapeutic agents prevent or delay AD progression. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short and uncoded RNAs that can bind to 200 RNAs approximately. By inhibiting or destroying specific messenger RNAs (mRNAs), they control gene expression and broadly affect cellular functions. MiRNAs play important roles in regulating neuronal growth, neuronal differentiation, dendritic spine morphology, and synaptic flexibility in the nervous system. The expression levels of miRNAs are changed in neurological diseases, including AD, suggesting that they play an essential role in the pathogenesis of the disease. Therefore, targeting disrupted miRNAs may be a novel therapeutic approach against AD and offers multiple solutions, including harnessing the beneficial effects of beta-amyloid, reducing tau protein, reducing neuronal cell death, and protecting synapses in AD.",36173083,,10.2174/2211536611666220928154015,2
Substance abuse and neurodegenerative diseases: focus on ferroptosis,"Psychostimulants and alcohol are widely abused substances with the adverse effects on global public health. Substance abuse seriously harms people's health and causes various diseases, especially neurodegenerative diseases. Neurodegenerative diseases include Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). The pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases is complex and diverse, usually involving oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, metal homeostasis disorder, and neuro-inflammation. The precise molecular mechanisms underlying neurodegeneration remain unclear, which is a major obstacle to therapeutic approaches. Therefore, it is urgent to improve the understanding of the molecular mechanisms of neurodegenerative processes and to identify the therapeutic targets for treatment and prevention. Ferroptosis is a regulatory cell necrosis caused by iron ion catalysis and lipid peroxidation induced by reactive oxygen species (ROS), which is thought to be associated with nervous system diseases, particularly neurodegenerative diseases. This review overviewed the ferroptosis process and explored the relationship of ferroptosis with substance abuse and neurodegenerative diseases, which provides a new way to study the molecular mechanisms of neurodegenerative diseases induced by alcohol, cocaine, and methamphetamine (MA), and also provides the potential therapeutic targets for substance abuse-induced neurodegenerative diseases.",37100932,,10.1007/s00204-023-03505-4,3
Current understanding of the Alzheimer's disease-associated microbiome and therapeutic strategies,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a fatal progressive neurodegenerative disease. Despite tremendous research efforts to understand this complex disease, the exact pathophysiology of the disease is not completely clear. Recently, anti-Aβ antibodies have been shown to remove amyloid from the brain and slow the clinical progression of mild dementia by ~30%. However, exploring alternative strategies is crucial to understanding and developing more effective therapeutic interventions. In recent years, the microbiota-gut-brain axis has received significant attention in the AD field. Numerous studies have suggested that alterations in the gut microbiota composition are associated with the progression of AD, and several underlying mechanisms have been proposed. However, studies in this area are still in their infancy, and many aspects of this field are just beginning to be explored and understood. Gaining a deeper understanding of the intricate interactions and signaling pathways involved in the microbiota-AD interaction is crucial for optimizing therapeutic strategies targeting gut microbiota to positively impact AD. In this review, we aim to summarize the current understanding of the microbiota-gut-brain axis in AD. We will discuss the existing evidence regarding the role of gut microbiota in AD pathogenesis, suggested underlying mechanisms, biological factors influencing the microbiome-gut-brain axis in AD, and remaining questions in the field. Last, we will discuss potential therapeutic approaches to recondition the community of gut microbiota to alleviate disease progression. An ongoing exploration of the gut-brain axis and the development of microbiota-based therapies hold the potential for advancing AD management in the future.",38172602,PMC10834451,10.1038/s12276-023-01146-2,1
Surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy of tears: toward a diagnostic tool for neurodegenerative disease identification,"Significance:A noninvasive method based on surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) of tears was proposed as a support for diagnosing neurodegenerative pathologies, including different forms of dementia and Alzheimer's disease (AD). In this field, timely and reliable discrimination and diagnosis are critical aspects for choosing a valid medical therapy, and new methods are highly required.Aim:The aim is to evince spectral differences in SERS response of human tears from AD affected, mild cognitive impaired (MCI), and healthy control (Ctr) subjects.Approach:Human tears were characterized by SERS coupled with multivariate data analysis. Thirty-one informed subjects (Ctr, MCI, and AD) were considered.Results:Average SERS spectra from Ctr, MCI, and AD subjects evidenced differences related to lactoferrin and lysozyme protein components. Quantitative changes were also observed by determining the intensity ratio between selected bands. We also constructed a classification model that discriminated among AD, MCI, and Ctr subjects. The model was built using the scores obtained by performing principal component analysis on specific spectral regions (i-PCA).Conclusions:The results are very encouraging with interesting perspectives for medical applications as support of clinical diagnosis and discrimination of AD from other forms of dementia.",32767890,PMC7406892,10.1117/1.JBO.25.8.087002,13
Locus coeruleus integrity is related to tau burden and memory loss in autosomal-dominant Alzheimer's disease,"Abnormally phosphorylated tau, an indicator of Alzheimer's disease, accumulates in the first decades of life in the locus coeruleus (LC), the brain's main noradrenaline supply. However, technical challenges in in-vivo assessments have impeded research into the role of the LC in Alzheimer's disease. We studied participants with or known to be at-risk for mutations in genes causing autosomal-dominant Alzheimer's disease (ADAD) with early onset, providing a unique window into the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's largely disentangled from age-related factors. Using high-resolution MRI and tau PET, we found lower rostral LC integrity in symptomatic participants. LC integrity was associated with individual differences in tau burden and memory decline. Post-mortem analyses in a separate set of carriers of the same mutation confirmed substantial neuronal loss in the LC. Our findings link LC degeneration to tau burden and memory in Alzheimer's, and highlight a role of the noradrenergic system in this neurodegenerative disease.",35045380,PMC8976827,10.1016/j.neurobiolaging.2021.11.006,38
Healthy Food Pyramid as Well as Physical and Mental Activity in the Prevention of Alzheimer's Disease,"The ageing of the population is resulting in neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), which are an increasing social, economic and medical problem. Diet and physical activity are now considered as important modifiable factors that help prevent or delay the development of AD and other dementia-related diseases. The pyramid of healthy nutrition and lifestyle is a way of presenting the principles, the implementation of which gives a chance for proper development and a long healthy life. The basis of the pyramid, in the first place, is physical activity. Our review of the literature in the PubMed database supports the hypothesis that complementary factors, such as proper diet, physical exercise and mental activity, have a positive impact on the prevention of neurodegenerative diseases. The nutritional recommendations for healthy adults primarily include the consumption of vegetables, fruits, cereals, legumes, vegetable oils and fishes. Therefore, the introduction of Mediterranean and Asian diets may reduce the risk of the neurodegenerative diseases associated with dementia, whereas dairy products and meat-the main sources of L-carnitine-should be consumed in moderate amounts. The aim of our work is to provide up-to-date knowledge about the appropriate dietary model and healthy lifestyle elements and their impact on good health and the long life of people.",35458096,PMC9028231,10.3390/nu14081534,6
"The Immune System and Neuroinflammation as Potential Sources of Blood-Based Biomarkers for Alzheimer's Disease, Parkinson's Disease, and Huntington's Disease","Neurodegenerative diseases are characterized by a loss of neurons that leads to cognitive and behavioral dysfunction. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disorder affecting millions of people in the United States and worldwide, followed by Parkinson's disease (PD). While some early onset forms of AD and PD are hereditary, the sporadic or late-onset cases are believed to result from lifestyle and environmental factors. On the contrary, Huntington's disease (HD) is a neurodegenerative disease solely caused by mutations in the gene for huntingtin protein. The disease mechanisms at play for all three disorders remain elusive, hampering efforts to develop effective therapeutic interventions. In light of this, the discovery of robust biomarkers is crucial in order to identify people at risk for AD and PD, preferably before symptoms arise. For all three diseases, the identification of biomarkers would not only allow development of treatments but also evaluation and adjustment of these with disease progression. It is now understood that neuroinflammation plays a crucial role in neurodegenerative diseases, along with subsequent immune activation. Therefore, research is actively ongoing to discover and evaluate inflammatory and immune-related biomarkers. Recent progress in this area for AD, PD, and HD is presented here.",27046268,,10.1021/acschemneuro.6b00042,28
Fractal Analysis in Neurodegenerative Diseases,"Neurodegenerative diseases are defined by progressive nervous system dysfunction and death of neurons. The abnormal conformation and assembly of proteins is suggested to be the most probable cause for many of these neurodegenerative disorders, leading to the accumulation of abnormally aggregated proteins, for example, amyloid β (Aβ) (Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia), tau protein (Alzheimer's disease and frontotemporal lobar degeneration), α-synuclein (Parkinson's disease and Lewy body dementia), polyglutamine expansion diseases (Huntington disease), or prion proteins (Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease). An aberrant gain-of-function mechanism toward excessive intraparenchymal accumulation thus represents a common pathogenic denominator in all these proteinopathies. Moreover, depending upon the predominant brain area involvement, these different neurodegenerative diseases lead to either movement disorders or dementia syndromes, although the underlying mechanism(s) can sometimes be very similar, and on other occasions, clinically similar syndromes can have quite distinct pathologies. Non-Euclidean image analysis approaches such as fractal dimension (FD) analysis have been applied extensively in quantifying highly variable morphopathological patterns, as well as many other connected biological processes; however, their application to understand and link abnormal proteinaceous depositions to other clinical and pathological features composing these syndromes is yet to be clarified. Thus, this short review aims to present the most important applications of FD in investigating the clinical-pathological spectrum of neurodegenerative diseases.",38468042,,10.1007/978-3-031-47606-8_18,0
The Alzheimer's disease drug development landscape,"Background:Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a devastating neurodegenerative disease leading to dementia. The field has made significant progress over the last 15 years. AD diagnosis has shifted from syndromal, based on signs and symptoms, to a biomarker construct based on the pathological hallmarks of the disease: amyloid β deposition, pathologic tau, and neurodegeneration. Numerous genetic risk factors for sporadic AD have been identified, providing further insight into the molecular underpinnings of the disease. For the last two decades, however, drug development for AD has been proven to be particularly challenging. Here, we provide a unique overview of the drug development landscape for AD. By comparing preclinical and clinical drug development pipelines, we aim to describe trends and differences regarding target classes and therapeutic modalities in preclinical and clinical development.Methods:We analyzed proprietary and public databases and company websites for drugs in preclinical development for AD by the pharmaceutical industry and major clinical trial registries for drugs in clinical development for AD. Drugs were categorized by target class and treatment modality.Results:We found a higher proportion of preclinical interventions targeting molecular pathways associated with sporadic AD genetic risk variants, compared to clinical stage interventions. These include apolipoprotein E (ApoE) and lipids, lysosomal/endosomal targets, and proteostasis. Further, we observed a trend suggesting that more traditional therapeutic modalities are developed for these novel targets, while more novel treatment modalities such as gene therapies and enzyme treatments are in development for more traditional targets such as amyloid β and tau. Interestingly, the percentage of amyloid β targeting therapies in preclinical development (19.2%) is even higher than the percentage in clinical development (10.7%), indicating that diversification away from interventions targeting amyloid-beta has not materialized. Inflammation is the second most popular target class in both preclinical and clinical development.Conclusions:Our observations show that the AD drug development pipeline is diversifying in terms of targets and treatment modalities, while amyloid-targeting therapies remain a prominent avenue of development as well. To further advance AD drug development, novel companion diagnostics are needed that are directed at disease mechanisms related to genetic risk factors of AD, both for patient stratification and assessment of therapeutic efficacy in clinical trials.",34763720,PMC8582156,10.1186/s13195-021-00927-z,39
Beyond Vision: A View from Eye to Alzheimer's Disease and Dementia,"With the aging of the global population, the health care burden of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and dementia is considered to increase dramatically in the coming decades. Given the insufficiency of effective interventions for AD and dementia, clinical research on identifying potentially modifiable risk factors and early diagnostic biomarkers becomes a public health priority. Currently, extracerebral manifestations with a large proportion of ocular involvement are usually recognized to precede the symptoms of AD and dementia. Growing epidemiologic evidence also suggests that eye disorders, such as cataracts, age-related macular degeneration, glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy, and so on, are closely associated with and even have a higher incidence of AD and dementia. The eye, as an extension of the central nervous system, therefore has the potential to provide a feasible approach to detecting structural and functional abnormalities of the brain. Numerous new imaging modalities are developed and give novel insights into the detection of several neurodegenerative, vascular, neuropathological, and other ocular abnormalities of AD and dementia in scientific research and clinical application. This review provides an overview of the epidemiologic associations between eye disorders and AD or dementia and summarizes the recent advances in ocular examinations and techniques employed for the detection of AD and dementia. With more brain-and-eye interconnections being identified, the eye is becoming a noninvasive and easily accessible window for the early diagnosis and prevention of AD and dementia.",38374754,,10.14283/jpad.2023.118,0
Design and first baseline data of the DZNE multicenter observational study on predementia Alzheimer's disease (DELCODE),"Background:Deep phenotyping and longitudinal assessment of predementia at-risk states of Alzheimer's disease (AD) are required to define populations and outcomes for dementia prevention trials. Subjective cognitive decline (SCD) is a pre-mild cognitive impairment (pre-MCI) at-risk state of dementia, which emerges as a highly promising target for AD prevention.Methods:The German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases (DZNE) is conducting the multicenter DZNE-Longitudinal Cognitive Impairment and Dementia Study (DELCODE), which focuses on the characterization of SCD in patients recruited from memory clinics. In addition, individuals with amnestic MCI, mild Alzheimer's dementia patients, first-degree relatives of patients with Alzheimer's dementia, and cognitively unimpaired control subjects are studied. The total number of subjects to be enrolled is 1000. Participants receive extensive clinical and neuropsychological assessments, magnetic resonance imaging, positron emission tomography, and biomaterial collection is perfomed. In this publication, we report cognitive and clinical data as well as apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotype and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarker results of the first 394 baseline data sets.Results:In comparison with the control group, patients with SCD showed slightly poorer performance on cognitive and functional measures (Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-cognitive part, Clinical Dementia Rating, Functional Activities Questionnaire), with all mean scores in a range which would be considered unimpaired. APOE4 genotype was enriched in the SCD group in comparison to what would be expected in the population and the frequency was significantly higher in comparison to the control group. CSF Aβ42 was lower in the SCD group in comparison to the control group at a statistical trend with age as a covariate. There were no group differences in Tau or pTau concentrations between the SCD and the control groups. The differences in all measures between the MCI group and the AD group were as expected.Conclusions:The initial baseline data for DELCODE support the approach of using SCD in patients recruited through memory clinics as an enrichment strategy for late-stage preclinical AD. This is indicated by slightly lower performance in a range of measures in SCD in comparison to the control subjects as well as by enriched APOE4 frequency and lower CSF Aβ42 concentration.Trial registration:German Clinical Trials Register DRKS00007966 .

The clinical approach to the identification of higher-order visual dysfunction in neurodegenerative disease,"Purpose of review:This review is intended to assist the reader in gaining the knowledge and skills necessary for the recognition and assessment of higher-order visual dysfunction due to neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's disease, dementia with Lewy bodies, Parkinson's dementia, corticobasal degeneration, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, and the posterior cortical atrophy syndrome. Clinical problem-solving and pattern recognition must be developed and practiced to accurately diagnosis disturbances of higher-order visual function, and knowledge of higher-order visual brain regions and their visual syndromes forms the foundation for deciphering symptoms presented by patients and/or their care partners. Tests of higher-order visual dysfunction must be assembled by the clinician and assessment can take time and effort. The use of screening tests, follow-up visits, and formal neuropsychological referrals are critical components for accurate diagnosis and these principles are reviewed here.Recent findings:A recent survey of neuro-ophthalmologists revealed that over half of the respondents report that 5-10% of their new patient referrals carry a diagnosis of neurodegenerative disease and many patients were referred for visual symptoms of unknown cause. Despite over a century of discovery related to higher-order visual functions of the human brain, translation of discovery to the clinical assessment of patients has been slow or absent. As with the approach to translational medicine in general, to see meaningful progress, an interdisciplinary approach is indispensable. The first step involves the application of discoveries from the field visual neuroscience by clinicians from the fields of ophthalmology, neurology, and neuropsychology, and from the disciplines of neuro-ophthalmology and behavioral neurology. The unmet need for recognition, assessment, and management of higher-order visual dysfunction in neurodegeneration is evident and clinicians can contribute to closing the gap by using the approach and the tools outlined in the review.",35320467,,10.1007/s11910-022-01186-7,1
The pathogenic role of the inflammasome in neurodegenerative diseases,"The inflammasome is a large macromolecular complex that contains multiple copies of a receptor or sensor of pathogen-derived or damage-derived molecular patterns, pro-caspase-1, and an adaptor called ASC (apoptotic speck containing protein with a CARD), which results in caspase-1 maturation. Caspase-1 then mediates the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1β and IL-18. These cytokines play critical roles in mediating immune responses during inflammation and innate immunity. Broader studies of the inflammasome over the years have implicated their roles in the pathogenesis of a variety of inflammatory diseases. Recently, studies have shown that the inflammasome modulates neuroinflammatory cells and the initial stages of neuroinflammation. A secondary cascade of events associated with neuroinflammation (such as oxidative stress) has been shown to activate the inflammasome, making the inflammasome a promising therapeutic target in the modulation of neurodegenerative diseases. This review will focus on the pathogenic role that inflammasomes play in neurologic diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, traumatic brain injury, and multiple sclerosis. We here review the role of the inflammasome in the pathogenesis of traumatic brain injury (TBI). TBI is initiated by physical force exerted to head, resulting in neuronal injury and death. Primary insult is followed by a secondary cascade of events following neuroinflammation such as mitochondrial dysfunction, production of reactive oxygen species, potassium effluxes, and release of circulating DNA. These events can potentially trigger the activation of NLRP3, NLRP1, and AIM2 during TBI but have yet to be confirmed (dashed lines). NLRP3, NLRP1, and AIM2 associate with the adaptor protein ASC, which initiates the cleavage of pro-caspase-1 to the mature form of caspase-1 which cleaves pro-IL-1β and pro-IL-18 into their mature forms of IL-1β and IL-18.",26119245,,10.1111/jnc.13217,143
Neurodegenerative disorders: From clinicopathology convergence to systems biology divergence,"Neurodegenerative diseases are multifactorial. This means that several genetic, epigenetic, and environmental factors contribute to their emergence. Therefore, for the future management of these highly prevalent diseases, it is necessary to change perspective. If a holistic viewpoint is assumed, the phenotype (the clinicopathological convergence) emerges from the perturbation of a complex system of functional interactions among proteins (systems biology divergence). The systems biology top-down approach starts with the unbiased collection of sets of data generated through one or more -omics techniques and has the aim to identify the networks and the components that participate in the generation of a phenotype (disease), often without any available a priori knowledge. The principle behind the top-down method is that the molecular components that respond similarly to experimental perturbations are somehow functionally related. This allows the study of complex and relatively poorly characterized diseases without requiring extensive knowledge of the processes under investigation. In this chapter, the use of a global approach will be applied to the comprehension of neurodegeneration, with a particular focus on the two most prevalent ones, Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. The final purpose is to distinguish disease subtypes (even with similar clinical manifestations) to launch a future of precision medicine for patients with these disorders.",36796949,,10.1016/B978-0-323-85538-9.00007-9,1
The Use of18F-FDG PET in the Diagnostic Workup of Alzheimer's Dementia,"The diagnosis of dementia probably due to Alzheimer's disease is still primarily a clinical one. In cases that remain clinically unclear, however, biomarkers for amyloid deposition and neuronal injury can help to identify the underlying cause. One biomarker even for early neuronal injury in the stage of mild cognitive impairment is cerebral glucose hypometabolism measured by18F-FDG PET. Distinct patterns of hypometabolism can be seen, for example, in dementia due to Alzheimer's disease, frontotemporal lobar degeneration, and dementia with Lewy bodies. This makes it possible to distinguish between different neurodegenerative diseases as well as major depressive disorder. While the sensitivity of18F-FDG PET to detect Alzheimer's disease is high, specificity is low and the additional use of biomarkers for amyloid deposition might be beneficial in some cases. In conclusion,18F-FDG PET is a useful tool when the cause for dementia remains unclear and different diagnosis would lead to different treatment approaches. Due to the lack of treatment options in pre-dementia stages, the use of18F-FDG PET is currently not recommended for these cases in a purely clinical setting.",29512075,,10.1007/978-1-4939-7704-8_14,1
A Bird's-Eye View of the Multiple Biochemical Mechanisms that Propel Pathology of Alzheimer's Disease: Recent Advances and Mechanistic Perspectives on How to Halt the Disease Progression Targeting Multiple Pathways,"Neurons consume the highest amount of oxygen, depend on oxidative metabolism for energy, and survive for the lifetime of an individual. Therefore, neurons are vulnerable to death caused by oxidative-stress, accumulation of damaged and dysfunctional proteins and organelles. There is an exponential increase in the number of patients diagnosed with neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's (AD) as the number of elderly increases exponentially. Development of AD pathology is a complex phenomenon characterized by neuronal death, accumulation of extracellular amyloid-β plaques and neurofibrillary tangles, and most importantly loss of memory and cognition. These pathologies are most likely caused by mechanisms including oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction/stress, accumulation of misfolded proteins, and defective organelles due to impaired proteasome and autophagy mechanisms. Currently, there are no effective treatments to halt the progression of this disease. In order to treat this complex disease with multiple biochemical pathways involved, a complex treatment regimen targeting different mechanisms should be investigated. Furthermore, as AD is a progressive disease-causing morbidity over many years, any chemo-modulator for treatment must be used over long period of time. Therefore, treatments must be safe and non-interfering with other processes. Ideally, a treatment like medicinal food or a supplement that can be taken regularly without any side effect capable of reducing oxidative stress, stabilizing mitochondria, activating autophagy or proteasome, and increasing energy levels of neurons would be the best solution. This review summarizes progress in research on different mechanisms of AD development and some of the potential therapeutic development strategies targeting the aforementioned pathologies.",31127770,PMC6598003,10.3233/JAD-181230,8
Unified voxel- and tensor-based morphometry (UVTBM) using registration confidence,"Voxel-based morphometry (VBM) and tensor-based morphometry (TBM) both rely on spatial normalization to a template and yet have different requirements for the level of registration accuracy. VBM requires only global alignment of brain structures, with limited degrees of freedom in transformation, whereas TBM performs best when the registration is highly deformable and can achieve higher registration accuracy. In addition, the registration accuracy varies over the whole brain, with higher accuracy typically observed in subcortical areas and lower accuracy seen in cortical areas. Hence, even the determinant of Jacobian of registration maps is spatially varying in their accuracy, and combining these with VBM by direct multiplication introduces errors in VBM maps where the registration is inaccurate. We propose a unified approach to combining these 2 morphometry methods that is motivated by these differing requirements for registration and our interest in harnessing the advantages of both. Our novel method uses local estimates of registration confidence to determine how to weight the influence of VBM- and TBM-like approaches. Results are shown on healthy and mild Alzheimer's subjects (N = 150) investigating age and group differences, and potential of differential diagnosis is shown on a set of Alzheimer's disease (N = 34) and frontotemporal dementia (N = 30) patients compared against controls (N = 14). These show that the group differences detected by our proposed approach are more descriptive than those detected from VBM, Jacobian-modulated VBM, and TBM separately, hence leveraging the advantages of both approaches in a unified framework.",25264347,PMC8026273,10.1016/j.neurobiolaging.2014.04.036,9
Tau pathology and cognitive reserve in Alzheimer's disease,"Cognitive reserve (CR) is defined as the ability to maintain functionality despite accumulating pathology. Education has been used as a proxy for CR. For example, by using positron emission tomography imaging, higher educated Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients presented increased amyloid β pathology than lower educated patients despite equal symptomatology. Whether similar associations exist for in vivo tau pathology remains elusive. We utilized [18F]AV-1451 positron emission tomography imaging to examine whether high-educated AD patients (n = 12) present more severe tau pathology compared with low-educated patients (n = 12) despite equal clinical severity in regions of interest corresponding to the pathologic disease stages defined by Braak & Braak. We report tau pathology in advanced Braak stages associated with parietal and frontal regions in high-educated AD patients, whereas in low-educated AD patients tau accumulation is still confined to lower Braak stages associated with temporal and cingulate regions. Highly educated AD patients seem to be able to tolerate more tau tangle pathology than lower educated patients with comparable cognitive impairment supporting the cognitive reserve hypothesis.",28577411,,10.1016/j.neurobiolaging.2017.05.004,28
Microglial Progranulin: Involvement in Alzheimer's Disease and Neurodegenerative Diseases,"Neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease have proven resistant to new treatments. The complexity of neurodegenerative disease mechanisms can be highlighted by accumulating evidence for a role for a growth factor, progranulin (PGRN). PGRN is a glycoprotein encoded by the GRN/Grn gene with multiple cellular functions, including neurotrophic, anti-inflammatory and lysosome regulatory properties. Mutations in the GRN gene can lead to frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD), a cause of dementia, and neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (NCL), a lysosomal storage disease. Both diseases are associated with loss of PGRN function resulting, amongst other features, in enhanced microglial neuroinflammation and lysosomal dysfunction. PGRN has also been implicated in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Unlike FTLD, increased expression of PGRN occurs in brains of human AD cases and AD model mice, particularly in activated microglia. How microglial PGRN might be involved in AD and other neurodegenerative diseases will be discussed. A unifying feature of PGRN in diseases might be its modulation of lysosomal function in neurons and microglia. Many experimental models have focused on consequences of PGRN gene deletion: however, possible outcomes of increasing PGRN on microglial inflammation and neurodegeneration will be discussed. We will also suggest directions for future studies on PGRN and microglia in relation to neurodegenerative diseases.",30862089,PMC6468562,10.3390/cells8030230,33
Magnetic resonance imaging and positron emission tomography in the diagnosis of neurodegenerative dementias,"Neuroimaging, both with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and positron emission tomography (PET), has gained a pivotal role in the diagnosis of primary neurodegenerative diseases. These two techniques are used as biomarkers of both pathology and progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and to differentiate AD from other neurodegenerative diseases. MRI is able to identify structural changes including patterns of atrophy characterizing neurodegenerative diseases, and to distinguish these from other causes of cognitive impairment, e.g. infarcts, space-occupying lesions and hydrocephalus. PET is widely used to identify regional patterns of glucose utilization, since distinct patterns of distribution of cerebral glucose metabolism are related to different subtypes of neurodegenerative dementia. The use of PET in mild cognitive impairment, though controversial, is deemed helpful for predicting conversion to dementia and the dementia clinical subtype. Recently, new radiopharmaceuticals for the in vivo imaging of amyloid burden have been licensed and more tracers are being developed for the assessment of tauopathies and inflammatory processes, which may underlie the onset of the amyloid cascade. At present, the cerebral amyloid burden, imaged with PET, may help to exclude the presence of AD as well as forecast its possible onset. Finally PET imaging may be particularly useful in ongoing clinical trials for the development of dementia treatments. In the near future, the use of the above methods, in accordance with specific guidelines, along with the use of effective treatments will likely lead to more timely and successful treatment of neurodegenerative dementias.",28072381,PMC5231883,10.11138/fneur/2016.31.4.205,12
The Immunopathogenesis of Alzheimer's Disease Is Related to the Composition of Gut Microbiota,"The microbiota-gut-brain axis plays an important role in the development of neurodegenerative diseases. Commensal and pathogenic enteric bacteria can influence brain and immune system function by the production of lipopolysaccharides and amyloid. Dysbiosis of the intestinal microbiome induces local and consecutively systemic immune-mediated inflammation. Proinflammatory cytokines then trigger neuroinflammation and finally neurodegeneration. Immune-mediated oxidative stress can lead to a deficiency of vitamins and essential micronutrients. Furthermore, the wrong composition of gut microbiota might impair the intake and metabolization of nutrients. In patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) significant alterations of the gut microbiota have been demonstrated. Standard Western diet, infections, decreased physical activity and chronic stress impact the composition and diversity of gut microbiota. A higher abundancy of ""pro-inflammatory"" gut microbiota goes along with enhanced systemic inflammation and neuroinflammatory processes. Thus, AD beginning in the gut is closely related to the imbalance of gut microbiota. Modulation of gut microbiota by Mediterranean diet, probiotics and curcumin can slow down cognitive decline and alter the gut microbiome significantly. A multi-domain intervention approach addressing underlying causes of AD (inflammation, infections, metabolic alterations like insulin resistance and nutrient deficiency, stress) appears very promising to reduce or even reverse cognitive decline by exerting positive effects on the gut microbiota.",33504065,PMC7912578,10.3390/nu13020361,45
A Review on the Natural Components Applied as Lead Compounds for Potential Multi-target Anti-AD Theranostic Agents,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease that seriously affects the health and quality of life of the elderly. Its pathogenesis is very complex and there is still a lack of effective clinical drugs to treat or control the development of AD. Studies have shown that β-amyloid (Aβ) deposition, tau protein hyperphosphorylation, reduced levels of brain cholinergic transmitters, and oxidative stress are the main causes of AD. Furthermore, recent studies showed that metal dyshomeostasis could relate to all the above pathogenesis of AD and was a key factor in the development of AD. Natural compounds and their derivatives have multi-target therapeutic effects on AD, and they also have the advantages of low toxicity, and low cost, which are important directions for anti- AD drugs. Meanwhile, early detection may play an important role in preventing the development of AD. The concept of ""theranostic agent"" combining molecular imaging probes and therapeutic drugs has emerged in recent years. Fluorescence imaging has been widely studied and applied because of its non-invasive, high resolution, high sensitivity, rapid imaging, and low cost. However, at present, most of the research methods in this field use individual therapeutic or diagnostic reagents, which is not conducive to exploring the optimal treatment time window and drug efficacy. Therefore, this work reviewed the natural compounds and their derivatives which all have been studied for both the in vitro and in vivo therapeutic and diagnostic anti-AD activities. At last, structure and activity relationship (SAR) was discussed and potential AD theranostic natural agents were put forwarded to provide a more detailed theoretical basis for the further development of drugs with diagnostic and therapeutic effects in AD.",36698238,,10.2174/0929867330666230125153027,2
"Relationship between physical activity, cognition, and Alzheimer pathology in autosomal dominant Alzheimer's disease","Introduction:Little is known about effects of physical activity (PA) in genetically driven early-onset autosomal dominant Alzheimer's disease (AD).Methods:A total of 372 individuals participating at the Dominantly Inherited Alzheimer Network study were examined to evaluate the cross-sectional relationship of PA with cognitive performance, functional status, cognitive decline, and AD biomarkers in cerebrospinal fluid. Mutation carriers were categorized as high or low exercisers according to WHO recommendations.Results:Mutation carriers with high PA showed significantly better cognitive and functional performance and significantly less AD-like pathology in cerebrospinal fluid than individuals with low PA. Mutation carriers with high PA scored 3.4 points better on Mini Mental State Examination at expected symptom onset and fulfilled the diagnosis of very mild dementia 15.1 years later compared with low exercisers.Discussion:These results support a beneficial effect of PA on cognition and AD pathology even in individuals with genetically driven autosomal dominant AD.",30266303,PMC6322213,10.1016/j.jalz.2018.06.3059,27
SIRT2 Inhibition Rescues Neurodegenerative Pathology but Increases Systemic Inflammation in a Transgenic Mouse Model of Alzheimer's Disease,"Sirtuin 2 (SIRT2) has been proposed to have a central role on aging, inflammation, cancer and neurodegenerative diseases; however, its specific function remains controversial. Recent studies propose SIRT2 pharmacological inhibition as a therapeutic strategy for several neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's disease (AD). Surprisingly, none of these published studies regarding the potential interest of SIRT2 inhibition has assessed the peripheral adverse side consequences of this treatment. In this study, we demonstrate that the specific SIRT2 inhibitor, the compound 33i, does not exhibit genotoxic or mutagenic properties. Moreover, pharmacological treatment with 33i, improved cognitive dysfunction and long-term potentiation, reducing amyloid pathology and neuroinflammation in the APP/PS1 AD mouse model. However, this treatment increased peripheral levels of the inflammatory cytokines IL-1β, TNF, IL-6 and MCP-1. Accordingly, peripheral SIRT2 inhibition with the blood brain barrier impermeable compound AGK-2, worsened the cognitive capacities and increased systemic inflammation. The analysis of human samples revealed that SIRT2 is increased in the brain but not in the serum of AD patients. These results suggest that, although SIRT2 pharmacological inhibition may have beneficial consequences in neurodegenerative diseases, its pharmacological inhibition at the periphery would not be recommended and the systemic adverse side effects should be considered. This information is essential to maximize the therapeutic potential of SIRT2 inhibition not only for AD but also for other neurodegenerative diseases.",37698780,PMC10577113,10.1007/s11481-023-10084-9,1
"[Heparan sulphates, amyloidosis and neurodegeneration]","Introduction:A number of neurodegenerative disorders have been linked directly to the accumulation of amyloid fibres. These fibres are made up of proteins or peptides with altered structures and which join together in vivo in association with heparan sulphate-type polysaccharides.Aims:To examine the most recent concepts in the biology of heparan sulphates and their role in the aggregation of the peptide Abeta, of tau protein, of alpha-synuclein and of prions. The study also seeks to analyse their implications in neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease and prion diseases.Development:In vitro, heparan sulphates have played an important role in the process of oligomerisation and fibrillation of amyloidogenic proteins or peptides, in the stabilisation of these bodies and their resistance to proteolysis, thereby participating in the formation of a wide range of amyloid fibres. Heparan sulphates have also been related to the internalisation of pro-amyloid fibres during the process of intercellular propagation (spreading), which is considered to be crucial in the development of proteinopathies, the best example of which is Alzheimer's disease.Conclusion:This study suggests that the fine structures of heparan sulphates, their localisation in cells and tissues, together with their local concentration, may regulate the amyloidosis processes. The advances made in the understanding of this area of glyconeurobiology will make it possible to improve the understanding of the cell and molecular mechanisms underlying the neurodegenerative process.",29130469,,,1
Epigenetic Basis of Lead-Induced Neurological Disorders,"Environmental lead (Pb) exposure is closely associated with pathogenesis of a range of neurological disorders, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), etc. Epigenetic machinery modulates neural development and activities, while faulty epigenetic regulation contributes to the diverse forms of CNS (central nervous system) abnormalities and diseases. As a potent epigenetic modifier, lead is thought to cause neurological disorders through modulating epigenetic mechanisms. Specifically, increasing evidence linked aberrant DNA methylations, histone modifications as well as ncRNAs (non-coding RNAs) with AD cases, among which circRNA (circular RNA) stands out as a new and promising field for association studies. In 23-year-old primates with developmental lead treatment, Zawia group discovered a variety of epigenetic changes relating to AD pathogenesis. This is a direct evidence implicating epigenetic basis in lead-induced AD animals with an entire lifespan. Additionally, some epigenetic molecules associated with AD etiology were also known to respond to chronic lead exposure in comparable disease models, indicating potentially interlaced mechanisms with respect to the studied neurotoxic and pathological events. Of note, epigenetic molecules acted via globally or selectively influencing the expression of disease-related genes. Compared to AD, the association of lead exposure with other neurological disorders were primarily supported by epidemiological survey, with fewer reports connecting epigenetic regulators with lead-induced pathogenesis. Some pharmaceuticals, such as HDAC (histone deacetylase) inhibitors and DNA methylation inhibitors, were developed to deal with CNS disease by targeting epigenetic components. Still, understandings are insufficient regarding the cause-consequence relations of epigenetic factors and neurological illness. Therefore, clear evidence should be provided in future investigations to address detailed roles of novel epigenetic factors in lead-induced neurological disorders, and efforts of developing specific epigenetic therapeutics should be appraised.",32645824,PMC7370007,10.3390/ijerph17134878,20
Serum urate levels and neurodegenerative outcomes: a prospective cohort study and mendelian randomization analysis of the UK Biobank,"Background:Previous studies on the associations between serum urate levels and neurodegenerative outcomes have yielded inconclusive results, and the causality remains unclear. This study aimed to investigate whether urate levels are associated with the risks of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD), Parkinson's disease (PD), and neurodegenerative deaths.Methods:This prospective study included 382,182 participants (45.7% men) from the UK Biobank cohort. Cox proportional hazards models were used to assess the associations between urate levels and risk of neurodegenerative outcomes. In the Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis, urate-related single-nucleotide polymorphisms were identified through a genome-wide association study. Both linear and non-linear MR approaches were utilized to investigate the potential causal associations.Results:During a median follow-up period of 12 years, we documented 5,400 ADRD cases, 2,553 PD cases, and 1,531 neurodegenerative deaths. Observational data revealed that a higher urate level was associated with a decreased risk of ADRD (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.93, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.90, 0.96), PD (HR: 0.87, 95% CI: 0.82, 0.91), and neurodegenerative death (HR: 0.88, 95% CI: 0.83, 0.94). Negative linear associations between urate levels and neurodegenerative events were observed (all P-values for overall < 0.001 and all P-values for non-linearity > 0.05). However, MR analyses yielded no evidence of either linear or non-linear associations between genetically predicted urate levels and the risk of the aforementioned neurodegenerative events.Conclusion:Although the prospective cohort study demonstrated that elevated urate levels were associated with a reduced risk of neurodegenerative outcomes, MR analyses found no evidence of causality.",38730474,PMC11088014,10.1186/s13195-024-01476-x,0
"Communal interaction of glycation and gut microbes in diabetes mellitus, Alzheimer's disease, and Parkinson's disease pathogenesis","Diabetes and its complications, Alzheimer's disease (AD), and Parkinson's disease (PD) are increasing gradually, reflecting a global threat vis-à-vis expressing the essentiality of a substantial paradigm shift in research and remedial actions. Protein glycation is influenced by several factors, like time, temperature, pH, metal ions, and the half-life of the protein. Surprisingly, most proteins associated with metabolic and neurodegenerative disorders are generally long-lived and hence susceptible to glycation. Remarkably, proteins linked with diabetes, AD, and PD share this characteristic. This modulates protein's structure, aggregation tendency, and toxicity, highlighting renovated attention. Gut microbes and microbial metabolites marked their importance in human health and diseases. Though many scientific shreds of evidence are proposed for possible change and dysbiosis in gut flora in these diseases, very little is known about the mechanisms. Screening and unfolding their functionality in metabolic and neurodegenerative disorders is essential in hunting the gut treasure. Therefore, it is imperative to evaluate the role of glycation as a common link in diabetes and neurodegenerative diseases, which helps to clarify if modulation of nonenzymatic glycation may act as a beneficial therapeutic strategy and gut microbes/metabolites may answer some of the crucial questions. This review briefly emphasizes the common functional attributes of glycation and gut microbes, the possible linkages, and discusses current treatment options and therapeutic challenges.",37589449,,10.1002/med.21987,2
CD33 isoforms in microglia and Alzheimer's disease: Friend and foe,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of neurodegenerative disease and is considered the main cause of dementia worldwide. Genome-wide association studies combined with integrated analysis of functional datasets support a critical role for microglia in AD pathogenesis, identifying them as important potential therapeutic targets. The ability of immunomodulatory receptors on microglia to control the response to pathogenic amyloid-β aggregates has gained significant interest. Siglec-3, also known as CD33, is one of these immunomodulatory receptors expressed on microglia that has been identified as an AD susceptibility factor. Here, we review recent advances made in understanding the multifaceted roles that CD33 plays in microglia with emphasis on two human-specific CD33 isoforms that differentially correlate with AD susceptibility. We also describe several different therapeutic approaches for targeting CD33 that have been advanced for the purpose of skewing microglial cell responses.",35940942,,10.1016/j.mam.2022.101111,9
National Dementia BioBank: A Strategy for the Diagnosis and Study of Neurodegenerative Diseases in México,"We recently developed the National Dementia Biobank in México (BioBanco Nacional de Demencias, BND) as a unit for diagnosis, research, and tissue transfer for research purposes. BND is associated with the Facultad de Estudios Superiores Cuautitlán, Universidad Nacional Autónoma de Mexico (UNAM), Mexico. The donation of fluids, brain, and other organs of deceased donors is crucial for understanding the underlying mechanisms of neurodegenerative diseases and for the development of successful treatment. Our laboratory research focuses on 1) analysis of the molecular processing of the proteins involved in those neurodegenerative diseases termed tauopathies and 2) the search for biomarkers for the non-invasive and early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease.",32568191,,10.3233/JAD-191015,3
A Unifying Hypothesis for Alzheimer's Disease: From Plaques to Neurodegeneration,"Evidence suggests that amyloid β is highly toxic to synapses in a phospho-Tau-dependent manner. Here, I present a hypothesis that links previous evidence from the first rise of amyloid β through to Tau tangles and neurodegeneration. In the immediate vicinity of plaques, concentrated soluble amyloid β occurs in equilibrium with deposited forms. Initially, plaques cover only a small percentage of brain volume. Microglia, by efficiently removing damaged synapses, may prevent spread of damage along the axon, restricting damage to the immediate vicinity of plaques. However, as plaque load increases, as seen in Alzheimer's disease, an individual axon may suffer multiple points of damage, leading to dissociation of Tau, formation of a tangle, and loss of the axon. As more axons suffer this fate, the network eventually degenerates. According to this hypothesis, the degree of plaque load that an individual can tolerate would depend on the efficiency of their microglia in removing amyloid-β-damaged synapses and the distribution of plaques, relative to axon trajectories, would determine the eventual cognitive symptoms.",31006494,,10.1016/j.tins.2019.03.003,56
Neuroendocrine Disturbances in Neurodegenerative Disorders: A Scoping Review,"Background:Neurodegenerative diseases cause progressive irreversible neuronal loss that has broad downstream effects. The neuroendocrine system regulates homeostasis of circuits that control critical functions such as the stress response, metabolism, reproduction, fluid balance, and glucose control. These systems are frequently disrupted in neurodegenerative disorders yet often overlooked in clinical practice.Objective:This review aims to gather the available data regarding these disturbances in Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, frontotemporal dementia, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and Huntington's disease and also to demonstrate the volume of literature in these individual arenas.Methods:Using the scoping review framework, a literature search was performed in PubMed to identify relevant articles published within the past 30 years (January 1988 to November 2018). The search criteria produced a total of 2022 articles, 328 of which were identified as relevant to this review.Results:Several major themes emerged from this review. These neuroendocrine disturbances may be a precursor to the illness, a part of the primary pathophysiology, or a direct consequence of the disease or independent of it. They have the potential to further understanding of the disease, exacerbate the underlying pathology, or provide therapeutic benefit.Conclusions:By synthesizing the data from a systems' perspective, we aim to broaden how clinicians think about these illnesses and provide care.",31918850,,10.1016/j.psym.2019.11.002,5
Epigenetic Regulation of Amyloid-beta Metabolism in Alzheimer's Disease,"Senile plaques (SPs) are one of the pathological features of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and they are formed by the overproduction and aggregation of amyloid-beta (Aβ) peptides derived from the abnormal cleavage of amyloid precursor protein (APP). Thus, understanding the regulatory mechanisms during Aβ metabolism is of great importance to elucidate AD pathogenesis. Recent studies have shown that epigenetic modulation-including DNA methylation, non-coding RNA alterations, and histone modifications-is of great significance in regulating Aβ metabolism. In this article, we review the aberrant epigenetic regulation of Aβ metabolism.",33428129,,10.1007/s11596-020-2283-0,4
Religious Orders Study and Rush Memory and Aging Project,Background:The Religious Orders Study and Rush Memory and Aging Project are both ongoing longitudinal clinical-pathologic cohort studies of aging and Alzheimer's disease (AD).Objectives:To summarize progress over the past five years and its implications for understanding neurodegenerative diseases.Methods:Participants in both studies are older adults who enroll without dementia and agree to detailed longitudinal clinical evaluations and organ donation. The last review summarized findings through the end of 2011. Here we summarize progress and study findings over the past five years and discuss new directions for how these studies can inform on aging and AD in the future.Results:We summarize 1) findings on the relation of neurobiology to clinical AD; 2) neurobiologic pathways linking risk factors to clinical AD; 3) non-cognitive AD phenotypes including motor function and decision making; 4) the development of a novel drug discovery platform.Conclusion:Complexity at multiple levels needs to be understood and overcome to develop effective treatments and preventions for cognitive decline and AD dementia.,29865057,PMC6380522,10.3233/JAD-179939,553
Natural Products for the Treatment of Neurodegenerative Diseases,"Neurodegenerative diseases are a heterogeneous group of disorders characterized by the progressive degeneration of the structure and function of the central nervous system or peripheral nervous system. Alzheimer's Disease (AD), Parkinson's Disease (PD) and Spinal Cord Injury (SCI) are the common neurodegenerative diseases, which typically occur in people over the age of 60. With the rapid development of an aged society, over 60 million people worldwide are suffering from these uncurable diseases. Therefore, the search for new drugs and therapeutic methods has become an increasingly important research topic. Natural products especially those from the Traditional Chinese Medicines (TCMs), are the most important sources of drugs, and have received extensive interest among pharmacist. In this review, in order to facilitate further chemical modification of those useful natural products by pharmacists, we will bring together recent studies in single natural compound from TCMs with neuroprotective effect.",31131744,,10.2174/0929867326666190527120614,10
Association between Alzheimer's Disease and Oral and Gut Microbiota: Are Pore Forming Proteins the Missing Link?,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative condition affecting millions of people worldwide. It is associated with cerebral amyloid-β (Aβ) plaque deposition in the brain, synaptic disconnection, and subsequent progressive neuronal death. Although considerable progress has been made to elucidate the pathogenesis of AD, the specific causes of the disease remain highly unknown. Recent research has suggested a potential association between certain infectious diseases and dementia, either directly due to bacterial brain invasion and toxin production, or indirectly by modulating the immune response. Therefore, in the present review we focus on the emerging issues of bacterial infection and AD, including the existence of antimicrobial peptides having pore-forming properties that act in a similar way to pores formed by Aβ in a variety of cell membranes. Special focus is placed on oral bacteria and biofilms, and on the potential mechanisms associating bacterial infection and toxin production in AD. The role of bacterial outer membrane vesicles on the transport and delivery of toxins as well as porins to the brain is also discussed. Aβ has shown to possess antimicrobial activity against several bacteria, and therefore could be upregulated as a response to bacteria and bacterial toxins in the brain. Although further research is needed, we believe that the control of biofilm-mediated diseases could be an important potential prevention mechanism for AD development.",30040725,,10.3233/JAD-180319,23
miRNAs in Alzheimer Disease - A Therapeutic Perspective,"Background:Alzheimer's disease is a neurodegenerative disorder which generally affects people who are more than 60 years of age. The disease is clinically characterised by dementia, loss of cognitive functions and massive neurodegeneration. The presence of neurofibrilary tangles and amyloid plaques in the hippocampal region of the brain are the hallmarks of the disease. Current therapeutic approaches for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease are symptomatic and disease modifying, none of which provide any permanent solution or cure for the disease. Dysregulation of miRNAs is one of the major causes of neurodegeneration.Conclusion:In the present review, the roles of different miRNAs such as miR-9, miR-107, miR-29, miR-34, miR-181, miR-106, miR-146a, miR132, miR124a, miR153 has been discussed in detail in the pathogenesis of various neurodegenerative diseases with special focus on AD. The probability of miRNAs as an alternative and more sensitive approach for detection and management of the AD has also been discussed.",28847283,,10.2174/1567205014666170829101016,38
Microbiome Influence in the Pathogenesis of Prion and Alzheimer's Diseases,"Misfolded and abnormal β-sheets forms of wild-type proteins, such as cellular prion protein (PrPC) and amyloid beta (Aβ), are believed to be the vectors of neurodegenerative diseases, prion and Alzheimer's disease (AD), respectively. Increasing evidence highlights the ""prion-like"" seeding of protein aggregates as a mechanism for pathological spread in AD, tauopathy, as well as in other neurodegenerative diseases, such as Parkinson's. Mutations in both PrPCand Aβ precursor protein (APP), have been associated with the pathogenesis of these fatal disorders with clear evidence for their pathogenic significance. In addition, a critical role for the gut microbiota is emerging; indeed, as a consequence of gut-brain axis alterations, the gut microbiota has been involved in the regulation of Aβ production in AD and, through the microglial inflammation, in the amyloid fibril formation, in prion diseases. Here, we aim to review the role of microbiome (""the other human genome"") alterations in AD and prion disease pathogenesis.",31547531,PMC6801937,10.3390/ijms20194704,28
Neurodegenerative Disease Associated Pathways in the Brains of Triple Transgenic Alzheimer's Model Mice Are Reversed Following Two Weeks of Peripheral Administration of Fasudil,"The pan Rho-associated coiled-coil-containing protein kinase (ROCK) inhibitor fasudil acts as a vasodilator and has been used as a medication for post-cerebral stroke for the past 29 years in Japan and China. More recently, based on the involvement of ROCK inhibition in synaptic function, neuronal survival, and processes associated with neuroinflammation, it has been suggested that the drug may be repurposed for neurodegenerative diseases. Indeed, fasudil has demonstrated preclinical efficacy in many neurodegenerative disease models. To facilitate an understanding of the wider biological processes at play due to ROCK inhibition in the context of neurodegeneration, we performed a global gene expression analysis on the brains of Alzheimer's disease model mice treated with fasudil via peripheral IP injection. We then performed a comparative analysis of the fasudil-driven transcriptional profile with profiles generated from a meta-analysis of multiple neurodegenerative diseases. Our results show that fasudil tends to drive gene expression in a reverse sense to that seen in brains with post-mortem neurodegenerative disease. The results are most striking in terms of pathway enrichment analysis, where pathways perturbed in Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases are overwhelmingly driven in the opposite direction by fasudil treatment. Thus, our results bolster the repurposing potential of fasudil by demonstrating an anti-neurodegenerative phenotype in a disease context and highlight the potential of in vivo transcriptional profiling of drug activity.",37446396,PMC10342807,10.3390/ijms241311219,2
Molecular imaging mass spectrometry for probing protein dynamics in neurodegenerative disease pathology,"Recent advances in the understanding of basic pathological mechanisms in various neurological diseases depend directly on the development of novel bioanalytical technologies that allow sensitive and specific chemical imaging at high resolution in cells and tissues. Mass spectrometry-based molecular imaging (IMS) has gained increasing popularity in biomedical research for mapping the spatial distribution of molecular species in situ. The technology allows for comprehensive, untargeted delineation of in situ distribution profiles of metabolites, lipids, peptides and proteins. A major advantage of IMS over conventional histochemical techniques is its superior molecular specificity. Imaging mass spectrometry has therefore great potential for probing molecular regulations in CNS-derived tissues and cells for understanding neurodegenerative disease mechanism. The goal of this review is to familiarize the reader with the experimental workflow, instrumental developments and methodological challenges as well as to give a concise overview of the major advances and recent developments and applications of IMS-based protein and peptide profiling with particular focus on neurodegenerative diseases. This article is part of the Special Issue ""Proteomics"".",30040875,,10.1111/jnc.14559,17
[Alzheimer's disease today],As a result of the development of neurodegenerative diseases our societies are faced with a major challenge.

The Functions and Phenotypes of Microglia in Alzheimer's Disease,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prevalent neurodegenerative disease worldwide, but therapeutic strategies to slow down AD pathology and symptoms have not yet been successful. While attention has been focused on neurodegeneration in AD pathogenesis, recent decades have provided evidence of the importance of microglia, and resident immune cells in the central nervous system. In addition, new technologies, including single-cell RNA sequencing, have revealed heterogeneous cell states of microglia in AD. In this review, we systematically summarize the microglial response to amyloid-β and tau tangles, and the risk factor genes expressed in microglia. Furthermore, we discuss the characteristics of protective microglia that appear during AD pathology and the relationship between AD and microglia-induced inflammation during chronic pain. Understanding the diverse roles of microglia will help identify new therapeutic strategies for AD.",37190116,PMC10136897,10.3390/cells12081207,3
The Gut-Brain Axis in Alzheimer's Disease and Omega-3. A Critical Overview of Clinical Trials,"Despite intensive study, neurodegenerative diseases remain insufficiently understood, precluding rational design of therapeutic interventions that can reverse or even arrest the progressive loss of neurological function. In the last decade, several theories investigating the causes of neurodegenerative diseases have been formulated and a condition or risk factor that can contribute is described by the gut-brain axis hypothesis: stress, unbalanced diet, and drugs impact altering microbiota composition which contributes to dysbiosis. An altered gut microbiota may lead to a dysbiotic condition and to a subsequent increase in intestinal permeability, causing the so-called leaky-gut syndrome. Herein, in this review we report recent findings in clinical trials on the risk factor of the gut-brain axis in Alzheimer's disease and on the effect of omega-3 supplementation, in shifting gut microbiota balance towards an eubiosis status. Despite this promising effect, evidences reported in selected randomized clinical trials on the effect of omega-3 fatty acid on cognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease are few. Only Mild Cognitive Impairment, a prodromal state that could precede the progress to Alzheimer's disease could be affected by omega-3 FA supplementation. We report some of the critical issues which emerged from these studies. Randomized controlled trials in well-selected AD patients considering the critical points underlined in this review are warranted.",30205543,PMC6164598,10.3390/nu10091267,30
[Potential biomarkers of early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease],"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease of the brain, in which there are cognitive and behavioral disorders, but also visual impairment can occur. Deposits of beta-amyloid (Aβ) were also found in the retina of AD patients. At the same time, primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) occupies the first place among geronto-ophthalmic pathologies in patients with AD. POAG, like AD, is a neurodegenerative disease. AD and POAG have common symptoms, and therefore several common principles for their early diagnosis can be developed. Therefore, a promising direction is the search for biomarkers for the early detection of AD and POAG. Currently, the diagnosis of early AD biomarkers in cerebrospinal fluid and biomarkers in the brain (imaging of amyloid plaques and tau positron emission tomography) are well studied, while data in literature on using these biomarkers in patients with POAG is scarce. However, the above diagnostic methods are not considered in routine clinical practice due to their invasiveness and high cost. There is a growing need for conventional, affordable biomarkers for AD and POAG, as it is necessary to start treatment of prodromal conditions from symptoms to onset of symptoms. In this connection, biomarkers such as Aβ and tau protein in blood serum and plasma are actively evaluated in patients with AD. In patients with POAG, there is no published data on studies of these biomarkers, which requires scientific research. Many authors discover the role of sirtuins (SIRT) in aging and age-related diseases, such as AD, glaucoma, age-related macular degeneration, and others. Possibly, SIRT could become potential biomarkers of neurodegenerative diseases.",36168682,,10.17116/jnevro20221220917,0
Detecting Non-cognitive Features of Prodromal Neurodegenerative Diseases,"Background:Prodromal Neurodegenerative Disease (ND) due to tauopathies such as Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and Synucleinopathies (SN) such as Parkinson's Disease (PD) and Dementia with Lewy Bodies (DLB) present subtly. Although ND are considered cognitive disorders, in fact ND present with behavioral and even medical symptomatology years to decades prior to the onset of cognitive changes. Recognizing prodromal ND syndromes is a public health priority because ND is common, disabling and expensive. Diagnosing prodromal ND in real world clinical settings is challenging because ND of the same pathology can present with different symptoms in different people. Individual variability in nature and variability in nurture across the life course influence how ND pathology manifests clinically. The objective of this study was to describe how non-cognitive symptoms from behavioral, medical, neurological and psychiatric domains cluster in prodromal and early stages of ND.Methods:This was an observational study of patients receiving routine clinical care for memory disorders. All patients receiving a standardized evaluation including complete neurological history and examination and standardized brief neuropsychological testing. A Principal Component Analysis (PCA) considering emotion, motor, sensory and sleep factors was performed on the entire sample of patients in order to identify co-occurring symptom clusters. All patients received a consensus diagnosis adjudicated by at least two dementia experts. Patients were grouped into Cognitively Normal, Detectable Cognitive Impairment, and Mild Cognitive Impairment categories due to AD and/or PD/LBD or NOS pathology. Symptom cluster scores were compared between clinical diagnostic groups.Results:In this study 165 patients completed baseline neuropsychological testing and reported subjective measures of non-cognitive symptoms. Four syndrome specific symptom factors emerged and eight non-specific symptom factors. Symptoms of personality changes, paranoia, hallucinations, cravings, agitation, and changes in appetite grouped together into a cluster consistent with an ""SN Non-motor Phenotype"". Appetite, walking, balance, hearing, increased falls, and dandruff grouped together into a cluster consistent with an ""SN Motor Phenotype"". The Prodromal AD phenotype included symptoms of anxiety, irritability, apathy, sleep disturbance and social isolation. The fourth factor included symptoms of increased sweating, twitching, and tremor grouped into a cluster consistent with an Autonomic phenotype.Conclusion:Non-cognitive features can be reliably measured by self-report in busy clinical settings. Such measurement can be useful in distinguishing patients with different etiologies of ND. Better characterization of unique, prodromal, non-cognitive ND trajectories could improve public health efforts to modify the course of ND for all patients at risk.",30845903,PMC6635426,10.2174/1874609812666190204094233,4
The Olfactory Trail of Neurodegenerative Diseases,"Alterations in olfactory functions are proposed as possible early biomarkers of neurodegenerative diseases. Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases manifest olfactory dysfunction as a symptom, which is worth mentioning. The alterations do not occur in all patients, but they can serve to rule out neurodegenerative pathologies that are not associated with small deficits. Several prevalent neurodegenerative conditions, including impaired smell, arise in the early stages of Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases, presenting an attractive prospect as a snitch for early diagnosis. This review covers the current knowledge on the link between olfactory deficits and Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases. The review also covers the emergence of olfactory receptors as actors in the pathophysiology of these diseases. Olfactory receptors are not exclusively expressed in olfactory sensory neurons. Olfactory receptors are widespread in the human body; they are expressed, among others, in the testicles, lungs, intestines, kidneys, skin, heart, and blood cells. Although information on these ectopically expressed olfactory receptors is limited, they appear to be involved in cell recognition, migration, proliferation, wound healing, apoptosis, and exocytosis. Regarding expression in non-chemosensory regions of the central nervous system (CNS), future research should address the role, in both the glia and neurons, of olfactory receptors. Here, we review the limited but relevant information on the altered expression of olfactory receptor genes in Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases. By unraveling how olfactory receptor activation is involved in neurodegeneration and identifying links between olfactory structures and neuronal death, valuable information could be gained for early diagnosis and intervention strategies in neurodegenerative diseases.",38607054,PMC11012126,10.3390/cells13070615,0
Driving Difficulties Among Patients with Alzheimer's Disease and Other Neurodegenerative Disorders,"Background/objective:Neurodegenerative disorders impact fitness to drive of older drivers, but on-road driving studies investigating patients with different neurodegenerative disorders are scarce. A variety of driving errors have been reported in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD), but it is unclear which types of driving errors occur most frequently. Moreover, patients with other neurodegenerative disorders than AD typically present with different symptoms and impairments, therefore different driving errors may be expected.Methods:Patients with AD (n = 80), patients with other neurodegenerative disorders with cognitive decline (i.e., vascular dementia, frontotemporal dementia, dementia with Lewy bodies/Parkinson's disease, n = 59), and healthy older drivers (n = 45) participated in a fitness-to-drive assessment study including on-road driving.Results:Patients with AD performed significantly worse than healthy older drivers on operational, tactical, visual, and global aspects of on-road driving. In patients with AD, on-road measures were significantly associated with 'off-road' measures. Patients with neurodegenerative disorders other than AD showed large overlap in the types of driving errors. Several driving errors were identified that appear to be characteristic for patients with particular neurodegenerative disorders.Conclusion:Patients from each group of neurodegenerative disorders commonly display tactical driving errors regarding lane positioning, slow driving, observation of the blind spot, and scanning behavior. Several other tactical and operational driving errors, including not communicating with cyclists and unsteady steering, were more frequently observed in patients with non-AD neurodegenerative disorders. These findings have implications for on-road and 'off-road' fitness-to-drive assessments for patients with neurodegenerative disorders with cognitive decline.",31045516,,10.3233/JAD-181095,10
Clinical Research Investigating Alzheimer's Disease in China: Current Status and Future Perspectives Toward Prevention,"Based on the background of research investigating brain aging and neurodegenerative diseases in China, the present review addresses Alzheimer's disease (AD), one of the most common types of neurodegenerative diseases, clinical research progress, and prospects for future development in China.",35841254,,10.14283/jpad.2022.46,3
Examples of Inverse Comorbidity between Cancer and Neurodegenerative Diseases: A Possible Role for Noncoding RNA,"Cancer is one of the most common causes of death; in parallel, the incidence and prevalence of central nervous system diseases are equally high. Among neurodegenerative diseases, Alzheimer's dementia is the most common, while Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most frequent neurodegenerative disease. There is a significant amount of evidence on the complex biological connection between cancer and neurodegeneration. Noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) are defined as transcribed nucleotides that perform a variety of regulatory functions. The mechanisms by which ncRNAs exert their functions are numerous and involve every aspect of cellular life. The same ncRNA can act in multiple ways, leading to different outcomes; in fact, a single ncRNA can participate in the pathogenesis of more than one disease-even if these seem very different, as cancer and neurodegenerative disorders are. The ncRNA activates specific pathways leading to one or the other clinical phenotype, sometimes with obvious mechanisms of inverse comorbidity. We aimed to collect from the existing literature examples of inverse comorbidity in which ncRNAs seem to play a key role. We also investigated the example of mir-519a-3p, and one of its target genes Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase 1, for the inverse comorbidity mechanism between some cancers and PD. We believe it is very important to study the inverse comorbidity relationship between cancer and neurodegenerative diseases because it will help us to better assess these two major areas of human disease.",35741059,PMC9221903,10.3390/cells11121930,15
Mechanistic insights into the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases: towards the development of effective therapy,"Neurodegeneration is a prevalent and one of the emerging reasons for morbidity, mortality, and cognitive impairment in aging. Dementia is one of such conditions of neurodegeneration, partially manageable, irreversible, and worsens over time. This review is focused on biological and psychosocial risk factors associated with Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases, highlighting the value of cognitive decline. We further emphasized on current therapeutic strategies from pharmacological and non-pharmacological perspectives focusing on their effects on cognitive impairment, protein aggregation, tau pathology, and improving the quality of life. Deeper mechanistic insights into the multifactorial neurodegeneration could offer the design and development of promising diagnostic and therapeutic strategies.",33687588,,10.1007/s11010-021-04120-6,7
Genetic Dissection of Alzheimer's Disease UsingDrosophilaModels,"Alzheimer's disease (AD), a main cause of dementia, is the most common neurodegenerative disease that is related to abnormal accumulation of the amyloid β (Aβ) protein. Despite decades of intensive research, the mechanisms underlying AD remain elusive, and the only available treatment remains symptomatic. Molecular understanding of the pathogenesis and progression of AD is necessary to develop disease-modifying treatment.Drosophila, as the most advanced genetic model, has been used to explore the molecular mechanisms of AD in the last few decades. Here, we introduceDrosophilaAD models based on human Aβ and summarize the results of their genetic dissection. We also discuss the utility of functional genomics using theDrosophilasystem in the search for AD-associated molecular mechanisms in the post-genomic era.",32019113,PMC7037931,10.3390/ijms21030884,13
CSF sAPPα and sAPPβ levels in Alzheimer's Disease and Multiple Other Neurodegenerative Diseases: A Network Meta-Analysis,"The soluble amyloid protein procurer α (sAPPα) and β (sAPPβ) have been postulated as promising new cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease (AD) and multiple other neurodegenerative diseases, but have failed to meet expectations with their often discordant and even contradictory findings to date. The aim of the study was to systematically explore this issue. Cochrane Library, PubMed, and CNKI were systematically searched without language or date restrictions. This network meta-analysis followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines and also adhered to the Meta-analysis Of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (MOOSE) guidelines. Twenty studies, comprising ten groups, were eligible and included. Overall, 19 eligible studies with 1634 patients contributed to the analysis of CSF sAPPα levels and 16 eligible studies with 1684 patients contributed to the analysis of CSF sAPPβ levels. CSF sAPPβ levels are significantly higher in AD than in corticobasal syndrome (CBS) and progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP); higher in Control than in Depression, CBS and PSP; higher in Parkinson's disease dementia (PDD) than in CBS and PSP; higher in mild cognitive impairment progressed to AD dementia during the follow-up period (pMCI) than in Depression and PSP; higher in stable mild cognitive impairment (sMCI) than in Depression. With regard to CSF sAPPα levels, there were no significant difference among groups. However, surprisingly, the resultant rankings graphically showed that pMCI populations have the highest levels of CSF sAPPα and sAPPβ. Furthermore, it seemed there was a positive correlation between CSF sAPPα and sAPPβ levels. The measurement of CSF sAPPα and sAPPβ levels may provide an alternative method for the diagnosis of early-stage AD, pMCI, which is conducive to preventive therapy.",31414383,,10.1007/s12017-019-08561-7,4
Increased plasma DYRK1A with aging may protect against neurodegenerative diseases,"Early markers are needed for more effective prevention of Alzheimer's disease. We previously showed that individuals with Alzheimer's disease have decreased plasma DYRK1A levels compared to controls. We assessed DYRK1A in the plasma of cognitively healthy elderly volunteers, individuals with either Alzheimer's disease (AD), tauopathies or Down syndrome (DS), and in lymphoblastoids from individuals with DS. DYRK1A levels were inversely correlated with brain amyloid β burden in asymptomatic elderly individuals and AD patients. Low DYRK1A levels were also detected in patients with tauopathies. Individuals with DS had higher DYRK1A levels than controls, although levels were lower in individuals with DS and with dementia. These data suggest that plasma DYRK1A levels could be used for early detection of at risk individuals of AD and for early detection of AD. We hypothesize that lack of increase of DYRK1A at middle age (40-50 years) could be a warning before the cognitive decline, reflecting increased risk for AD.",37015911,PMC10073199,10.1038/s41398-023-02419-0,1
Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation in Neurodegenerative Disorders,"Cortical excitability modulation and neuroplasticity are considered essential mechanisms for improving clinical and cognitive abilities in neurodegenerative disorders (NDDs). In such context, transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) shows great promise for facilitating remodeling of neurosynaptic organization. The aim of this review was to provide an overview of how tDCS is currently used as a neurorehabilitation strategy in some NDDs. We describe results from studies in which tDCS was applied in mild cognitive impairment, Alzheimer's disease, and primary progressive aphasia. Currently, findings related to the ability of tDCS to restore cognitive dysfunctions and behavioral impairments in these NDDs do not seem to support the notion that tDCS shows clear therapeutic efficacy in patients with mild cognitive impairment, Alzheimer disease, and primary progressive aphasia. This is probably because tDCS research in this area is still in its early stages. Methodological concerns, such as differences in tDCS parameters (eg, intensity or duration), target sites, and study design (eg, the relationship between tDCS and the rehabilitation strategy), or the use of underpowered sample sizes may also contribute to these outcomes. Nevertheless, it is important to note that almost no studies have evaluated how the underlying neurophysiological state of patients should guide the application of tDCS. These results should not prevent the use of tDCS in these NDDs, but they should trigger a deeper evaluation of how tDCS should be used. Transcranial direct current stimulation cannot be considered a neurorehabilitation apparatus by itself but should be instead viewed as a method for weakly modulating existing brain excitability. Future studies should aim to improve our understanding of the neurophysiological mechanisms that underlie the clinical effects of tDCS with the final goal of designing and performing individualized stimulation protocols that can be tailored for each NDD patient and combined with other appropriate neurorehabilitation strategies.",30095683,,10.1097/YCT.0000000000000539,14
From Recognition to Remedy: The Significance of Biomarkers in Neurodegenerative Disease Pathology,"With the inexorable aging of the global populace, neurodegenerative diseases (NDs) like Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) pose escalating challenges, which are underscored by their socioeconomic repercussions. A pivotal aspect in addressing these challenges lies in the elucidation and application of biomarkers for timely diagnosis, vigilant monitoring, and effective treatment modalities. This review delineates the quintessence of biomarkers in the realm of NDs, elucidating various classifications and their indispensable roles. Particularly, the quest for novel biomarkers in AD, transcending traditional markers in PD, and the frontier of biomarker research in ALS are scrutinized. Emergent susceptibility and trait markers herald a new era of personalized medicine, promising enhanced treatment initiation especially in cases of SOD1-ALS. The discourse extends to diagnostic and state markers, revolutionizing early detection and monitoring, alongside progression markers that unveil the trajectory of NDs, propelling forward the potential for tailored interventions. The synergy between burgeoning technologies and innovative techniques like -omics, histologic assessments, and imaging is spotlighted, underscoring their pivotal roles in biomarker discovery. Reflecting on the progress hitherto, the review underscores the exigent need for multidisciplinary collaborations to surmount the challenges ahead, accelerate biomarker discovery, and herald a new epoch of understanding and managing NDs. Through a panoramic lens, this article endeavors to provide a comprehensive insight into the burgeoning field of biomarkers in NDs, spotlighting the promise they hold in transforming the diagnostic landscape, enhancing disease management, and illuminating the pathway toward efficacious therapeutic interventions.",38003309,PMC10671641,10.3390/ijms242216119,0
Stem Cell-based Therapeutic and Diagnostic Approaches in Alzheimer's Disease,"Background:Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative impairment mainly recognized by memory loss and cognitive deficits. However, the current therapies against AD are mostly limited to palliative medications, prompting researchers to investigate more efficient therapeutic approaches for AD, such as stem cell therapy. Recent evidence has proposed that extensive neuronal and synaptic loss and altered adult neurogenesis, which is perceived pivotal in terms of plasticity and network maintenance, occurs early in the course of AD, which exacerbates neuronal vulnerability to AD. Thus, regeneration and replenishing the depleted neuronal networks by strengthening the endogenous repair mechanisms or exogenous stem cells and their cargoes is a rational therapeutic approach. Currently, several stem cell-based therapies as well as stem cell products like exosomes, have shown promising results in the early diagnosis of AD.Objective:This review begins with a comparison between AD and normal aging pathophysiology and a discussion on open questions in the field. Next, summarizing the current stem cell-based therapeutic and diagnostic approaches, we declare the advantages and disadvantages of each method. Also, we comprehensively evaluate the human clinical trials of stem cell therapies for AD.Methodology:Peer-reviewed reports were extracted through Embase, PubMed, and Google Scholar until 2021.Results:With several ongoing clinical trials, stem cells and their derivatives (e.g., exosomes) are an emerging and encouraging field in diagnosing and treating neurodegenerative diseases. Although stem cell therapies have been successful in animal models, numerous clinical trials in AD patients have yielded unpromising results, which we will further discuss.",34970956,PMC9886816,10.2174/1570159X20666211231090659,5
How to use neuroimaging biomarkers in the diagnosis framework of neurodegenerative diseases?,"Neuroimaging biomarkers, together with CSF biomarkers, are more and more used to support the early and differential clinical diagnosis of neurodegenerative diseases in clinical setting that have access to those techniques. Based on a consensus of multidisciplinary experts leading to a princeps publication in the Lancet Neurology [Chételat et al., Lancet Neurol 2020; 19: 951-62], we proposed a three-arm diagnosis algorithm detailing the optimal combination of biomarkers for the diagnosis of neurodegenerative diseases according to the clinical presentation. The main conclusions of this princeps article are summarized here, including a brief overview of the complementarity of the most validated neuroimaging biomarkers available, and an argued presentation of the proposed diagnosis algorithm.",35504738,,10.1016/j.neurol.2022.03.006,1
Novel strategies for the fight of Alzheimer's disease targeting amyloid-β protein,"Alzheimer's disease (AD), which is recognised as a devastating neurodegenerative disease throughout the world and lack of effective treatments, is a growing concern in modern society with a growing population of elderly patients. A growing number of studies reveal that abnormal accumulation and deposition of Aβ is responsible for AD. Inspired by this, strategies for the treatment of AD targeting-Aβ clearance have been discussed for a long period, exploring new drugs which is capable of destroying soluble Aβ oligomers and unsolvable Aβ aggregates. In this paper, results of recent clinical trials on several anti-amyloid-β drugs are presented and several emerging anti-amyloid AD therapies based on recent studies are reviewed. Furthermore, some of the current challenges and novel strategies to prevent AD are addressed. Herein, this review focuses on current pharmacotherapy of AD targeting-Aβ and intends to design a promising therapeutic agent for AD treatment.",34435898,,10.1080/1061186X.2021.1973482,2
"Links between COVID-19 and Parkinson's disease/Alzheimer's disease: reciprocal impacts, medical care strategies and underlying mechanisms","The impact of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic on patients with neurodegenerative diseases and the specific neurological manifestations of COVID-19 have aroused great interest. However, there are still many issues of concern to be clarified. Therefore, we review the current literature on the complex relationship between COVID-19 and neurodegenerative diseases with an emphasis on Parkinson's disease (PD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). We summarize the impact of COVID-19 infection on symptom severity, disease progression, and mortality rate of PD and AD, and discuss whether COVID-19 infection could trigger PD and AD. In addition, the susceptibility to and the prognosis of COVID-19 in PD patients and AD patients are also included. In order to achieve better management of PD and AD patients, modifications of care strategies, specific drug therapies, and vaccines during the pandemic are also listed. At last, mechanisms underlying the link of COVID-19 with PD and AD are reviewed.",36717892,PMC9885419,10.1186/s40035-023-00337-1,6
Recent Advances on the Role of Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) in Neurodegenerative Diseases,"Neurotrophins, such as brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), are essential for neuronal survival and growth. The signaling cascades initiated by BDNF and its receptor are the key regulators of synaptic plasticity, which plays important role in learning and memory formation. Changes in BDNF levels and signaling pathways have been identified in several neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and Huntington's disease, and have been linked with the symptoms and course of these diseases. This review summarizes the current understanding of the role of BDNF in several neurodegenerative diseases, as well as the underlying molecular mechanism. The therapeutic potential of BDNF treatment is also discussed, in the hope of discovering new avenues for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases.",35743271,PMC9224343,10.3390/ijms23126827,24
Elucidating the Structures of Amyloid Oligomers with Macrocyclic β-Hairpin Peptides: Insights into Alzheimer's Disease and Other Amyloid Diseases,"In the more than a century since its identification, Alzheimer's disease has become the archetype of amyloid diseases. The first glimpses of the chemical basis of Alzheimer's disease began with the identification of ""amyloid"" plaques in the brain in 1892 and extended to the identification of proteinaceous fibrils with ""cross-β"" structure in 1968. Further efforts led to the discovery of the β-amyloid peptide, Aβ, as a 40- or 42-amino acid peptide that is responsible for the plaques and fibrils. At this point, a three-decade-long marathon began to elucidate the structure of the fibrils and identify the molecular basis of Alzheimer's disease. Along the way, an alternative model began to emerge in which small aggregates of Aβ, called ""oligomers"", rather than fibrils, are the culprits that lead to neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's disease. This Account describes what is known about the structures of the fibrils and details our research group's efforts to understand the structural, biophysical, and biological properties of the oligomers in amyloid diseases. β-Sheets are the building blocks of amyloid fibrils and oligomers. Amyloid fibrils generally consist of extended networks of parallel β-sheets. Amyloid oligomers appear to be more compact enclosed structures, some of which are thought to be composed of antiparallel β-sheets comprising β-hairpins. β-Hairpins are special because their twisted shape, hydrophobic surfaces, and exposed hydrogen-bonding edges impart a unique propensity to form compact assemblies. Our laboratory has developed macrocyclic β-sheets that are designed to mimic β-hairpins formed by amyloidogenic peptides and proteins. The β-hairpin mimics contain two β-strand peptide fragments linked together at their N- and C-termini by two δ-linked ornithine turn mimics to create a macrocycle. An N-methyl group is installed on one of the β-strands to prevent uncontrolled aggregation. These design features facilitate crystallization of the β-hairpin mimics and determination of the X-ray crystallographic structures of the oligomers that they form. During the past few years, our laboratory has elucidated the X-ray crystallographic structures of oligomers formed by β-hairpin mimics derived from Aβ, α-synuclein, and β2-microglobulin. Out of these three amyloidogenic peptides and proteins, the Aβ β-hairpin mimics have provided the most insight into amyloid oligomers. Our studies have revealed a previously undiscovered mode of self-assembly, whereby three Aβ β-hairpin mimics assemble to form a triangular trimer. The triangular trimers are remarkable, because they contain two largely hydrophobic surfaces that pack together with other triangular trimers to form higher-order oligomers, such as hexamers and dodecamers. Some of the dodecamers pack in the crystal lattice to form annular porelike assemblies. Some of the β-hairpin mimics and triangular trimers assemble in solution to form oligomers that recapitulate the crystallographically observed oligomers. These oligomers exhibit toxicity toward neuronally derived cells, recapitulating the toxicity of the oligomers formed by full-length amyloidogenic peptides and proteins. These findings are significant, because they address a gap in understanding the molecular basis of amyloid diseases. We anticipate that these studies will pave the way for developing diagnostics and therapeutics to combat Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and other amyloid diseases.",29508987,PMC5911177,10.1021/acs.accounts.7b00554,51
Alzheimer's disease-induced phagocytic microglia express a specific profile of coding and non-coding RNAs,"Introduction:Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease and the main cause of dementia in the elderly. AD pathology is characterized by accumulation of microglia around the beta-amyloid (Aβ) plaques which assumes disease-specific transcriptional signatures, as for the disease-associated microglia (DAM). However, the regulators of microglial phagocytosis are still unknown.Methods:We isolated Aβ-laden microglia from the brain of 5xFAD mice for RNA sequencing to characterize the transcriptional signature in phagocytic microglia and to identify the key non-coding RNAs capable of regulating microglial phagocytosis. Through spatial sequencing, we show the transcriptional changes of microglia in the AD mouse brain in relation to Aβ proximity.Results:Finally, we show that phagocytic messenger RNAs are regulated by miR-7a-5p, miR-29a-3p and miR-146a-5p microRNAs and segregate the DAM population into phagocytic and non-phagocytic states.Discussion:Our study pinpoints key regulators of microglial Aβ clearing capacity suggesting new targets for future therapeutic approaches.",37828821,PMC10916983,10.1002/alz.13502,1
Methylation as a key regulator of Tau aggregation and neuronal health in Alzheimer's disease,"Neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and Huntington's disease involves abnormal aggregation and accumulation of toxic proteins aggregates. Post-translational modifications (PTMs) of the causative proteins play an important role in the etiology of disease as they could either slow down or accelerate the disease progression. Alzheimer disease is associated with the aggregation and accumulation of two major protein aggregates-intracellular neurofibrillary tangles made up of microtubule-associated protein Tau and extracellular Amyloid-β plaques. Post-translational modifications are important for the regulation of Tau`s function but an imbalance in PTMs may lead to abnormal Tau function and aggregation. Tau methylation is one of the important PTM of Tau in its physiological state. However, the methylation signature on Tau lysine changes once it acquires pathological aggregated form. Tau methylation can compete with other PTMs such as acetylation and ubiquitination. The state of PTM at these sites determines the fate of Tau protein in terms of its function and stability. The global methylation in neurons, microglia and astrocytes are involved in multiple cellular functions involving their role in epigenetic regulation of gene expression via DNA methylation. Here, we have discussed the effect of methylation on Tau function in a site-specific manner and their cross-talk with other lysine modifications. We have also elaborated the role of methylation in epigenetic aspects and neurodegenerative conditions associated with the imbalance in methylation metabolism affecting global methylation state of cells.

The vicious circle of hypometabolism in neurodegenerative diseases: Ways and mechanisms of metabolic correction,"Hypometabolism, characterized by decreased brain glucose consumption, is a common feature of many neurodegenerative diseases. Initial hypometabolic brain state, created by characteristic risk factors, may predispose the brain to acquired epilepsy and sporadic Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases, which are the focus of this review. Analysis of available data suggests that deficient glucose metabolism is likely a primary initiating factor for these diseases, and that resulting neuronal dysfunction further promotes the metabolic imbalance, establishing an effective positive feedback loop and a downward spiral of disease progression. Therefore, metabolic correction leading to the normalization of abnormalities in glucose metabolism may be an efficient tool to treat the neurological disorders by counteracting their primary pathological mechanisms. Published and preliminary experimental results on this approach for treating Alzheimer's disease and epilepsy models support the efficacy of metabolic correction, confirming the highly promising nature of the strategy. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",28463438,,10.1002/jnr.24064,91
Current Status and Challenges of Stem Cell Treatment for Alzheimer's Disease,"Neurodegenerative diseases called tauopathies, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), frontotemporal dementia, progressive supranuclear palsy, and Parkinson's disease, among others, are characterized by the pathological processing and accumulation of tau protein. AD is the most prevalent neurodegenerative disease and is characterized by two lesions: neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) and neuritic plaques. The presence of NFTs in the hippocampus and neocortex in early and advanced stages, respectively, correlates with the patient's cognitive deterioration. So far, no drugs can prevent, decrease, or limit neuronal death due to abnormal pathological tau accumulation. Among potential non-pharmacological treatments, physical exercise has been shown to stimulate the development of stem cells (SCs) and may be useful in early stages. However, this does not prevent neuronal death from the massive accumulation of NFTs. In recent years, SCs therapies have emerged as a promising tool to repopulate areas involved in cognition in neurodegenerative diseases. Unfortunately, protocols for SCs therapy are still being developed and the mechanism of action of such therapy remains unclear. In this review, we show the advances and limitations of SCs therapy. Finally, we provide a critical analysis of its clinical use for AD.",34633316,PMC8673502,10.3233/JAD-200863,5
Role of neurotoxicants in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease: a mechanistic insight,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most conspicuous chronic neurodegenerative syndrome, which has become a significant challenge for the global healthcare system. Multiple studies have corroborated a clear association of neurotoxicants with AD pathogenicity, such as Amyloid beta (Aβ) proteins and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), signalling pathway modifications, cellular stress, cognitive dysfunctions, neuronal apoptosis, neuroinflammation, epigenetic modification, and so on. This review, therefore, aimed to address several essential mechanisms and signalling cascades, including Wnt (wingless and int.) signalling pathway, autophagy, mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), protein kinase C (PKC) signalling cascades, cellular redox status, energy metabolism, glutamatergic neurotransmissions, immune cell stimulations (e.g. microglia, astrocytes) as well as an amyloid precursor protein (APP), presenilin-1 (PSEN1), presenilin-2 (PSEN2) and other AD-related gene expressions that have been pretentious and modulated by the various neurotoxicants. This review concluded that neurotoxicants play a momentous role in developing AD through modulating various signalling cascades. Nevertheless, comprehension of this risk agent-induced neurotoxicity is far too little. More in-depth epidemiological and systematic investigations are needed to understand the potential mechanisms better to address these neurotoxicants and improve approaches to their risk exposure that aid in AD pathogenesis.Key messagesInevitable cascade mechanisms of how Alzheimer's Disease-related (AD-related) gene expressions are modulated by neurotoxicants have been discussed.Involvement of the neurotoxicants-induced pathways caused an extended risk of AD is explicited.Integration of cell culture, animals and population-based analysis on the clinical severity of AD is addressed.",34433343,PMC8405119,10.1080/07853890.2021.1966088,4
The potential utility of smell testing to screen for neurodegenerative disorders,"Introduction:Loss of smell is a common early feature of neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease. Identifying these conditions in their early stages is important to understand more about early pathophysiological events and the development of disease modifying therapies. Smell testing may be an effective future tool for screening large populations for early neurodegeneration.Areas covered:In this review, we appraise the evidence for, and discuss the likelihood of, the use of smell testing in large screening programs to detect early neurodegeneration. We evaluate the predictive power of smell tests for neurodegenerative disease, compare performance to other established screening programs, and discuss ethical and practical considerations and limitations.Expert opinion:Even if disease modifying therapies were available for neurodegenerative disease, smell tests alone are unlikely to have high enough predictive power to be used in a future screening program. However, we believe they could be a valuable component of a short battery of tests or part of a stepwise process that together could more accurately identify early neurodegeneration in large populations.",35129037,,10.1080/14737159.2022.2037424,0
Potential of astrocytes in targeting therapy for Alzheimer's disease,"As the most common neurodegenerative disease, Alzheimer's disease (AD) exhibits an incomprehensible pathogenesis, which has led to the continuous failure of drug development in recent years. Although neuronal damage is considered a pathological feature of AD, treatment strategies targeting β-amyloid (Aβ) have not achieved beneficial effects. In-depth research on glial cells has revealed the strong importance and application prospects of astrocytes in the recovery of cognitive functions. This review summarizes the role of astrocytes in AD and the possibility of therapeutic strategies targeting astrocytes. Astrocytes are involved in brain lipid metabolism and can regulate the synthesis and degradation of Aβ to affect the pathology of AD. The tau protein is phosphorylated by astrocytes, and this phosphorylation leads to the formation of neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs). Astrocytes can express a variety of receptors and inflammatory factors and participate in the neuroinflammatory process and the release of proinflammatory mediators. When the glutamate produced by the neurons is not cleared by astrocytes, neurons undergo apoptosis due to blocked cell metabolism. Therapies for astrocytes are highly efficient, and these include stem cell therapy, gene editing technology, astrocyte transformation and chemical drugs. Here, we discuss the advantages and disadvantages of animal and cell models applied to the study of targeted astrocyte therapies. This study helps elucidate the mechanism of astrocytes in AD and promotes the clinical application of potential therapeutic strategies targeting astrocytes.",36330912,,10.1016/j.intimp.2022.109368,1
"Protein aggregation and neurodegeneration in prototypical neurodegenerative diseases: Examples of amyloidopathies, tauopathies and synucleinopathies","Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases are the most prevalent neurodegenerative diseases that generate important health-related direct and indirect socio-economic costs. They are characterized by severe neuronal losses in several disease-specific brain regions associated with deposits of aggregated proteins. In Alzheimer's disease, β-amyloid peptide-containing plaques and intraneuronal neurofibrillary tangles composed of hyperphosphorylated microtubule-associated protein tau are the two main neuropathological lesions, while Parkinson's disease is defined by the presence of Lewy Bodies that are intraneuronal proteinaceous cytoplasmic inclusions. α-Synuclein has been identified as a major protein component of Lewy Bodies and heavily implicated in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease. In the past few years, evidence has emerged to explain how these aggregate-prone proteins can undergo spontaneous self-aggregation, propagate from cell to cell, and mediate neurotoxicity. Current research now indicates that oligomeric forms are probably the toxic species. This article discusses recent progress in the understanding of the pathogenesis of these diseases, with a focus on the underlying mechanisms of protein aggregation, and emphasizes the pathophysiological molecular mechanisms leading to cellular toxicity. Finally, we present the putative direct link between β-amyloid peptide and tau in causing toxicity in Alzheimer's disease as well as α-synuclein in Parkinson's disease, along with some of the most promising therapeutic strategies currently in development for those incurable neurodegenerative disorders.",26209472,,10.1016/j.pneurobio.2015.07.003,81
Asparagine endopeptidase is an innovative therapeutic target for neurodegenerative diseases,"Introduction:Asparagine endopeptidase (AEP) is a pH-dependent endolysosomal cysteine protease that cleaves its substrates after asparagine residues. Our most recent study identifies that it possesses the delta-secretase activity, and that it is implicated in numerous neurological diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) and stroke. Accumulating evidence supports that the inhibition of AEP exhibits beneficial effects for treating these devastating diseases.Areas covered:Based on recent evidence, it is clear that AEP cleaves its substrate, such as amyloid precursor protein (APP), tau and SET, and plays a critical role in neuronal cell death in various neurodegenerative diseases and stroke. In this article, the basic biology of AEP, its knockout phenotypes in mouse models, its substrates in neurodegenerative diseases, and its small peptidyl inhibitors and prodrugs are discussed. In addition, we discuss the potential of AEP as a novel therapeutic target for neurodegenerative diseases.Expert opinion:AEP plays a unique role in numerous biological processes, depending on both pH and context. Most striking is our most recent finding; that AEP is activated in an age-dependent manner and simultaneously cleaves both APP and tau, thereby unifying both major pathological events in AD. Thus, AEP acts as an innovative trigger for neurodegenerative diseases. Inhibition of AEP will provide a disease-modifying treatment for neurodegenerative diseases including AD.",27115710,PMC5315368,10.1080/14728222.2016.1182990,27
"Genetic and Transcriptomic Profiles of Inflammation in Neurodegenerative Diseases: Alzheimer, Parkinson, Creutzfeldt-Jakob and Tauopathies","Polymorphisms in certain inflammatory-related genes have been identified as putative differential risk factors of neurodegenerative diseases with abnormal protein aggregates, such as sporadic Alzheimer's disease (AD) and sporadic Parkinson's disease (sPD). Gene expression studies of cytokines and mediators of the immune response have been made in post-mortem human brain samples in AD, sPD, sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (sCJD) subtypes MM1 and VV2, Pick's disease (PiD), progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) and frontotemporal lobar degeneration linked to mutation P301L in MAPT Frontotemporal lobar degeneration-tau (FTLD-tau). The studies have disclosed variable gene regulation which is: (1) disease-dependent in the frontal cortex area 8 in AD, sPD, sCJD MM1 and VV2, PiD, PSP and FTLD-tau; (2) region-dependent as seen when comparing the entorhinal cortex, orbitofrontal cortex, and frontal cortex area 8 (FC) in AD; the substantia nigra, putamen, FC, and angular gyrus in PD, as well as the FC and cerebellum in sCJD; (3) genotype-dependent as seen considering sCJD MM1 and VV2; and (4) stage-dependent as seen in AD at different stages of disease progression. These observations show that regulation of inflammation is much more complicated and diverse than currently understood, and that new therapeutic approaches must be designed in order to selectively act on specific targets in particular diseases and at different time points of disease progression.",26861289,PMC4783939,10.3390/ijms17020206,41
Herbal Therapeutics for Alzheimer's Disease: Ancient Indian Medicine System from the Modern Viewpoint,"Alzheimer's is a chronic neurodegenerative disease where amyloid-beta (Aβ) plaques and neurofibrillary tangles are formed inside the brain. It is also characterized by progressive memory loss, depression, neuroinflammation, and derangement of other neurotransmitters. Due to its complex etiopathology, current drugs have failed to completely cure the disease. Natural compounds have been investigated as an alternative therapy for their ability to treat Alzheimer's disease (AD). Traditional herbs and formulations which are used in the Indian ayurvedic system are rich sources of antioxidant, anti-amyloidogenic, neuroprotective, and anti-inflammatory compounds. They promote quality of life by improving cognitive memory and rejuvenating brain functioning through neurogenesis. A rich knowledge base of traditional herbal plants (Turmeric, Gingko, Ashwagandha, Shankhpushpi, Giloy, Gotu kola, Garlic, Tulsi, Ginger, and Cinnamon) combined with modern science could suggest new functional leads for Alzheimer's drug discovery. In this article Ayurveda, the ancient Indian herbal medicine system based on multiple clinical and experimental, evidence have been reviewed for treating AD and improving brain functioning. This article presents a modern perspective on the herbs available in the ancient Indian medicine system as well as their possible mechanisms of action for AD treatment. The main objective of this research is to provide a systematic review of herbal drugs that are easily accessible and effective for the treatment of AD.",36797613,PMC10227917,10.2174/1570159X21666230216094353,1
Potential of fluorescent nanoprobe in diagnosis and treatment of Alzheimer's disease,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is well known for its insidious nature, slow progression and high incidence as a neurodegenerative disease. In the past, diagnosis of AD mainly depended on analysis of a patient's cognitive ability and behavior. Without a unified standard for analysis methods, this is prone to produce incorrect diagnoses. Currently, definitive diagnosis mainly relies on histopathological examination. Because of the advantages of precision, noninvasiveness, low toxicity and high spatiotemporal resolution, fluorescent nanoprobes are suitable for the early diagnosis of AD. This review summarizes the research progress of different kinds of fluorescent nanoprobes for AD diagnosis and therapy in recent years and provides an outlook on the development prospects of fluorescent nanoprobes.",36154269,,10.2217/nnm-2022-0022,2
Decoding Causal Links Between Sleep Apnea and Alzheimer's Disease,"Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) are two common chronic diseases with a well-documented association. Whether the association is causal has been highlighted by recent evidence reporting a neurobiological link between these disorders. This narrative review discusses the brain regions and networks involved in OSA as potential vulnerable areas for the development of AD neuropathology with a particular focus on gender-related implications. Using a neuroimaging perspective supported by neuropathological investigations, we provide a new model of neurodegeneration common to OSA and AD, that we have called OSA-AD neurodegeneration in order to decode the causal links between these two chronic conditions.",33459636,,10.3233/JAD-201066,5
Research Progress in Predicting DNA Methylation Modifications and the Relation with Human Diseases,"DNA methylation is an important mode of regulation in epigenetic mechanisms, and it is one of the research foci in the field of epigenetics. DNA methylation modification affects a series of biological processes, such as eukaryotic cell growth, differentiation, and transformation mechanisms, by regulating gene expression. In this review, we systematically summarized the DNA methylation databases, prediction tools for DNA methylation modification, machine learning algorithms for predicting DNA methylation modification, and the relationship between DNA methylation modification and diseases such as hypertension, Alzheimer's disease, diabetic nephropathy, and cancer. An in-depth understanding of DNA methylation mechanisms can promote accurate prediction of DNA methylation modifications and the treatment and diagnosis of related diseases.",34533438,,10.2174/0929867328666210917115733,5
The engagement of microglia in tau-targeted immunotherapy in Alzheimer's disease,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an age-related neurodegenerative disease characterized by progressive memory decline, histopathological lesions such as amyloid β plaques and neurofibrillary tangles, and neuroinflammation driven by glial cells. Microglia, the innate immune cells of the brain, dynamically survey their environment for signs of infection and cell damage. Although our understanding of microglia and their modes of activation has expanded in recent years, their role in AD is still not completely understood. Broad range of microglia phenotypes, from neuroinflammatory to neuroprotective, found in neurodegenerative diseases make their role difficult to discern. In this review, we summarize activities of microglia in healthy and AD brains and their possible role during immunotherapy targeted against pathological tau proteins.",34897021,,10.4149/gpb_2021029,0
Gut Microbiota Composition and Epigenetic Molecular Changes Connected to the Pathogenesis of Alzheimer's Disease,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder, and its pathogenesis is not fully known. Although there are several hypotheses, such as neuroinflammation, tau hyperphosphorylation, amyloid-β plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, and oxidative stress, none of them completely explain the origin and progression of AD. Emerging evidence suggests that gut microbiota and epigenetics can directly influence the pathogenesis of AD via their effects on multiple pathways, including neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, and amyloid protein. Various gut microbes such as Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, E. coli, Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, Tenericutes, and Verrucomicrobia are known to play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of AD. These microbes and their metabolites modulate various physiological processes that contribute to AD pathogenesis, such as neuroinflammation and other inflammatory processes, amyloid deposition, cytokine storm syndrome, altered BDNF and NMDA signaling, impairing neurodevelopmental processes. Likewise, epigenetic markers associated with AD mainly include histone modifications and DNA methylation, which are under the direct control of a variety of enzymes, such as acetylases and methylases. The activity of these enzymes is dependent upon the metabolites generated by the host's gut microbiome, suggesting the significance of epigenetics in AD pathogenesis. It is interesting to know that both gut microbiota and epigenetics are dynamic processes and show a high degree of variation according to diet, stressors, and environmental factors. The bidirectional relation between the gut microbiota and epigenetics suggests that they might work in synchrony to modulate AD representation, its pathogenesis, and progression. They both also provide numerous targets for early diagnostic biomarkers and for the development of AD therapeutics. This review discusses the gut microbiota and epigenetics connection in the pathogenesis of AD and aims to highlight vast opportunities for diagnosis and therapeutics of AD.",33829390,,10.1007/s12031-021-01829-3,20
Prion-like mechanisms and potential therapeutic targets in neurodegenerative disorders,"Prion-like propagation of abnormal intracytoplasmic proteins, which are the defining features of major neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), has been proposed. A growing body of evidence strongly suggests that abnormal tau, α-synuclein and TDP-43 have prion-like properties, convert the corresponding normal proteins into abnormal forms, and are transmitted from cell to cell, spreading throughout the brain. This idea is extremely important not only for understanding the pathogenesis and progression of these diseases, but also for the development of molecular therapies. Since the distributions and spreading of the abnormal proteins are closely associated with disease symptoms and progression, gain-of-toxic-function of these proteins may affect the neurons and glial cells either directly or indirectly, or both. It is essential to regulate the aggregation of abnormal intracellular proteins and their cell-to-cell transmission in order to stop, or at least slow, the progression of these diseases.",27916654,,10.1016/j.pharmthera.2016.11.010,34
Developing Effective Alzheimer's Disease Therapies: Clinical Experience and Future Directions,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) clinical trials, focused on disease modifying drugs and conducted in patients with mild to moderate AD, as well as prodromal (early) AD, have failed to reach efficacy endpoints in improving cognitive function in most cases to date or have been terminated due to adverse events. Drugs that have reached clinical stage were reviewed using web resources (such as clinicaltrials.gov, alzforum.org, company press releases, and peer reviewed literature) to identify late stage (Phase II and Phase III) efficacy clinical trials and summarize reasons for their failure. For each drug, only the latest clinical trials and ongoing trials that aimed at improving cognitive function were included in the analysis. Here we highlight the potential reasons that have hindered clinical success, including clinical trial design and choice of outcome measures, heterogeneity of patient populations, difficulties in diagnosing and staging the disease, drug design, mechanism of action, and toxicity related to the long-term use. We review and suggest approaches for AD clinical trial design aimed at improving our ability to identify novel therapies for this devastating disease.",31476157,PMC6839593,10.3233/JAD-190507,45
"A review on nonviral, nonbacterial infectious agents toxicity involved in neurodegenerative diseases","Neuronal death, decreased activity or dysfunction of neurotransmitters are some of the pathophysiological reasons for neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and multiple sclerosis. Also, there is evidence for the role of infections and infectious agents in neurodegenerative diseases and the effect of some metabolites in microorganisms in the pathophysiology of these diseases. In this study, we intend to evaluate the existing studies on the role of infectious agents and their metabolites on the pathophysiology of neurodegenerative diseases. PubMed, Scopus, Google Scholar and Web of Science search engines were searched. Some infectious agents have been observed in neurodegenerative diseases. Also, isolations of some fungi and microalgae have an improving effect on Parkinson's and Alzheimer's.",38357803,,10.2217/nmt-2023-0004,0
Modulation of Mitochondrial Function as a Therapeutic Strategy for Neurodegenerative Diseases,"Despite recent FDA approval of anti-amyloid antibodies for Alzheimer's Disease, strategies that target early molecular mechanisms and could delay or change the disease trajectory are still needed. Mitochondria emerge as a signaling organelle that could modulate multiple molecular mechanisms to enhance cellular bioenergetics and promote neuronal survival. Approaches to enhance mitochondrial function could promote healthy aging delaying the onset of age-related diseases such as Alzheimer's Disease. Some of these strategies have been recently tested in clinical trials. Emerging evidence demonstrates that in response to mild energetic stress, mitochondria could orchestrate a robust adaptive stress response activating multiple neuroprotective mechanism. The objective of this review is to highlight recent development of mitochondria-targeting therapeutics for neurodegenerative diseases, mitochondria complex I inhibitors in particular.",37874088,,10.14283/jpad.2023.108,1
Alzheimer's disease: insights from a network medicine perspective,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disease that currently lacks available effective therapy. Thus, identifying novel molecular biomarkers for diagnosis and treatment of AD is urgently demanded. In this study, we exploited tools and concepts of the emerging research area of Network Medicine to unveil a novel putative disease gene signature associated with AD. We proposed a new pipeline, which combines the strengths of two consolidated algorithms of the Network Medicine: DIseAse MOdule Detection (DIAMOnD), designed to predict new disease-associated genes within the human interactome network; and SWItch Miner (SWIM), designed to predict important (switch) genes within the co-expression network. Our integrated computational analysis allowed us to enlarge the set of the known disease genes associated to AD with additional 14 genes that may be proposed as new potential diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets for AD phenotype.",36207441,PMC9546925,10.1038/s41598-022-20404-3,1
[Relationship between Oral Microbiota and Alzheimer's Disease],"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a common neurodegenerative disease. In an aging society, the high prevalence of AD and the low quality of life of AD patients create serious problems for individuals, families and the society. However, the etiology and pathogenesis of AD are still not fully understood. Age, genetics, environment and other factors are all relevant to AD, and treatment has not achieved satisfactory results. Recent studies have found that oral dysbiosis is closely related to the pathogenesis of AD, and that oral bacterial infection may be one of the causes of AD. Oral cavity is the largest microbial ecosystem of human body, and its homeostasis is critical to health. Bacterial infections caused by oral dysbiosis can directly and indirectly induce the metabolic imbalance of amyloid β-protein (Aβ) in the brain and the hyperphosphorylation of Tau protein. Then, the precipitation forms senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) that damage neurons. Based on the latest research findings, we herein discussed the correlation between oral microbiota and the pathogenesis of AD and the mechanisms involved, as well as the pathogenic mechanism of main oral bacteria. In addition, we explored the potential application prospects of oral microbiota-targeted therapy.",35332717,PMC10409350,10.12182/20220360304,0
[The role of mercury and arsenic in the etiology and pathogenesis of Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases],"A critical review of literature data on the toxic effects of mercury and arsenic on the human brain and their relationship with the etiology and pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases is presented. In the first case, the toxic effect of mercury and arsenic on the brain stimulates oxidative stress, which leads to the formation of free oxygen species and a decrease in the antioxidant defense of neurons. In the second case, the harmful effect of mercury changes the structure and properties of β-amyloid, and the toxic effect of arsenic contributes to its accumulation. In the pathogenesis of the diseases under consideration, particular importance is attached to the reaction of astrocytes that initiate neuroinflammation, which is also characteristic of mercury and arsenic intoxication. Considering that the symptoms recorded during intoxication with mercury and arsenic are in many respects similar to those of Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases, and their pathogenetic mechanisms (oxidative stress and neuroinflammation) coincide, then the toxic effects of mercury and arsenic in neurodegenerative diseases analyzed in this review can be characterized as the influence of the most significant risk factors.",36178224,,10.17116/patol20228405159,1
α-synuclein as an emerging pathophysiological biomarker of Alzheimer's disease,"Introduction:α-syn aggregates represent the pathological hallmark of synucleinopathies as well as a frequent copathology (almost 1/3 of cases) in AD. Recent research indicates a potential role of α-syn species, measured in CSF with conventional analytical techniques, in the differential diagnosis between AD and synucleinopathies (such as DLB). Pioneering studies report the detection of α-syn in blood, however, conclusive investigations are controversial. Ultrasensitive seed amplification techniques, enabling the selective quantification of α-syn seeds, may represent an effective solution to identify the α-syn component in AD and facilitate a biomarker-guided stratification.Areas covered:We performed a PubMed-based review of the latest findings on α-syn-related biomarkers for AD, focusing on bodily fluids. A dissertation on the role of ultrasensitive seed amplification assays, detecting α-syn seeds from different biological samples, was conducted.Expert opinion:α-syn may contribute to progressive AD neurodegeneration through cross-seeding especially with tau protein. Ultrasensitive seed amplification techniques may support a biomarker-drug co-development pathway and may be a pathophysiological candidate biomarker for the evolving ATX(N) system to classify AD and the spectrum of primary NDDs. This would contribute to a precise approach to AD, aimed at implementing disease-modifying treatments.",35443850,,10.1080/14737159.2022.2068952,2
A Scoping Review of Neuromodulation Techniques in Neurodegenerative Diseases: A Useful Tool for Clinical Practice?,"Background and Objectives:Neurodegenerative diseases that typically affect the elderly such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease and frontotemporal dementia are typically characterised by significant cognitive impairment that worsens significantly over time. To date, viable pharmacological options for the cognitive symptoms in these clinical conditions are lacking. In recent years, various studies have employed neuromodulation techniques to try and contrast patients' decay.Materials and Methods: We conducted an in-depth literature review of the state-of-the-art of the contribution of these techniques across these neurodegenerative diseases.Results: The present review reports that neuromodulation techniques targeting cognitive impairment do not allow to draw yet any definitive conclusion about their clinical efficacy although preliminary evidence is very encouraging.Conclusions: Further and more robust studies should evaluate the potentialities and limitations of the application of these promising therapeutic tools to neurodegenerative diseases.",33673455,PMC7997187,10.3390/medicina57030215,5
Retinal Alterations Predict Early Prodromal Signs of Neurodegenerative Disease,"Neurodegenerative diseases are an increasingly common group of diseases that occur late in life with a significant impact on personal, family, and economic life. Among these, Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD) are the major disorders that lead to mild to severe cognitive and physical impairment and dementia. Interestingly, those diseases may show onset of prodromal symptoms early after middle age. Commonly, the evaluation of these neurodegenerative diseases is based on the detection of biomarkers, where functional and structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) have shown a central role in revealing early or prodromal phases, although it can be expensive, time-consuming, and not always available. The aforementioned diseases have a common impact on the visual system due to the pathophysiological mechanisms shared between the eye and the brain. In Parkinson's disease, α-synuclein deposition in the retinal cells, as well as in dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra, alters the visual cortex and retinal function, resulting in modifications to the visual field. Similarly, the visual cortex is modified by the neurofibrillary tangles and neuritic amyloid β plaques typically seen in the Alzheimer's disease brain, and this may reflect the accumulation of these biomarkers in the retina during the early stages of the disease, as seen in postmortem retinas of AD patients. In this light, the ophthalmic evaluation of retinal neurodegeneration could become a cost-effective method for the early diagnosis of those diseases, overcoming the limitations of functional and structural imaging of the deep brain. This analysis is commonly used in ophthalmic practice, and interest in it has risen in recent years. This review will discuss the relationship between Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease with retinal degeneration, highlighting how retinal analysis may represent a noninvasive and straightforward method for the early diagnosis of these neurodegenerative diseases.",38338966,PMC10855697,10.3390/ijms25031689,0
Tryptamine: A privileged scaffold for the management of Alzheimer's disease,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a chronic and irreversible neurodegenerative disease associated with aging. It is characterized by the progressive loss of memory and other cognitive functions. Although the exact etiology of AD is not well explored, several factors, such as the deposition of amyloid-β (Aβ) plaques, hyperphosphorylation of tau protein, presence of low levels of acetylcholine, and generation of oxidative stress, are key mediators in the progression of AD. Currently, the clinical treatment options for AD are limited and are based on cholinesterase (ChE) inhibitors (e.g., donepezil, rivastigmine, and galantamine), N-methyl- d-aspartic acid receptor antagonists (e.g., memantine), and the recently approved Aβ modulator (e.g., aducanumab). Tryptamine (2-(1H-indol-3-yl)ethan-1-amine) is a small molecule that contains an indole nucleus and an ethylamine side chain. It is also the active metabolite of tryptophan. It possesses a wide range of biological activities related to neurodegenerative disorders, such as ChE inhibition, Aβ aggregation inhibition, antioxidant effects, monoamine-oxidase inhibition, and neuroprotection. Several tryptamine-based hybrid analogs are currently being investigated as multifunctional agents for the development of novel hybrids for AD treatment. Thus, this review article aims to provide in-depth insights into the research progress and strategies for designing multifunctional agents used in Alzheimer's therapy.",37675624,,10.1002/ddr.22111,1
The emerging relationship between vitamin K and neurodegenerative diseases: a review of current evidence,"Neurodegenerative disease refers to a group of disorders that predominantly damage the neurons in the brain. Despite significant progress in the knowledge of neurodegenerative diseases, there is currently no disease-modifying drug available. Vitamin K was first established for its involvement in blood clotting, but there is now compelling evidence indicating its role in the neurological system. In particular, the results of recent studies on the effects of vitamin K2 on preventing apoptosis, oxidative stress, and microglial activation in neuron cells through its role in electron transport are very promising against Alzheimer's disease. In addition to its protective effect on cognitive functions, its inhibitory effects on inflammation and α-synuclein fibrillization in Parkinson's disease, which has been revealed in recent years, are remarkable. Although there are many studies on the mechanism and possible treatment methods of neurodegenerative diseases, especially Parkinson's and Alzheimer's disease, studies on the relationship between vitamin K and neurodegenerative diseases are very limited, yet have promising findings. Vitamin K has also been proposed for therapeutic use in multiple sclerosis patients to lower the intensity or to slow down the progression of the disease. Accordingly, the aim of this study is to review the current evidence for the use of vitamin K supplementation in neurodegenerative diseases, in particular Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and multiple sclerosis.",36329336,,10.1007/s11033-022-07925-w,4
Precision medicine: Clarity for the clinical and biological complexity of Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases,"The goal of precision medicine is to deliver optimally targeted and timed interventions tailored to an individual's molecular drivers of disease. This concept has wide currency in cancer care and in some diseases caused by monogenetic mutations, such as cystic fibrosis, and recently has been endorsed by the White House Office of Science and Technology for more widespread application in medicine. Here we describe our vision of how precision medicine can bring greater clarity to the clinical and biological complexity of the two most common neurodegenerative diseases, Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease.",25941321,PMC4419342,10.1084/jem.20150656,13
Late-Onset Alcohol Abuse as a Presenting Symptom of Neurodegenerative Diseases,"Background:The association between lifetime alcohol abuse and a higher risk to develop dementia is well known. However, it is unknown whether older adults who begin abusing alcohol late in life have an underlying neurodegenerative disease.Objective:Identify the frequency of lifelong alcohol abuse (L-AA), late-onset alcohol abuse (LO-AA), and alcohol abuse as a first symptom of dementia (AA-FS) in patients with neurodegenerative diseases.Methods:Cross-sectional retrospective study of patients evaluated at an academic referral center with a clinical diagnosis of behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD), Alzheimer-type dementia (AD), and semantic variant primary progressive aphasia (svPPA) (n = 1,518). The presence of alcohol abuse was screened with the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center questionnaire. L-AA was defined as onset < 40 years, LO-AA as onset ≥40 years, and AA-FS was defined when the abuse started within the first three years from symptom onset.Results:The frequency of LO-AA was 2.2% (n = 33/1,518). LO-AA was significantly more frequent in patients with bvFTD than AD (7.5%, n = 13/173 versus 1.3%, n = 16/1,254, CI:1.0;11.4%), but not svPPA (4.4%, n = 4/91, CI: -4.4;10.7%). Similarly, AA-FS was more frequent in bvFTD patients than AD (5.7%, n = 10/173 versus 0.7%, n = 9/1,254, CI:0.5%;9.5%), but not svPPA (2.2%, n = 2/91, CI:-2.4;9.1%).Conclusion:LO-AA can be a presenting symptom of dementia, especially bvFTD. Alcohol abuse onset later in life should prompt a clinical investigation into the possibility of an underlying neurodegenerative process because delay in diagnosis and treatment may increase patient and caregiver burden. The results need to be interpreted with caution due to the limitations of the study.",35180118,PMC9090138,10.3233/JAD-215369,0
Abnormal Glucose Metabolism in Alzheimer's Disease: Relation to Autophagy/Mitophagy and Therapeutic Approaches,"Diminished glucose metabolism accompanies many neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's disease. An understanding of the relation of these metabolic changes to the disease will enable development of novel therapeutic strategies. Following a metabolic challenge, cells generally conserve energy to preserve viability. This requires activation of many cellular repair/regenerative processes such as mitophagy/autophagy and fusion/fission. These responses may diminish cell function in the long term. Prolonged fission induces mitophagy/autophagy which promotes repair but if prolonged progresses to mitochondrial degradation. Abnormal glucose metabolism alters protein signaling including the release of proteins from the mitochondria or migration of proteins from the cytosol to the mitochondria or nucleus. This overview provides an insight into the different mechanisms of autophagy/mitophagy and mitochondrial dynamics in response to the diminished metabolism that occurs with diseases, especially neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease. The review discusses multiple aspects of mitochondrial responses including different signaling proteins and pathways of mitophagy and mitochondrial biogenesis. Improving cellular bioenergetics and mitochondrial dynamics will alter protein signaling and improve cellular/mitochondrial repair and regeneration. An understanding of these changes will suggest new therapeutic strategies.",26077923,PMC4674363,10.1007/s11064-015-1631-0,20
Treatment of Neurodegeneration: Integrating Photobiomodulation and Neurofeedback in Alzheimer's Dementia and Parkinson's: A Review,"Objective:A review of photobiomodulation (PBM) in Alzheimer's dementia is submitted. The addition of PBM in neurodegenerative diseases is a dual modality that is at present gaining traction as it is safe, antiviral, and anti-inflammatory for treating neurodegeneration with photons that stimulate mitochondria increasing adenosine triphosphate and proteasomes increasing misfolded protein removal. Neurofeedback provides neural plasticity with an increase in brain-derived nerve factor mRNA and an increase in dendrite production and density in the hippocampus coupled with overall growth in dendrites, density, and neuronal survival.Background:Alzheimer's disease pathophysiology is the accumulation of hyperphosphorylated tau protein neurofibrillary tangles and subsequently amyloid-beta (Aβ) plaques. PBM and neurobiofeedback (NBF)address the multiple gene expression and upregulation of multiple pathogenic pathway inflammation, reactive oxidative stress, mitochondrial disorders, insulin resistance, methylation defects, regulation of neuroprotective factors, and regional hypoperfusion of the brain. There is no human evidence to suggest a clinical therapeutic benefit from using consistent light sources while significantly increasing safety concerns.Methods:A PBM test with early- to mid-Alzheimer's was reported in 2017, consisting of a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in a small pilot group of early- to mid-dementia subjects under Institutional Review Board (IRB)-approved Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Clinical Trial.Results:PBM-treated subjects showed that active treatment subjects tended to show greater improvement in the functioning of the executive: clock drawing, immediate recall, practical memory, and visual attention and task switching (Trails A&B). A larger study using the CerebroLite helmet in Temple Texas again of subjects in a double-blind, placebo-controlled IRB-approved FDA Clinical Trial demonstrated gain in memory and cognition by increased clock drawing.Conclusions:Next-generation trials with the Cognitolite for Parkinson's disease subjects will incorporate the insights regarding significant bilateral occipital hypocoherence deficits gained from the quantitative EEG analyses. Future applications will integrate noninvasive stimulation delivery, including full-body and transcranial and infrared light with pulsed electromagnetic frequencies.",31647776,,10.1089/photob.2019.4685,17
The emerging roles of protein homeostasis-governing pathways in Alzheimer's disease,"Pathways governing protein homeostasis are involved in maintaining the structural, quantitative, and functional stability of intracellular proteins and involve the ubiquitin-proteasome system, autophagy, endoplasmic reticulum, and mTOR pathway. Due to the broad physiological implications of protein homeostasis pathways, dysregulation of proteostasis is often involved in the development of multiple pathological conditions, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). Similar to other neurodegenerative diseases that feature pathogenic accumulation of misfolded proteins, Alzheimer's disease is characterized by two pathological hallmarks, amyloid-β (Aβ) plaques and tau aggregates. Knockout or transgenic overexpression of various proteostatic components in mice results in AD-like phenotypes. While both Aβ plaques and tau aggregates could in turn enhance the dysfunction of these proteostatic pathways, eventually leading to apoptotic or necrotic neuronal death and pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. Therefore, targeting the components of proteostasis pathways may be a promising therapeutic strategy against Alzheimer's disease.",29992725,PMC6156496,10.1111/acel.12801,51
Neuroepigenetics and Alzheimer's Disease: An Update,"Epigenetics is the study of changes in gene expression which may be triggered by both genetic and environmental factors, and independent from changes to the underlying DNA sequence-a change in phenotype without a change in genotype-which in turn affects how cells read genes. Epigenetic changes represent a regular and natural occurrence but can be influenced also by factors such as age, environment, and disease state. Epigenetic modifications can manifest themselves not only as the manner in which cells terminally differentiate, but can have also deleterious effects, resulting in diseases such as cancer. At least three systems including DNA methylation, histone modification, and non-coding RNA (ncRNA)-associated gene silencing are thought to initiate and sustain epigenetic change. For example, in Alzheimer's disease (AD), both genetic and non-genetic factors contribute to disease etiopathology. While over 250 gene mutations have been related to familial AD, less than 5% of AD cases are explained by known disease genes. More than likely, non-genetic factors, probably triggered by environmental factors, are causative factors of late-onset AD. AD is associated with dysregulation of DNA methylation, histone modifications, and ncRNAs. Among the classes of ncRNA, microRNAs (miRNAs) have a well-established regulatory relevance. MicroRNAs are highly expressed in CNS neurons, where they play a major role in neuron differentiation, synaptogenesis, and plasticity. MicroRNAs impact higher cognitive functions, as their functional impairment is involved in the etiology of neurological diseases, including AD. Alterations in the miRNA network contribute to AD disease processes, e.g., in the regulation of amyloid peptides, tau, lipid metabolism, and neuroinflammation. MicroRNAs, both as biomarkers for AD and therapeutic targets, are in the early stages of exploration. In addition, emerging data suggest that altered transcription of long ncRNAs, endogenous, ncRNAs longer than 200 nucleotides, may be involved in an elevated risk for AD.",29991138,,10.3233/JAD-180259,13
Natural Products from Plants and Algae for Treatment of Alzheimer's Disease: A Review,"Neurodegenerative disorders including Parkinson's disease (PD), Huntington's disease (HD) and the most frequent, Alzheimer's disease (AD), represent one of the most urgent medical needs worldwide. Despite a significantly developed understanding of disease development and pathology, treatments that stop AD progression are not yet available. The recent approval of sodium oligomannate (GV-971) for AD treatment in China emphasized the potential value of natural products for the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders. Many current clinical studies include the administration of a natural compound as a single and combination treatment. The most prominent mechanisms of action are anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative activities, thus preserving cellular survival. Here, we review current natural products that are either approved or are in testing for a treatment of neurodegeneration in AD. In addition to the most important compounds of plant origin, we also put special emphasis on compounds from algae, given their neuroprotective activity and their underlying mechanisms of neuroprotection.",35625622,PMC9139049,10.3390/biom12050694,5
Potential importance of B cells in aging and aging-associated neurodegenerative diseases,"Our understanding of B cells as merely antibody producers is slowly changing. Alone or in concert with antibody, they control outcomes of seemingly different diseases such as cancer, rheumatoid arthritis, diabetes, and multiple sclerosis. While their role in activation of effector immune cells is beneficial in cancer but bad in autoimmune diseases, their immunosuppressive and regulatory subsets (Bregs) inhibit autoimmune and anticancer responses. These pathogenic and suppressive functions are not static and appear to be regulated by the nature and strength of inflammation. Although aging increases inflammation and changes the composition and function of B cells, surprisingly, little is known whether the change affects aging-associated neurodegenerative disease, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). Here, by analyzing B cells in cancer and autoimmune and neuroinflammatory diseases, we elucidate their potential importance in AD and other aging-associated neuroinflammatory diseases.",28083646,PMC8011659,10.1007/s00281-016-0615-8,12
The multifaceted functions of β-arrestins and their therapeutic potential in neurodegenerative diseases,"Arrestins are multifunctional proteins that regulate G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) desensitization, signaling, and internalization. The arrestin family consists of four subtypes: visual arrestin1, β-arrestin1, β-arrestin2, and visual arrestin-4. Recent studies have revealed the multifunctional roles of β-arrestins beyond GPCR signaling, including scaffolding and adapter functions, and physically interacting with non-GPCR receptors. Increasing evidence suggests that β-arrestins are involved in the pathogenesis of a variety of neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), frontotemporal dementia (FTD), and Parkinson's disease (PD). β-arrestins physically interact with γ-secretase, leading to increased production and accumulation of amyloid-beta in AD. Furthermore, β-arrestin oligomers inhibit the autophagy cargo receptor p62/SQSTM1, resulting in tau accumulation and aggregation in FTD. In PD, β-arrestins are upregulated in postmortem brain tissue and an MPTP model, and the β2AR regulates SNCA gene expression. In this review, we aim to provide an overview of β-arrestin1 and β-arrestin2, and describe their physiological functions and roles in neurodegenerative diseases. The multifaceted roles of β-arrestins and their involvement in neurodegenerative diseases suggest that they may serve as promising therapeutic targets.",38212557,PMC10834518,10.1038/s12276-023-01144-4,0
New Approaches to Profile the Microbiome for Treatment of Neurodegenerative Disease,"Progressive neurodegenerative diseases represent some of the largest growing treatment challenges for public health in modern society. These diseases mainly progress due to aging and are driven by microglial surveillance and activation in response to changes occurring in the aging brain. The lack of efficacious treatment options for Alzheimer's disease (AD), as the focus of this review, and other neurodegenerative disorders has encouraged new approaches to address neuroinflammation for potential treatments. Here we will focus on the increasing evidence that dysbiosis of the gut microbiome is characterized by inflammation that may carry over to the central nervous system and into the brain. Neuroinflammation is the common thread associated with neurodegenerative diseases, but it is yet unknown at what point and how innate immune function turns pathogenic for an individual. This review will address extensive efforts to identify constituents of the gut microbiome and their neuroactive metabolites as a peripheral path to treatment. This approach is still in its infancy in substantive clinical trials and requires thorough human studies to elucidate the metabolic microbiome profile to design appropriate treatment strategies for early stages of neurodegenerative disease. We view that in order to address neurodegenerative mechanisms of the gut, microbiome and metabolite profiles must be determined to pre-screen AD subjects prior to the design of specific, chronic titrations of gut microbiota with low-dose antibiotics. This represents an exciting treatment strategy designed to balance inflammatory microglial involvement in disease progression with an individual's manifestation of AD as influenced by a coercive inflammatory gut.",34219718,,10.3233/JAD-210198,4
Role of Neuroinflammation in the Trajectory of Alzheimer's Disease and in vivo Quantification Using PET,"Recent evidence suggests that neuroinflammation and immunity play a significant role in Alzheimer's disease and other neurodegenerative diseases. It has also been observed that, independent of the presence of aggregated proteins, neuroinflammation could be present in different neurodegenerative diseases. It has also been suggested that neuroinflammation could occur well ahead of amyloid deposition in AD. Recent genetic studies and other preclinical studies specifically point to a role of neuroinflammation and, in this review, we evaluate the evidence of neuroinflammation in the Alzheimer's disease trajectory and the different imaging modalities by which we could monitor neuroinflammation in vivo in humans.",29865053,,10.3233/JAD-179929,16
"The Role of Reactive Oxygen Species in the Pathogenesis of Alzheimer's Disease, Parkinson's Disease, and Huntington's Disease: A Mini Review","Neurodegenerative diseases affect not only the life quality of aging populations, but also their life spans. All forms of neurodegenerative diseases have a massive impact on the elderly. The major threat of these brain diseases includes progressive loss of memory, Alzheimer's disease (AD), impairments in the movement, Parkinson's disease (PD), and the inability to walk, talk, and think, Huntington's disease (HD). Oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction are highlighted as a central feature of brain degenerative diseases. Oxidative stress, a condition that occurs due to imbalance in oxidant and antioxidant status, has been known to play a vital role in the pathophysiology of neurodegenerative diseases including AD, PD, and HD. A large number of studies have utilized oxidative stress biomarkers to investigate the severity of these neurodegenerative diseases and medications are available, but these only treat the symptoms. In traditional medicine, a large number of medicinal plants have been used to treat the symptoms of these neurodegenerative diseases. Extensive studies scientifically validated the beneficial effect of natural products against neurodegenerative diseases using suitable animal models. This short review focuses the role of oxidative stress in the pathogenesis of AD, PD, and HD and the protective efficacy of natural products against these diseases.",28116038,PMC5223034,10.1155/2016/8590578,182
Recent Advances on the Role of Neurogenesis in the Adult Brain: Therapeutic Potential in Parkinson's and Alzheimer's Diseases,"Background:Generation of nascent functional neurons from neural stem cells in the adult brain has recently become largely accepted by the neuroscience community. In adult mammals including humans, the process of neurogenesis has been well documented in two brain regions; the subventricular zone of the lateral ventricles and the subgranular zone in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus.Method:Some evidence has indicated neurogenesis in other regions of the adult mammalian brain such as the neocortex, cerebellum, striatum, amygdala and hypothalamus. These discoveries question a long standing dogma on nervous system regeneration and provide medical science with potential new strategies to harness the process of neurogenesis for treating neurological disabilities and neurodegenerative diseases.Conclusion:In this current review, we address the most recent advances on the role of neurogenesis in the adult brain and therapeutic potential in the two most common neurodegenerative disorders, Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases.",28641510,,10.2174/1871527316666170623094728,12
The potential of psychedelics for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias,"Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is a currently incurable but increasingly prevalent fatal and progressive neurodegenerative disease, demanding consideration of therapeutically relevant natural products and their synthetic analogues. This paper reviews evidence for effectiveness of natural and synthetic psychedelics in the treatment of AD causes and symptoms. The plastogenic effects of serotonergic psychedelics illustrate that they have efficacy for addressing multiple facets of AD pathology. We review findings illustrating neuroplasticity mechanisms of classic (serotonergic) and non-classic psychedelics that indicate their potential as treatments for AD and related dementias. Classic psychedelics modulate glutamatergic neurotransmission and stimulate synaptic and network remodeling that facilitates synaptic, structural and behavioral plasticity. Up-regulation of neurotrophic factors enable psychedelics to promote neuronal survival and glutamate-driven neuroplasticity. Muscimol modulation of GABAAR reduces Aβ-induced neurotoxicity and psychedelic Sig-1R agonists provide protective roles in Aβ toxicity. Classic psychedelics also activate mTOR intracellular effector pathways in brain regions that show atrophy in AD. The potential of psychedelics to treat AD involves their ability to induce structural and functional neural plasticity in brain circuits and slow or reverse brain atrophy. Psychedelics stimulate neurotrophic pathways, increase neurogenesis and produce long-lasting neural changes through rewiring pathological neurocircuitry. Psychedelic effects on 5-HT receptor target genes and induction of synaptic, structural, and functional changes in neurons and networks enable them to promote and enhance brain functional connectivity and address diverse mechanisms underlying degenerative neurological disorders. These findings provide a rationale for immediate investigation of psychedelics as treatments for AD patients.",37451163,,10.1016/j.euroneuro.2023.07.003,4
Complex and differential glial responses in Alzheimer's disease and ageing,"Glial cells and their association with neurones are fundamental for brain function. The emergence of complex neurone-glial networks assures rapid information transfer, creating a sophisticated circuitry where both types of neural cells work in concert, serving different activities. All glial cells, represented by astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, microglia and NG2-glia, are essential for brain homeostasis and defence. Thus, glia are key not only for normal central nervous system (CNS) function, but also to its dysfunction, being directly associated with all forms of neuropathological processes. Therefore, the progression and outcome of neurological and neurodegenerative diseases depend on glial reactions. In this review, we provide a concise account of recent data obtained from both human material and animal models demonstrating the pathological involvement of glia in neurodegenerative processes, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), as well as physiological ageing.",26923267,,10.2174/1567205013666160229112911,38
Current Views on the Role of Stress in the Pathogenesis of Chronic Neurodegenerative Diseases,"The review summarizes the results of studies on the cellular and molecular mechanisms mediating the impact of stress on the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative brain pathologies (Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, etc.) and presents current information on the role of stress in the hyperphosphorylation of tau protein, aggregation of beta-amyloid, and hyperactivation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis involved in the hyperproduction of factors that contribute to the pathogenetic role of stress in neurodegeneration. The data on the participation of microglia in the effects of stress on the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases are presented.",34225596,,10.1134/S0006297921060110,0
Going around in circles: deciphering the role of circular RNAs in neurodegenerative disease,"Purpose of review:Circular RNAs are highly expressed in the brain, accumulate with ageing and may play important functional roles. Hence, their role in age-related neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease, is under active investigation. This review provides an overview of our current knowledge regarding the roles of circular RNAs in Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease.Recent findings:More studies have examined Alzheimer's disease than Parkinson's disease. Circular RNA 7 (ciRS-7) has been implicated in both diseases and may play a causative pathological role in at least Alzheimer's disease. The identification of circular RNA interaction networks is a primary focus. However, different analysis pipelines can generate quite disparate results, hence bioinformatically identified candidate circular RNAs require experimental and functional validation.Summary:Although this field of research is in its infancy, rapid advances holds promise for identifying circular RNAs that are important in neurodegenerative diseases. CiRS-7 is a promising candidate for further examination. More studies are required focussing not only on Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease but also on other neurodegenerative diseases. Whether circular RNAs can be used to inform diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic strategies for age-related neurodegenerative disease remains unclear.",31895158,,10.1097/YCO.0000000000000582,9
Advancements in the Application of Nanomedicine in Alzheimer's Disease: A Therapeutic Perspective,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease that affects most people worldwide. AD is a complex central nervous system disorder. Several drugs have been designed to cure AD, but with low success rates. Because the blood-brain and blood-cerebrospinal fluid barriers are two barriers that protect the central nervous system, their presence has severely restricted the efficacy of many treatments that have been studied for AD diagnosis and/or therapy. The use of nanoparticles for the diagnosis and treatment of AD is the focus of an established and rapidly developing field of nanomedicine. Recent developments in nanomedicine have made it possible to effectively transport drugs to the brain. However, numerous obstacles remain to the successful use of nanomedicines in clinical settings for AD treatment. Furthermore, given the rapid advancement in nanomedicine therapeutics, better outcomes for patients with AD can be anticipated. This article provides an overview of recent developments in nanomedicine using different types of nanoparticles for the management and treatment of AD.",37762346,PMC10530821,10.3390/ijms241814044,3
Anosognosia in patients with Alzheimer's disease: current perspectives,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease characterised by neurocognitive impairments, especially memory impairment, as core symptoms linked to reductions in activities of daily life. As marginal symptoms, neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPSs) appear during the progressive course of the disease. A lack of self-awareness (anosognosia) of cognitive and functional impairments is often seen in patients with AD, and associations between anosognosia and other NPSs have been previously reported. To account for anosognosia pathogenesis neurocognitively, the cognitive awareness model (CAM) has been helpful for explaining the stream of events from sensory input to behavioural/affective and metacognitive outputs. According to CAM, there are three types of anosognosia: (i) primary anosognosia, (ii) executive anosognosia, and (iii) mnemonic anosognosia. These types of anosognosia are generated from different neurocognitive modulations leading to metacognitive outputs or behavioural/affective regulations. Primary anosognosia is considered to be caused by deficits in the metacognitive awareness system (MAS). While preserved MAS function is associated with milder depression and anxiety in AD, a severer depressive mood in patients with mild AD can inversely cause self-underestimation. The modulation of executive anosognosia is thought to be associated with dangerous/disinhibition behaviours and apathy among NPS sub-symptoms, via impairments of comparator mechanism (Cm) within the central executive system. Other neurobehavioral reactions linked to self-awareness include 'denying' and 'confabulation', and each of these reactions is thought to be affected by the MAS and a Cm. Denial of one's own memory impairments appears as a defensive reaction to protect against dysphoric feelings, and the confabulatory comment is instantly reaction constructed by fabrications according to misinterpretations of memory information about oneself. Similarly, the innovative development of a theoretical model (CAM) has contributed to explaining the mechanism of anosognosia and some neurobehavioral outputs from a neurocognitive perspective.",31930617,,10.1111/psyg.12507,10
Epigenomic analysis of Alzheimer's disease brains reveals diminished CTCF binding on genes involved in synaptic organization,"Epigenetic aberrations are suggested to play an important role in transcriptional alterations in Alzheimer's disease (AD). One of the key mechanisms of epigenetic regulation of gene expression is through the dynamic organization of chromatin structure via the master genome architecture protein, CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF). By forming chromatin loops, CTCF can influence gene transcription in a complex manner. To find out whether genome-wide DNA binding sites for CTCF are altered in AD, we compared CTCF chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-Seq) data from frontal cortex of human AD patients and normal controls (n = 9 pairs, all females). We have revealed that CTCF-binding affinity on many genes is significantly reduced in AD patients, and these genes are enriched in synaptic organization, cell adhesion, and actin cytoskeleton, including synaptic scaffolding molecules and receptors, such as SHANK2, HOMER1, NRXN1, CNTNAP2 and GRIN2A, and protocadherin (PCDH) and cadherin (CDH) family members. By comparing transcriptomic data from AD patients, we have discovered that many of the synaptic and adhesion genes with reduced CTCF binding in AD are significantly reduced in their mRNA expression. Moreover, a significant overlap of genes with the diminished CTCF binding and the reduced H3K27ac is identified in AD, with the common genes enriched in synaptic organization. These data suggest that the CTCF-controlled 3D chromatin organization is perturbed in AD, which may be linked to the diminished expression of target genes, probably through changes in histone modification.",37302762,PMC10519202,10.1016/j.nbd.2023.106192,3
Molecularly imprinted polymers for the recognition of biomarkers of certain neurodegenerative diseases,"The appearance of the biomarkers in body fluids like blood, urine, saliva, tears, etc. can be used for the identification of many diseases. This article aimed to summarize the studies about electrochemical biosensors with molecularly imprinted polymers as sensitive and selective layers on the electrode to detect protein-based biomarkers of such neurodegenerative diseases as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and stress. The main attention in this article is focused on the detection methods of amyloid-β oligomers and p-Tau which are representative biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease, α-synuclein as the biomarker of Parkinson's disease, and α-amylase and lysozyme as the biomarkers of stress using molecular imprinting technology. The research methods, the application of different electrodes, the influence of the polymers, and the established detection limits are reviewed and compared.",36934618,,10.1016/j.jpba.2023.115343,5
Recent studies on cellular and molecular mechanisms in Alzheimer's disease: focus on epigenetic factors and histone deacetylase,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is one of the most common neurodegenerative disorders mainly affecting elderly people. It is characterized by progressive loss of memory and cognitive function. More than 95% of AD cases are related to sporadic or late-onset AD (LOAD). The etiology of LOAD is still unclear. It has been reported that environmental factors and epigenetic alterations play a significant role in AD pathogenesis. Furthermore, recently, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) identified 10 novel risk genes: ABCA7, APOE, BIN1, CD2AP, CD33, CLU, CR1, MS4A6A, MS4A4E, and PICALM, which play an important role for LOAD. In this review, the therapeutic approaches of AD by epigenetic modifications have been discussed. Nowadays, HDAC inhibitors have clinically proven its activity for epigenetic modifications. Furthermore, we try to establish the relationship between HDAC inhibitors and above mentioned LOAD risk genes. Finally, we are hoping that this review may open new area of research for AD treatment.",29397389,,10.1515/revneuro-2017-0049,15
Blood biomarker-based classification study for neurodegenerative diseases,"As the population ages, neurodegenerative diseases are becoming more prevalent, making it crucial to comprehend the underlying disease mechanisms and identify biomarkers to allow for early diagnosis and effective screening for clinical trials. Thanks to advancements in gene expression profiling, it is now possible to search for disease biomarkers on an unprecedented scale.Here we applied a selection of five machine learning (ML) approaches to identify blood-based biomarkers for Alzheimer's (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD) with the application of multiple feature selection methods. Based on ROC AUC performance, one optimal random forest (RF) model was discovered for AD with 159 gene markers (ROC-AUC = 0.886), while one optimal RF model was discovered for PD (ROC-AUC = 0.743). Additionally, in comparison to traditional ML approaches, deep learning approaches were applied to evaluate their potential applications in future works. We demonstrated that convolutional neural networks perform consistently well across both the Alzheimer's (ROC AUC = 0.810) and Parkinson's (ROC AUC = 0.715) datasets, suggesting its potential in gene expression biomarker detection with increased tuning of their architecture.",37821485,PMC10567903,10.1038/s41598-023-43956-4,1
The Future of Cognitive Screening in Neurodegenerative Diseases,"Cognitive screening instruments (CSI) have variable sensitivity and specificity to the cognitive changes associated with dementia syndromes, and the most recent systematic review found insufficient evidence to support the benefit of cognitive screening tools in older adults residing within the community. Consequently, there is a critical need to improve CSI methods, which have not yet incorporated advances in psychometrics, neuroscience, and technology. The primary goal of this article is to provide a framework for transitioning from legacy CSIs to advanced dementia screening measurement. In line with ongoing efforts in neuropsychology and the call for next-generation digital assessment for early detection of AD, we propose a psychometrically advanced (including application of item response theory methods), automated selective assessment model that provides a framework to help propel an assessment revolution. Further, we present a three-phase model for modernizing CSIs and discuss critical diversity and inclusion issues, current challenges in differentiating normal from pathological aging, and ethical considerations.",36970899,,10.3233/JAD-221077,0
Impact of Cognitive Priming on Alzheimer's Disease,"Alzheimer's disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disease which spreads increasingly, and subjective cognitive decline (SCD) is an early state of this disease. With the absence of efficient pharmacological treatment, non-pharmacological treatments may be the solution to slow down the progress of the disease. We propose a cognitive priming system in which we ask patients about several celebrity names and then we project the name of the forgotten ones. The projection is very fast (29 ms) in a way only the subconscious part of the patients' brain could intercept it. Two experiments with different SCD patients have been done. In the first one, the participants received cognitive priming projections, and in the second one, as a control group, they did not. Results show that the cognitive priming method works with SCD patients and that we can restore some missing memory using this technique. In addition, results show that the effect of the cognitive priming can last 1 month or more.",37486494,,10.1007/978-3-031-31982-2_21,0
"Protective Effects of Flavonoids against Alzheimer's Disease: Pathological Hypothesis, Potential Targets, and Structure-Activity Relationship","Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease with high morbidity and mortality, for which there is no available cure. Currently, it is generally believed that AD is a disease caused by multiple factors, such as amyloid-beta accumulation, tau protein hyperphosphorylation, oxidative stress, and inflammation. Multitarget prevention and treatment strategies for AD are recommended. Interestingly, naturally occurring dietary flavonoids, a class of polyphenols, have been reported to have multiple biological activities and anti-AD effects in several AD models owing to their antioxidative, anti-inflammatory, and anti-amyloidogenic properties. In this review, we summarize and discuss the existing multiple pathogenic factors of AD. Moreover, we further elaborate on the biological activities of natural flavonoids and their potential mode of action and targets in managing AD by presenting a wide range of experimental evidence. The gathered data indicate that flavonoids can be regarded as prophylactics to slow the advancement of AD or avert its onset. Different flavonoids have different activities and varying levels of activity. Further, this review summarizes the structure-activity relationship of flavonoids based on the existing literature and can provide guidance on the design and selection of flavonoids as anti-AD drugs.",36077418,PMC9456554,10.3390/ijms231710020,8
Endo-lysosomal dysfunction in neurodegenerative diseases: opinion on current progress and future direction in the use of exosomes as biomarkers,"Over the past two decades, increased research has highlighted the connection between endosomal trafficking defects and neurodegeneration. The endo-lysosomal network is an important, complex cellular system specialized in the transport of proteins, lipids, and other metabolites, essential for cell homeostasis. Disruption of this pathway is linked to a wide range of neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Huntington's disease and frontotemporal dementia. Furthermore, there is strong evidence that defects in this pathway create opportunities for diagnostic and therapeutic intervention. In thisOpinionpiece, we concisely address the role of endo-lysosomal dysfunction in five neurodegenerative diseases and discuss how future research can investigate this intracellular pathway, including extracellular vesicles with a specific focus on exosomes for the identification of novel disease biomarkers. This article is part of a discussion meeting issue 'Understanding the endo-lysosomal network in neurodegeneration'.",38368936,PMC10874701,10.1098/rstb.2022.0387,2
Recent Advancements in Nanomaterials: A Promising Way to Manage Neurodegenerative Disorders,"Neurodegenerative diseases (NDs) such as dementia, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, frontotemporal dementia, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis are some of the most prevalent disorders currently afflicting healthcare systems. Many of these diseases share similar pathological hallmarks, including elevated oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, protein misfolding, excitotoxicity, and neuroinflammation, all of which contribute to the deterioration of the nervous system's structure and function. The development of diagnostic and therapeutic materials in the monitoring and treatment of these diseases remains challenging. One of the biggest challenges facing therapeutic and diagnostic materials is the blood-brain barrier (BBB). The BBB is a multifunctional membrane possessing a plethora of biochemical, cellular, and immunological features that ensure brain homeostasis by preventing the entry and accumulation of unwanted compounds. With regards to neurodegenerative diseases, the recent application of tailored nanomaterials (nanocarriers and nanoparticles) has led to advances in diagnostics and therapeutics. In this review, we provide an overview of commonly used nanoparticles and their applications in NDs, which may offer new therapeutic strategies for the prevention and treatment of neurodegenerative diseases.",37217723,,10.1007/s40291-023-00654-1,2
Is There a Shared Etiology of Olfactory Impairments in Normal Aging and Neurodegenerative Disease?,"As we age, our olfactory function declines. In addition to occurring in normal aging, more rapid decrement of olfactory decline has been associated with several neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD). It has been argued that since olfactory deficits occur less frequently or are absent in diseases such as progressive supranuclear palsy, corticobasal degeneration, and multiple system atrophy, olfactory deficits can be used for differential diagnoses of AD and PD. The purpose of this review is to provide a survey of current knowledge about the molecular bases and differential patterns of olfactory deficits present in normal aging, AD, and PD. As substantial research has been conducted in this area, the majority of the content of this review focuses on articles published in the past decade. We hypothesize that olfactory deficits in normal aging, AD, and PD may have different underlying causes, and propose the use of model organisms with small, tractable nervous systems and/or easy to manipulate genomes to further investigate the cellular mechanisms responsible for these deficits.",31744002,,10.3233/JAD-190636,7
Targeting Novel microRNAs in Developing Novel Alzheimer's Disease Treatments,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is considered a multifactorial disease and a significant cause of dementia during aging. This neurodegenerative disease process is classically divided into two different pathologies cerebral accumulation of amyloid-β and hyperphosphorylated neurofibrillary tau tangles. In recent years, massive efforts have been made to treat AD by decreasing amyloid-β and tau in the brains of patients with AD, with no success. The dysfunction of a wide range of microRNAs promotes the generation and insufficient clearance of amyloid-β (Aβ) and increases tau plaques which are the pathophysiological markers of AD. Disturbance of these microRNAs is associated with mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative damage, inflammation, apolipoprotein E4 (APOE4) pathogenic process, synaptic loss, and cognitive deficits induced by AD. Targeting a specific microRNA to restore AD-induced impairments at multiple stages might provide a promising approach for developing new drugs and therapeutic strategies for patients with AD. This review focuses on different mechanisms of microRNAs in AD pathophysiology.",36048350,,10.1007/s11064-022-03734-6,2
Exosome Biomarkers Revolutionize Preclinical Diagnosis of Neurodegenerative Diseases and Assessment of Treatment Responses in Clinical Trials,"Alzheimer's disease and other neurodegenerative diseases have long preclinical phases with active and progressively irreversible pathology. Therefore, biomarkers are essential for identifying patients early in the course of these diseases, when they may benefit the most from disease-modifying interventions. A limitation of biomarkers measured in the soluble phase of blood is their tenuous link to brain pathology. A new approach to biomarker discovery that addresses this limitation is deriving extracellular vesicles (EVs) enriched for neuronal and astrocytic origin from peripheral blood. EVs are membranous particles (subdivided into smaller exosomes and larger microvesicles) that are shed by all cells and found in all biofluids. Neuronal and astrocytic EVs have been implicated in the pathogenesis of several neurodegenerative diseases. Given their origin, neuronal and astrocytic enriched EVs harvested from blood can be used to interrogate brain pathologic processes previously inaccessible in vivo. In a long series of case control studies based on these EV subpopulations, we have identified candidate protein biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease and other neurodegenerative diseases. In GeNeDis 2018, an update of these studies and results from a validation study of these biomarkers in preclinical Alzheimer's disease will be presented. In addition, we will present results from studies demonstrating EV biomarker responses to experimental interventions. EV-based biomarkers are a valuable new tool that will enable researchers to test hypotheses in proof of concept studies with carefully selected participants at the preclinical phase, spearheading therapeutic discovery in neurodegenerative disease.",32468469,,10.1007/978-3-030-32633-3_19,14
Exploring the nexus of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias with cancer and cancer therapies: A convening of the Alzheimer's Association & Alzheimer's Drug Discovery Foundation,"Recent population studies suggest an intriguing inverse relationship between several types of cancer and neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease. Understanding the intersection of the underlying biology for these two distinct families of diseases with one another may offer novel approaches to identify new therapeutic approaches and possible opportunities to repurpose existing drug candidates. The Alzheimer's Association and the Alzheimer's Drug Discovery Foundation convened a one-day workshop to delve into this discussion. Workshop participants outlined research focus areas, potential collaborations, and partnerships for future action.",27998721,PMC5548424,10.1016/j.jalz.2016.11.002,20
[The role of aluminum and lead in the development of Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases],"The article summarizes the data available in the literature on the toxic effects of aluminum and lead on the human brain and assesses the relationship of these effects to the etiopathogenesis of the most common neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. The accumulation of ions of these metals in the brain structures leads to chronic intoxication that is manifested by the morphological signs that are typical for Alzheimer's disease, such as deposits of β-amyloid and τ-protein mainly in the frontal and temporal regions of the cortex, and for Parkinson's disease, such as degeneration of dopamine neurons in the substantia nigra and their accumulation of α-synuclein. The most likely forms of participation of aluminum and lead ions in the mechanisms of neurodegeneration are the replacement of bivalent metal ions necessary for brain functioning, oxidative stress initiation, epigenetic modifications of histones, and increased expression of noncoding ribonucleic acids.",34041898,,10.17116/patol20218303156,0
"Emerging pathways to neurodegeneration: Dissecting the critical molecular mechanisms in Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease","Neurodegenerative diseases are usually sporadic in nature and commonly influenced by a wide range of genetic, life style and environmental factors. A unifying feature of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD) is the abnormal accumulation and processing of mutant or damaged intra and extracellular proteins; this leads to neuronal vulnerability and dysfunction in the brain. Through a detailed review of ubiquitin proteasome, mRNA splicing, mitochondrial dysfunction, and oxidative stress pathway interrelation on neurodegeneration can improve the understanding of the disease mechanism. The identified pathways common to AD and PD nominate promising new targets for further studies, and as well as biomarkers. These insights suggested would likely provide major stimuli for developing unified treatment approaches to combat neurodegeneration. More broadly, pathways can serve as vehicles for integrating findings from diverse studies of neurodegeneration. The evidence examined in this review provides a brief overview of the current literature on significant pathways in promoting in AD, PD. Additionally, these insights suggest that biomarkers and treatment strategies may require simultaneous targeting of multiple components.",30612001,,10.1016/j.biopha.2018.12.101,44
Targeting Age-Related Neurodegenerative Diseases by AAV-Mediated Gene Therapy,"Age-related neurodegenerative diseases have detrimental consequences on health of many patients and result in mortality. The current treatment options are limited and usually fail to correct the underlying pathology. AAV-based gene therapies have proved to be safe based on the data available on clinical trials for several monogenic diseases. Therefore, such therapies can pave the way to treat neurodegenerative diseases likes Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Here, the advantages of AAV-based gene therapies are discussed with emphasis on efforts of developing novel capsids with superior therapeutic efficacy. Furthermore, the results of clinical trials on AD, PD, and ALS are summarized.",33725356,,10.1007/978-3-030-55035-6_15,2
Novel therapeutic strategies for Alzheimer's disease: Implications from cell-based therapy and nanotherapy,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a multifactorial neurodegenerative disease which leads to progressive dysfunction of cognition, memory and learning in elderly people. Common therapeutic agents are not only inadequate to suppress the progression of AD pathogenesis but also produce deleterious side effects; hence, development of alternative therapies is required to specifically suppress complications of AD. The current review provides a commentary on conventional as well as novel therapeutic approaches with an emphasis on stem cell and nano-based therapies for improvement and management of AD pathogenesis. According to our overview of the current literature, AD is a multi-factorial disorder with various pathogenic trajectories; hence, a multifunctional strategy to create effective neuroprotective agents is required to treat this disorder.",31927133,,10.1016/j.nano.2020.102149,16
Current Updates on the Role of MicroRNA in the Diagnosis and Treatment of Neurodegenerative Diseases,"Background:MicroRNAs (miRNA) are small noncoding RNAs that play a significant role in the regulation of gene expression. The literature has explored the key involvement of miRNAs in the diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment of various neurodegenerative diseases (NDD), such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), and Huntington's disease (HD). The miRNA regulates various signalling pathways; its dysregulation is involved in the pathogenesis of NDD.Objective:The present review is focused on the involvement of miRNAs in the pathogenesis of NDD and their role in the treatment or management of NDD. The literature provides comprehensive and cutting-edge knowledge for students studying neurology, researchers, clinical psychologists, practitioners, pathologists, and drug development agencies to comprehend the role of miRNAs in the NDD's pathogenesis, regulation of various genes/signalling pathways, such as α-synuclein, P53, amyloid-β, high mobility group protein (HMGB1), and IL-1β, NMDA receptor signalling, cholinergic signalling, etc. Methods: The issues associated with using anti-miRNA therapy are also summarized in this review. The data for this literature were extracted and summarized using various search engines, such as Google Scholar, Pubmed, Scopus, and NCBI using different terms, such as NDD, PD, AD, HD, nanoformulations of mRNA, and role of miRNA in diagnosis and treatment.Results:The miRNAs control various biological actions, such as neuronal differentiation, synaptic plasticity, cytoprotection, neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, apoptosis and chaperone-mediated autophagy, and neurite growth in the central nervous system and diagnosis. Various miRNAs are involved in the regulation of protein aggregation in PD and modulating β-secretase activity in AD. In HD, mutation in the huntingtin (Htt) protein interferes with Ago1 and Ago2, thus affecting the miRNA biogenesis. Currently, many anti-sense technologies are in the research phase for either inhibiting or promoting the activity of miRNA.Conclusion:This review provides new therapeutic approaches and novel biomarkers for the diagnosis and prognosis of NDDs by using miRNA.",37861022,,10.2174/0115665232261931231006103234,1
Selective vulnerability in neurodegeneration: insights from clinical variants of Alzheimer's disease,"Selective vulnerability in the nervous system refers to the fact that subpopulations of neurons in different brain systems may be more or less prone to abnormal function or death in response to specific types of pathological states or injury. The concept has been used extensively as a potential way of explaining differences in degeneration patterns and the clinical presentation of different neurodegenerative diseases. Yet the increasing complexity of molecular histopathology at the cellular level in neurodegenerative disorders frequently appears at odds with phenotyping based on clinically-directed, macroscopic regional brain involvement. While cross-disease comparisons can provide insights into the differential vulnerability of networks and neuronal populations, we focus here on what is known about selective vulnerability-related factors that might explain the differential phenotypic expressions of the same disease-in this case, typical and atypical forms of Alzheimer's disease. Whereas considerable progress has been made in this area, much is yet to be elucidated; further studies comparing different phenotypic variants aimed at identifying both vulnerability and resilience factors may provide valuable insights into disease pathogenesis, and suggest novel targets for therapy.",26746185,,10.1136/jnnp-2015-311321,41
"Polypathology and dementia after brain trauma: Does brain injury trigger distinct neurodegenerative diseases, or should they be classified together as traumatic encephalopathy?","Neuropathological studies of human traumatic brain injury (TBI) cases have described amyloid plaques acutely after a single severe TBI, and tau pathology after repeat mild TBI (mTBI). This has helped drive the hypothesis that a single moderate to severe TBI increases the risk of developing late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD), while repeat mTBI increases the risk of developing chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE). In this review we critically assess this position-examining epidemiological and case control human studies, neuropathological evidence, and preclinical data. Epidemiological studies emphasize that TBI is associated with the increased risk of developing multiple types of dementia, not just AD-type dementia, and that TBI can also trigger other neurodegenerative conditions such as Parkinson's disease. Further, human post-mortem studies on both single TBI and repeat mTBI can show combinations of amyloid, tau, TDP-43, and Lewy body pathology indicating that the neuropathology of TBI is best described as a 'polypathology'. Preclinical studies confirm that multiple proteins associated with the development of neurodegenerative disease accumulate in the brain after TBI. The chronic sequelae of both single TBI and repeat mTBI share common neuropathological features and clinical symptoms of classically defined neurodegenerative disorders. However, while the spectrum of chronic cognitive and neurobehavioral disorders that occur following repeat mTBI is viewed as the symptoms of CTE, the spectrum of chronic cognitive and neurobehavioral symptoms that occur after a single TBI is considered to represent distinct neurodegenerative diseases such as AD. These data support the suggestion that the multiple manifestations of TBI-induced neurodegenerative disorders be classified together as traumatic encephalopathy or trauma-induced neurodegeneration, regardless of the nature or frequency of the precipitating TBI.",26091850,PMC4681695,10.1016/j.expneurol.2015.06.015,79
Boosting the autophagy-lysosomal pathway by phytochemicals: A potential therapeutic strategy against Alzheimer's disease,"The lysosome is a membrane-enclosed organelle in eukaryotic cells, which has basic pattern recognition for nutrient-dependent signal transduction. In Alzheimer's disease, the already declining autophagy-lysosomal function is exacerbated by an increased need for clearance of damaged proteins and organelles in aged cells. Recent evidence suggests that numerous diseases are linked to impaired autophagy upstream of lysosomes. In this way, a comprehensive survey on the pathophysiology of the disease seems necessary. Hence, in the first section of this review, we will discuss the ultimate findings in lysosomal signaling functions and how they affect cellular metabolism and trafficking under neurodegenerative conditions, specifically Alzheimer's disease. In the second section, we focus on how natural products and their derivatives are involved in the regulation of inflammation and lysosomal dysfunction pathways, including how these should be considered a crucial target for Alzheimer's disease therapeutics.",32894821,,10.1002/iub.2369,3
The past and present of therapeutic strategy for Alzheimer's diseases: potential for stem cell therapy,"Alzheimer's disease (AD), a progressive neurodegenerative disease characterized by cognitive dysfunction and neuropsychiatric symptoms, is the most prevalent form of dementia among the elderly. Amyloid aggregation, tau hyperphosphorylation, and neural cell loss are the main pathological features. Various hypotheses have been proposed to explain the development of AD. Some therapeutic agents have shown clinical benefits in patients with AD; however, many of these agents have failed. The degree of neural cell loss is associated with the severity of AD. Adult neurogenesis, which governs cognitive and emotional behaviors, occurs in the hippocampus, and some research groups have reported that neural cell transplantation into the hippocampus improves cognitive dysfunction in AD model mice. Based on these clinical findings, stem cell therapy for patients with AD has recently attracted attention. This review provides past and present therapeutic strategies for the management and treatment of AD.",36878603,PMC10435354,10.1538/expanim.22-0164,1
From Neurodegeneration to Brain Health: An Integrated Approach,"The term ""brain health"" integrates general health and well-being with cognitive fitness, in the context of an environment that includes the spectrum of positive and negative factors affecting the individual. Brain health incorporates the effects of neurodegeneration in an ecological sense and the effects of environment and health practices on brain function. It also provides a framework for understanding and maximizing cognitive function across the lifespan. Despite decades of research into the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders, our understanding of how to treat them is relatively rudimentary. Unidimensional approaches, such as medication monotherapies, have generally produced negative results in treatment trials. New integrative paradigms that cut across the molecular and cellular level to the individual and societal level may provide new approaches to understand and treat these disorders. This report on proceedings of a multi-disciplinary conference held in Cleveland, Ohio, in October 2013 summarizes research progress in understanding neurodegenerative disorders in a brain health context. A new ""brain health"" paradigm is essential to finally understand neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease and overcome the relative stand-still in therapeutics research that has characterized the last decade. The authors summarize progress in these emerging areas with the aim of producing new integrated scientific models for understanding brain health, potentially modifying disease course and advancing care for individuals and families affected by neurodegenerative conditions.",25720413,,10.3233/JAD-150043,1
Genetic and epigenetic study of an Alzheimer's disease family with monozygotic triplets,"Age at onset of Alzheimer's disease is highly variable, and its modifiers (genetic or environmental) could act through epigenetic changes, such as DNA methylation at CpG sites. DNA methylation is also linked to ageing-the strongest Alzheimer's disease risk factor. DNA methylation age can be calculated using age-related CpGs and might reflect biological ageing. We conducted a clinical, genetic and epigenetic investigation of a unique Ashkenazi Jewish family with monozygotic triplets, two of whom developed Alzheimer's disease at ages 73 and 76, while the third at age 85 has no cognitive complaints or deficits in daily activities. One of their offspring developed Alzheimer's disease at age 50. Targeted sequencing of 80 genes associated with neurodegeneration revealed that the triplets and the affected offspring are heterozygous carriers of the risk APOE ε4 allele, as well as rare substitutions in APP (p.S198P), NOTCH3 (p.H1235L) and SORL1 (p.W1563C). In addition, we catalogued 52 possibly damaging rare variants detected by NeuroX array in affected individuals. Analysis of family members on a genome-wide DNA methylation chip revealed that the DNA methylation age of the triplets was 6-10 years younger than chronological age, while it was 9 years older in the offspring with early-onset Alzheimer's disease, suggesting accelerated ageing.",31580390,PMC6821163,10.1093/brain/awz289,9
Clinical drug research in chronic central neurodegenerative disorders,"Several compounds developed the treatment of Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease have been clinically unsuccessful. Suggested reasons for these failures have included heterogeneous symptom expression, inappropriate assessment of effects, safety and tolerability hurdles, short duration of disease-modifying trials, recruiting pressure on study centers, administrative and bureaucratic overload, and pooling results from trial centers in different health care systems with differing quality and therapeutic concepts. The solution to these problems will include reducing the costs of drug development, with a concomitant reduction of approval hurdles. Trial designs are influenced by ethics committees, health care officials, political administrations, and research scientists. None have direct contact with the treated patients. Approval of novel therapeutic agents lies in the remit of health care officials, whereby price plays a more dominant role than therapeutic efficacy. Patients and prescribing physicians, however, are better placed to act as arbiters of the efficacy, risks, and overall value of a new drug in practice.",26950806,,10.1586/14737175.2016.1163220,1
A Mendelian Randomization-Based Causal Investigation on Bacterial Infection-Related Genes and Neurodegenerative Diseases,"Neurodegenerative diseases remain the most prevalent and unsolved health problems in human society, especially Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD). The pathogenesis, pathology, and potential clinical treatments of neurodegenerative diseases still require in-depth research. In the wake of the association between pandemics and a growing number of neurodegeneration patients, there has been growing speculation that infections are linked to AD and PD. The Aβ peptide is an important causal-related biomarker of AD and is reported to share structural and functional similarities with certain antimicrobial peptides, suggesting that it has a role in eliciting an immune response against microbes. But how neurodegeneration is related to bacterial chronic infection has not been thoroughly investigated. Using the data from genome-wide association studies (GWAS), we performed Mendelian Randomization (MR) and map 7 genes in multiple bacterial infection pathways as exposure, which show a significant association with the outcome of AD or PD. As co-verification, we perform Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) on selected genetic variants incorporating their perturb-seq gene list (combining single-cell RNA-seq and CRISPR-based perturbations). We observed clustering of the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the upstream and downstream of AD and PD-related KEGG pathways, hence confirming their causal association with AD and PD and providing new perspectives on the true cause of neurodegeneration.",38007792,,10.3233/SHTI230893,0
Amyloid cross-seeding raises new dimensions to understanding of amyloidogenesis mechanism,"Hallmarks of most of the amyloid pathologies are surprisingly found to be heterocomponent entities such as inclusions and plaques which contain diverse essential proteins and metabolites. Experimental studies have already revealed the occurrence of coaggregation and cross-seeding during amyloid formation of several proteins and peptides, yielding multicomponent assemblies of amyloid nature. Further, research reports on the co-occurrence of more than one type of amyloid-linked pathologies in the same individual suggest the possible cross-talk among the disease related amyloidogenic protein species during their amyloid growth. In this review paper, we have tried to gain more insight into the process of coaggregation and cross-seeding during amyloid aggregation of proteins, particularly focusing on their relevance to the pathogenesis of the protein misfolding diseases. Revelation of amyloid cross-seeding and coaggregation seems to open new dimensions in our mechanistic understanding of amyloidogenesis and such knowledge may possibly inspire better designing of anti-amyloid therapeutics.",31430565,,10.1016/j.arr.2019.100937,12
Menopause and development of Alzheimer's disease: Roles of neural glucose metabolism and Wnt signaling,"Late onset Alzheimer´s disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease with gender differences in its onset and progression, being the prevalence predominant in women and at an earlier age than in men. The pathophysiology of the menopausal condition has been associated to this dementia, playing major roles regarding both endocrine and glucose metabolism changes, amongst other mechanisms. In the current review we address the role of estrogen deficiency in the processes involved in the development of AD, including amyloid precursor protein (APP) processing to form senile plaques, Tau phosphorylation forming neurofibrillary tangles, Wnt signaling and AD neuropathology, the role of glucose brain metabolism, Wnt signaling and glucose transport in the brain, and our research contribution to these topics.",36339406,PMC9627150,10.3389/fendo.2022.1021796,3
Abnormal Homocysteine Metabolism: An Insight of Alzheimer's Disease from DNA Methylation,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a chronic neurodegenerative disease in the central nervous system that has complex pathogenesis in the elderly. The current review focuses on the epigenetic mechanisms of AD, according to the latest findings. One of the best-characterized chromatin modifications in epigenetic mechanisms is DNA methylation. Highly replicable data shows that AD occurrence is often accompanied by methylation level changes of the AD-related gene. Homocysteine (Hcy) is not only an intermediate product of one-carbon metabolism but also an important independent risk factor of AD; it can affect the cognitive function of the brain by changing the one-carbon metabolism and interfering with the DNA methylation process, resulting in cerebrovascular disease. In general, Hcy may be an environmental factor that affects AD via the DNA methylation pathway with a series of changes in AD-related substance. This review will concentrate on the relation between DNA methylation and Hcy and try to figure out their rule in the pathophysiology of AD.",32963633,PMC7495165,10.1155/2020/8438602,12
A 20-Year Journey from Axonal Injury to Neurodegenerative Diseases and the Prospect of Immunotherapy for Combating Alzheimer's Disease,"The understanding of the dialogue between the brain and the immune system has undergone dramatic changes over the last two decades, with immense impact on the perception of neurodegenerative diseases, mental dysfunction, and many other brain pathologic conditions. Accumulated results have suggested that optimal function of the brain is dependent on support from the immune system, provided that this immune response is tightly controlled. Moreover, in contrast to the previous prevailing dogma, it is now widely accepted that circulating immune cells are needed for coping with brain pathologies and that their optimal effect is dependent on their type, location, and activity. In this perspective, we describe our own scientific journey, reviewing the milestones in attaining this understanding of the brain-immune axis integrated with numerous related studies by others. We then explain their significance in demonstrating the possibility of harnessing the immune system in a well-controlled manner for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases.",31907265,,10.4049/jimmunol.1900844,10
Evolutionary and genomic perspectives of brain aging and neurodegenerative diseases,"This chapter utilizes genomic concepts and evolutionary perspectives to further understand the possible links between typical brain aging and neurodegenerative diseases, focusing on the two most prevalent of these: Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. Aging is the major risk factor for these neurodegenerative diseases. Researching the evolutionary and molecular underpinnings of aging helps to reveal elements of the typical aging process that leave individuals more vulnerable to neurodegenerative pathologies. Very little is known about the prevalence and susceptibility of neurodegenerative diseases in nonhuman species, as only a few individuals have been observed with these neuropathologies. However, several studies have investigated the evolution of lifespan, which is closely connected with brain size in mammals, and insights can be drawn from these to enrich our understanding of neurodegeneration. This chapter explores the relationship between the typical aging process and the events in neurodegeneration. First, we examined how age-related processes can increase susceptibility to neurodegenerative diseases. Second, we assessed to what extent neurodegeneration is an accelerated form of aging. We found that while at the phenotypic level both neurodegenerative diseases and the typical aging process share some characteristics, at the molecular level they show some distinctions in their profiles, such as variation in genes and gene expression. Furthermore, neurodegeneration of the brain is associated with an earlier onset of cellular, molecular, and structural age-related changes. In conclusion, a more integrative view of the aging process, both from a molecular and an evolutionary perspective, may increase our understanding of neurodegenerative diseases.",36841568,,10.1016/bs.pbr.2022.10.004,2
Human gut microbiota and its association with pathogenesis and treatments of neurodegenerative diseases,"Human gut microbiota consists of various microorganisms whose numbers are similar to those of human cells. Human gut microbes and the brain form bidirectional communications through the brain-gut-axis, and play a central role in normal physiological processes and in pathogenesis of many human diseases. Accumulating evidence has demonstrated the crucial effect of gut microbes in proper brain functions and under disease conditions. Here we first focus on revealing current knowledge of the role of gut microbes in neural development and functions. We then summarize mutual relationships between gut microbes and human diseases, in particular neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease and Multiple sclerosis. Finally, we highlight ongoing studies in exploring gut microbes in treatments of human diseases. Applying gut microbes as a means in treatment of human diseases is becoming a promising research direction, and has a great potential in clinical practice.",33352217,,10.1016/j.micpath.2020.104675,7
A Review of the Pathogenesis and Chinese Medicine Intervention of Alzheimer's Disease,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an age-related neurodegenerative disease that is primary characterized as a cognitive disorder. Its pathology is characterized by the formation of senile plaques in the brain from amyloid-beta (Aβ) aggregation, neuronal fibrillary tangles from hyperphosphorylated tau protein aggregation, prolonged inflammatory responses, and neuronal death. The pathogenesis and clinical manifestations of AD are complex, but aging is generally accepted as one of the most important contributing factors. In addition, there are several hypotheses, including the Aβ hypothesis based on amyloid plaques, the tau hypothesis based on neuronal fiber entanglement, the inflammation hypothesis based on long-term inflammatory responses causing brain damage, and the neuroprotection hypothesis based on synaptic dysfunction and neuronal death. Although the pathogenesis of AD has been broadly classified into four major hypotheses, there are multiple forms of interactions, which is one of the reasons for its complex pathogenesis. Numerous epidemiological studies have shown the important role of genes in AD, followed by brain damage, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, hypertension, and obesity as risk factors for the disease. Despite years of research, several mysteries in AD remain unsolved. Drugs based on various pathogenetic hypotheses are being investigated in large numbers, but the effects are unsatisfactory. In recent years, traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has made excellent progress and is expected to provide a new possibility for AD treatment. In this review, we focus on the latest developments in studies on the risk factors-Aβ aggregates and related factors such as apolipoprotein E, synaptic loss, and fatty acids, and then present the progress in the research of TCM based on the above pathogenesis, intended to provide a research reference and treatment for AD.",36722236,,10.31083/j.jin2201002,2
The six brain-specific TAU isoforms and their role in Alzheimer's disease and related neurodegenerative dementia syndromes,"Introduction:Alternative splicing of the human MAPT gene generates six brain-specific TAU isoforms. Imbalances in the TAU isoform ratio can lead to neurodegenerative diseases, underscoring the need for precise control over TAU isoform balance. Tauopathies, characterized by intracellular aggregates of hyperphosphorylated TAU, exhibit extensive neurodegeneration and can be classified by the TAU isoforms present in pathological accumulations.Methods:A comprehensive review of TAU and related dementia syndromes literature was conducted using PubMed, Google Scholar, and preprint server.Results:While TAU is recognized as key driver of neurodegeneration in specific tauopathies, the contribution of the isoforms to neuronal function and disease development remains largely elusive.Discussion:In this review we describe the role of TAU isoforms in health and disease, and stress the importance of comprehending and studying TAU isoforms in both, physiological and pathological context, in order to develop targeted therapeutic interventions for TAU-associated diseases.Highlights:MAPT splicing is tightly regulated during neuronal maturation and throughout life. TAU isoform expression is development-, cell-type and brain region specific. The contribution of TAU to neurodegeneration might be isoform-specific. Ineffective TAU-based therapies highlight the need for specific targeting strategies.",38556838,PMC11095451,10.1002/alz.13784,0
Spatially informed Bayesian neural network for neurodegenerative diseases classification,"Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) plays an increasingly important role in the diagnosis and prognosis of neurodegenerative diseases. One field of extensive clinical use of MRI is the accurate and automated classification of degenerative disorders. Most of current classification studies either do not mirror medical practice where patients may exhibit early stages of the disease, comorbidities, or atypical variants, or they are not able to produce probabilistic predictions nor account for uncertainty. Also, the spatial heterogeneity of the brain alterations caused by neurodegenerative processes is not usually considered, despite the spatial configuration of the neuronal loss is a characteristic hallmark for each disorder. In this article, we propose a classification technique that incorporates uncertainty and spatial information for distinguishing between healthy subjects and patients from four distinct neurodegenerative diseases: Alzheimer's disease, mild cognitive impairment, Parkinson's disease, and Multiple Sclerosis. We introduce a spatially informed Bayesian neural network (SBNN) that combines a three-dimensional neural network to extract neurodegeneration features from MRI, Bayesian inference to account for uncertainty in diagnosis, and a spatially informed MRI image using hidden Markov random fields to encode cerebral spatial information. The SBNN model demonstrates that classification accuracy increases up to 25% by including a spatially informed MRI scan. Furthermore, the SBNN provides a robust probabilistic diagnosis that resembles clinical decision-making and can account for the heterogeneous medical presentations of neurodegenerative disorders.",36440818,,10.1002/sim.9604,0
Improving Alzheimer's Disease Detection for Speech Based on Feature Purification Network,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease involving the decline of cognitive ability with illness progresses. At present, the diagnosis of AD mainly depends on the interviews between patients and doctors, which is slow, expensive, and subjective, so it is not a better solution to recognize AD using the currently available neuropsychological examinations and clinical diagnostic criteria. A recent study has indicated the potential of language analysis for AD diagnosis. In this study, we proposed a novel feature purification network that can improve the representation learning of transformer model further. Though transformer has made great progress in generating discriminative features because of its long-distance reasoning ability, there is still room for improvement. There exist many common features that are not indicative of any specific class, and we rule out the influence of common features from traditional features extracted by transformer encoder and can get more discriminative features for classification. We apply this method to improve transformer's performance on three public dementia datasets and get improved classification results markedly. Specifically, the method on Pitt datasets gets state-of-the-art (SOTA) result.",35310782,PMC8927695,10.3389/fpubh.2021.835960,2
"Cognitive impairment, neurodegenerative disorders, and olfactory impairment: A literature review","&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Introduction:&lt;/b&gt; The early detection and diagnosis of dementia are of key importance in treatment, slowing disease progression, or suppressing symptoms. The possible role of changes in the sense of smell is considered with regard to potential markers for early detection of Alzheimer's disease (AD).&lt;/br&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Materials and methods:&lt;/b&gt; A literature search was conducted using the electronic databases PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science between May 30, 2022 and August 2, 2022.

Of these articles, 49 were ultimately included in the analysis. The results showed the potential role of changes in the sense of smell as potential biomarkers for early detection of AD. Multiple studies have shown that olfactory impairment may be observed in patients with AD, PD, MCI, or other types of dementia. Even though smell tests are able to detect olfactory loss caused by neurodegenerative diseases, they cannot reliably distinguish between certain diseases.&lt;/br&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/b&gt; In individuals with cognitive impairment or neurodegenerative diseases, olfactory assessment has repeatedly been reported to be used for early diagnosis, but not for differential diagnosis.&lt;/br&gt.",38623856,,10.5604/01.3001.0053.6158,0
Machine Learning and Digital Biomarkers Can Detect Early Stages of Neurodegenerative Diseases,"Neurodegenerative diseases (NDs) such as Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and Parkinson's Disease (PD) are devastating conditions that can develop without noticeable symptoms, causing irreversible damage to neurons before any signs become clinically evident. NDs are a major cause of disability and mortality worldwide. Currently, there are no cures or treatments to halt their progression. Therefore, the development of early detection methods is urgently needed to delay neuronal loss as soon as possible. Despite advancements in Medtech, the early diagnosis of NDs remains a challenge at the intersection of medical, IT, and regulatory fields. Thus, this review explores ""digital biomarkers"" (tools designed for remote neurocognitive data collection and AI analysis) as a potential solution. The review summarizes that recent studies combining AI with digital biomarkers suggest the possibility of identifying pre-symptomatic indicators of NDs. For instance, research utilizing convolutional neural networks for eye tracking has achieved significant diagnostic accuracies. ROC-AUC scores reached up to 0.88, indicating high model performance in differentiating between PD patients and healthy controls. Similarly, advancements in facial expression analysis through tools have demonstrated significant potential in detecting emotional changes in ND patients, with some models reaching an accuracy of 0.89 and a precision of 0.85. This review follows a structured approach to article selection, starting with a comprehensive database search and culminating in a rigorous quality assessment and meaning for NDs of the different methods. The process is visualized in 10 tables with 54 parameters describing different approaches and their consequences for understanding various mechanisms in ND changes. However, these methods also face challenges related to data accuracy and privacy concerns. To address these issues, this review proposes strategies that emphasize the need for rigorous validation and rapid integration into clinical practice. Such integration could transform ND diagnostics, making early detection tools more cost-effective and globally accessible. In conclusion, this review underscores the urgent need to incorporate validated digital health tools into mainstream medical practice. This integration could indicate a new era in the early diagnosis of neurodegenerative diseases, potentially altering the trajectory of these conditions for millions worldwide. Thus, by highlighting specific and statistically significant findings, this review demonstrates the current progress in this field and the potential impact of these advancements on the global management of NDs.",38475108,PMC10934426,10.3390/s24051572,1
Protein Biomarkers for the Diagnosis of Alzheimer's Disease at Different Stages of Neurodegeneration,"Mainly obtained from familial Alzheimer's disease patients' data, we know that some features of the neurodegenerative start several years before the appearance of clinical symptoms. In this brief review, we comment on some molecular and cellular markers appearing at different stages of the disease, before or once the clinical symptoms are evident. These markers are present in biological fluids or could be identified by image techniques. The combined use of molecular and cellular markers will be of interest to determine the development of the different phases of the disease.",32942527,PMC7554800,10.3390/ijms21186749,3
Neovascular Age-Related Macular Degeneration and its Association with Alzheimer's Disease,"In developed countries, people of advanced age go permanently blind most often due to age-related macular degeneration, while at the global level, this disease is the third major cause of blindness, after cataract and glaucoma, according to the World Health Organisation. The number of individuals believed to suffer from the disease throughout the world has been approximated at 50 million. Age-related macular degeneration is classified as non-neovascular (dry, non-exudative) and neovascular (wet, exudative). The exudative form is less common than the non-exudative as it accounts for approximately 10 percent of the cases of the disease. However, it can be much more aggressive and could result in a rapid and severe loss of central vision. Similarly, with age-related macular degeneration, Alzheimer's disease is a late-onset, neurodegenerative disease affecting millions of people worldwide. Both of them are associated with age and share several features, including the presence of abnormal extracellular deposits associated with neuronal degeneration, drusen, and plaques, respectively. The present review article highlights the pathogenesis, clinical features, and imaging modalities used for the diagnosis of neovascular age-related macular degeneration. A thorough overview of the effectiveness of anti-VEGF agents as well as of other treatment modalities that have either lost favour or, are rarely used, is provided in detail. Additionally, the common histologic, immunologic, and pathogenetic features of Alzheimer's disease and age-related macular degeneration are discussed in depth.",31995026,,10.2174/1874609813666200129161833,3
7T MRI for neurodegenerative dementias in vivo: a systematic review of the literature,"The spatial resolution of 7T MRI approaches the scale of pathologies of interest in degenerative brain diseases, such as amyloid plaques and changes in cortical layers and subcortical nuclei. It may reveal new information about neurodegenerative dementias, although challenges may include increased artefact production and more adverse effects. We performed a systematic review of papers investigating Alzheimer's disease (AD), Lewy body dementia (LBD), frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and Huntington's disease (HD) in vivo using 7T MRI. Of 19 studies identified, 15 investigated AD (the majority of which examined hippocampal subfield changes), and 4 investigated HD. Ultrahigh resolution revealed changes not visible using lower field strengths, such as hippocampal subfield atrophy in mild cognitive impairment. Increased sensitivity to susceptibility-enhanced iron imaging, facilitating amyloid and microbleed examination; for example, higher microbleed prevalence was found in AD than previously recognised. Theoretical difficulties regarding image acquisition and scan tolerance were not reported as problematic. Study limitations included small subject groups, a lack of studies investigating LBD and FTD and an absence of longitudinal data. In vivo 7T MRI may illuminate disease processes and reveal new biomarkers and therapeutic targets. Evidence from AD and HD studies suggest that other neurodegenerative dementias would also benefit from imaging at ultrahigh resolution.",28259856,,10.1136/jnnp-2016-315022,17
Recent Findings in Alzheimer Disease and Nutrition Focusing on Epigenetics,"Alzheimer disease (AD) is a chronic neurodegenerative disease with no effective cure so far. The current review focuses on the epigenetic mechanisms of AD and how nutrition can influence the course of this disease through regulation of gene expression, according to the latest scientific findings. The search strategy was the use of scientific databases such as PubMed and Scopus in order to find relative research or review articles published in the years 2012-2015. By showing the latest data of various nutritional compounds, this study aims to stimulate the scientific community to recognize the value of nutrition in this subject. Epigenetics is becoming a very attractive subject for researchers because it can shed light on unknown aspects of complex diseases like AD. DNA methylation, histone modifications, and microRNAs are the principal epigenetic mechanisms involved in AD pathophysiology. Nutrition is an environmental factor that is related to AD through epigenetic pathways. Vitamin B-12, for instance, can alter the one-carbon metabolism and thus interfere in the DNA methylation process. The research results might seem ambiguous about the clinical role of nutrition, but there is strengthening evidence that proper nutrition can not only change epigenetic biomarker levels but also prevent the development of late-onset AD and attenuate cognition deficit. Nutrition might grow to become a preventive and even therapeutic alternative against AD, especially if combined with other antidementia interventions, brain exercise, physical training, etc. Epigenetic biomarkers can be a very helpful tool to help researchers find the exact nutrients needed to create specific remedies, and perhaps the same biomarkers can be used even in patient screening in the future.",27633107,PMC5015036,10.3945/an.116.012229,31
Piperidine Nucleus as a Promising Scaffold for Alzheimer's Disease: Current Landscape and Future Perspective,"Heterocycles and their derivatives hold an important place in medicinal chemistry due to their vast therapeutic and pharmacological significance and wider implications in drug design and development. Piperidine is a nitrogen-containing heterocyclic moiety that exhibits an array of pharmacological properties. This review discusses the potential of piperidine derivatives against the neurodegenerative disease Alzheimer's. The incidences of Alzheimer's disease are increasing nowadays, and constant efforts are being made to develop a medicinal agent for this disease. We have highlighted the advancement in developing piperidine-based anti-neuronal disease compounds and the profound activities of some major piperidine-bearing drug molecules with their important target site. This review focuses on advancements in the field of natural and synthetic occurring piperidines active against Alzheimer's disease, with emphasis on the past 6 years. The discussion also includes the structure-activity relationship, the structures of the most promising molecules, and their biological activities against Alzheimer's disease. The promising activities revealed by these piperidinebased scaffolds undoubtedly place them at the forefront of discovering prospective drug candidates. Thus, it would be of great interest to researchers working on synthesizing neuroprotective drug candidates.",37038678,,10.2174/1568026623666230406084315,3
Prospects and challenges of imaging neuroinflammation beyond TSPO in Alzheimer's disease,"Neuroinflammation, as defined by the activation of microglia and astrocytes, has emerged in the last years as a key element of the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases based on genetic findings and preclinical and human studies. This has raised the need for new methodologies to assess and follow glial activation in patients, prompting the development of PET ligands for molecular imaging of glial cells and novel structural MRI and DTI tools leading to a multimodal approach. The present review describes the recent advancements in microglia and astrocyte biology in the context of health, ageing, and Alzheimer's disease, the most common dementia worldwide. The review further delves in molecular imaging discussing the challenges associated with past and present targets, including conflicting findings, and finally, presenting novel methodologies currently explored to improve our in vivo knowledge of the neuroinflammatory patterns in Alzheimer's disease. With glial cell activation as a potential therapeutic target in neurodegenerative diseases, the translational research between cell biologists, chemists, physicists, radiologists, and neurologists should be strengthened.",31396666,PMC6879435,10.1007/s00259-019-04462-w,26
Identification of hub proteins in cerebrospinal fluid as potential biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease by integrated bioinformatics,"Background:Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a heterogeneous neurodegenerative disease with complex pathophysiology. Therefore, the identification of novel effective fluid biomarkers is essential for Alzheimer's disease diagnosis and drug development. This study aimed to identify potential candidate hub proteins in cerebrospinal fluid for precise Alzheimer's disease diagnosis using bioinformatics methods.Methods:A total of 29 co-significant differentially expressed proteins were identified by differential protein expression analysis in four different cohorts. Functional enrichment analysis revealed that most of these proteins were enriched in pathways related to glycometabolism. Using the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) and random forest feature selection methods, six hub proteins [14-3-3 protein zeta/delta (YWHAZ), SPARC-related modular calcium-binding protein 1 (SMOC1), aldolase A (ALDOA), pyruvate kinase isoenzyme type M2 (PKM), chitinase-3-like protein 1 (CHI3L1), and secreted phosphoprotein 1 (SPP1)] were identified.Results:These six hub proteins were upregulated in the cerebrospinal fluid of patients with Alzheimer's disease compared with cognitively unimpaired control individuals. Meanwhile, SMOC1, ALDOA, and PKM were specifically upregulated in the cerebrospinal fluid of patients with Alzheimer's disease but not in other neurodegenerative diseases. Build AD diagnostic models showed that a single hub protein or six hub proteins combination had an excellent ability to discriminate Alzheimer's disease.Conclusions:In conclusion, our study suggests that these identified hub proteins, which are related to glycometabolism, may be potential biomarkers for further basic and clinical research in Alzheimer's disease.",36396814,,10.1007/s00415-022-11476-2,8
Enlightening the advancements in electrochemical bioanalysis for the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease and other neurodegenerative disorders,"Neurodegenerative disorders (NDD), and particularly Alzheimer's disease (AD), are one of the greatest challenges facing our current medicine and society because of its increasing incidence and the high burden imposed both on patients' families and health systems. Despite this, their accurate diagnosis, mostly conducted by cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis or neuroimaging techniques, costly, time-consuming, and unaffordable for most of the population, remains a complex task. In this situation, electrochemical biosensors are flourishing as promising alternative tools for the simple, fast, and low-cost diagnosis of NDD/AD. This review article provides the relevant clinical details of NDD/AD along with the closely related genetic (genetic mutations, polymorphisms of ApoE and specific miRNAs) and proteomic (amyloid-β peptides, total and phosphorylated tau protein) biomarkers circulating mostly in CSF. In addition, the article systematically enlightens a general view of the electrochemical affinity biosensors (mostly aptasensors and immunosensors) reported in the past two years for the determination of such biomarkers. The different developed strategies, analytical performances and applications are comprehensively discussed. Recent advancements in signal amplification methodologies involving smart designs and the use of nanomaterials and rational surface chemistries, as well as the challenges that must be struggled and the prospects in electrochemical affinity biosensing to bring more accessibility to NDD/AD diagnosis, prognosis, and follow-up, are also pointed out.",32629192,,10.1016/j.jpba.2020.113437,9
"Pineal gland dysfunction in Alzheimer's disease: relationship with the immune-pineal axis, sleep disturbance, and neurogenesis","Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a globally common neurodegenerative disease, which is accompanied by alterations to various lifestyle patterns, such as sleep disturbance. The pineal gland is the primary endocrine organ that secretes hormones, such as melatonin, and controls the circadian rhythms. The decrease in pineal gland volume and pineal calcification leads to the reduction of melatonin production. Melatonin has been reported to have multiple roles in the central nervous system (CNS), including improving neurogenesis and synaptic plasticity, suppressing neuroinflammation, enhancing memory function, and protecting against oxidative stress. Recently, reduced pineal gland volume and pineal calcification, accompanied by cognitive decline and sleep disturbances have been observed in AD patients. Here, I review current significant evidence of the contribution of pineal dysfunction in AD to the progress of AD neuropathology. I suggest new insights to understanding the relationship between AD pathogenesis and pineal gland function.",31296240,PMC6624939,10.1186/s13024-019-0330-8,24
A novel regulator in Alzheimer's disease progression: The astrocyte-derived extracellular vesicles,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is known as an age-related irreversible neurodegenerative disease. AD seriously endangers the health of the elderly, but there is still no effective treatment. In the past several decades, the significant role of astrocytes in the process of AD has been universally acknowledged. In addition, extracellular vesicles (EVs) have been recognized as an essential mediator in intercellular communication and participate in various pathophysiological processes by carrying and transporting diverse cargoes. Moreover, specific conditions and stimuli can modulate the amount and properties of astrocyte-derived EVs (ADEVs) to affect AD progression. Thus, recent studies focused on the involvement of ADEVs in the pathogenesis of AD and the potential application of ADEVs in the diagnosis and treatment of AD, which provides a new direction and possibility for revealing the mystery of AD. Interestingly, it can be concluded that ADEVs have both pathogenic and protective effects in the process of AD through a comprehensive generalization. In this review, we aim to summarize the multi-faces of ADEVs effects on AD development, which can provide a novel strategy to investigate the underlying mechanism in AD. We also summarize the current ADEVs clinically relevant studies to raise the potential use of ADEVs in the discovery of novel biomarkers for diagnosis and therapeutic targets for AD.",36736378,,10.1016/j.arr.2023.101871,2
Non-Naturally Occurring Small Molecule Microtubule-Stabilizing Agents: A Potential Tactic for CNS-Directed Therapies,"Several independent studies indicate that microtubule (MT)-stabilizing agents hold considerable promise as candidate therapeutics for a wide spectrum of conditions of the central nervous system (CNS), from brain tumors to spinal cord injury, as well as a number of neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease, frontotemporal lobar degeneration, Parkinson's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Although the identification and development of candidate compounds for CNS-directed MT-stabilizing therapies has been a challenge in drug discovery for many years, a growing number of molecules have now been identified that exhibit both MT-stabilizing activity and brain penetration. In this Viewpoint, we will highlight the potential utility of MT-active triazolopyrimidines, phenylpyrimidines, and related classes of non-naturally occurring small molecules that exhibit favorable druglike properties, including brain penetration and oral bioavailability. The mode of action of these small molecules has not as yet been fully elucidated at the molecular level. However, based on all available data, compounds from these classes appear to act on MTs in a potentially unique manner. Further characterization of these molecules may have important ramifications for drug discovery, especially in the area of CNS diseases.",28095679,PMC5292930,10.1021/acschemneuro.6b00384,9
An alkaline phosphatase transport mechanism in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease and neurodegeneration,"Systemic inflammation is associated with loss of blood-brain barrier integrity and neuroinflammation that lead to the exacerbation of neurodegenerative diseases. It is also associated specifically with the characteristic amyloid-β and tau pathologies of Alzheimer's disease. We have previously proposed an immunosurveillance mechanism for epithelial barriers involving negative feedback-regulated alkaline phosphatase transcytosis as an acute phase anti-inflammatory response that hangs in the balance between the resolution and the progression of inflammation. We now extend this model to endothelial barriers, particularly the blood-brain barrier, and present a literature-supported mechanistic explanation for Alzheimer's disease pathology with this system at its foundation. In this mechanism, a switch in the role of alkaline phosphatase from its baseline duties to a stopgap anti-inflammatory function results in the loss of alkaline phosphatase from cell membranes into circulation, thereby decreasing blood-brain barrier integrity and functionality. This occurs with impairment of both amyloid-β efflux and tau dephosphorylating activity in the brain as alkaline phosphatase is replenished at the barrier by receptor-mediated transport. We suggest systemic alkaline phosphatase administration as a potential therapy for the resolution of inflammation and the prevention of Alzheimer's disease pathology as well as that of other inflammation-related neurodegenerative diseases.",25500268,,10.1016/j.cbi.2014.12.006,8
Dissecting Alzheimer's Disease Molecular Substrates by Proteomics and Discovery of Novel Post-translational Modifications,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a common complex disease and a major public health burden in both developed and developing countries. Postgenomic technologies such as proteomics and intelligent mining of multi-omics Big Data offer new prospects for diagnostics and therapeutics innovation for AD. In this context, it is noteworthy that mass spectrometry (MS) data are often searched against proteomics databases to unravel the identity of protein biomarkers. In contrast, only a fraction of the MS data can be matched to known proteins, while a large portion of such raw data remains underutilized. Furthermore, the spectral data can be mined for multiple high-confidence post-translational modifications (PTMs) withouta priorienrichment. Thus, AD research stands to gain by greater attention to the biological mechanisms regulated by PTMs. Protein modifications may serve as diagnostic biomarkers or as novel molecular targets for drug discovery. We report here novel PTMs discovered in relation to the AD from MS/MS-based proteomic datasets. Publicly available label-free proteomics data were searched for select PTMs using SEQUEST-HT. Only high-confidence PTMs were analyzed using bioinformatics analysis. We identified 4961 unique modified peptides corresponding to 1856 proteins from AD datasets. Of these, 52 proteins were known to be involved in Alzheimer's pathway. Importantly, 3164 PTMs reported in this study are novel in the context of AD. Furthermore, protein quantification revealed expression of 13 high-abundant secretary proteins across multiple studies, which can be potentially harnessed in the future to develop biomarkers. In summary, this study identifies novel PTMs which might help develop new insights on the molecular substrates of AD and thus inform future development of novel diagnostics and treatments for this highly prevalent disease.",31225774,,10.1089/omi.2019.0085,4
Alzheimer's Disease: Lessons Learned from Amyloidocentric Clinical Trials,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is one of the most debilitating neurodegenerative diseases and is predicted to affect 1 in 85 people by 2050. Despite much effort to discover a therapeutic strategy to prevent progression or to cure AD, to date no effective disease-modifying agent is available that can prevent, halt, or reverse the cognitive and functional decline of patients with AD. Several underlying etiologies to this failure are proposed. First, accumulating evidence from past trials suggests a preventive as opposed to therapeutic paradigm, and the precise temporal and mechanistic relationship of β-amyloid (Aβ) and tau protein should be elucidated to confirm this hypothesis. Second, we are in urgent need of revised diagnostic criteria to support future trials. Third, various technical and methodological improvements are required, based on the lessons learned from previous failed trials.",26187557,,10.1007/s40263-015-0257-8,20
"Japanese, Mediterranean and Argentinean diets and their potential roles in neurodegenerative diseases","Environmental factors are responsible of cellular senescence and processes found in the development of cognitive disorders. The aim of this paper is to compare benefits of the Japanese, Mediterranean, and Argentinian Diet on the onset or prevention of senile dementia (SD) and Alzheimer's Disease (AD). Special focus was on the effects of specific compounds such as polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), antioxidants, and saturated and trans fatty acids. A high adherence to diets rich in PUFAs, monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs) and antioxidants may decrease the risk of developing neurodegenerative diseases; while the predominance of saturated and trans fatty acids possibly rises it.",31000263,,10.1016/j.foodres.2018.10.090,12
Cell-to-cell Communication by Extracellular Vesicles: Focus on Microglia,"Extracellular vesicles, including exosomes and microvesicles, are small, nano-to-micrometer vesicles that are released from cells. While initially observed in immune cells and reticulocytes as vesicles meant to remove archaic proteins, now they have been observed in almost all cell types of multicellular organisms. Growing evidence indicates that extracellular vesicles, containing lipids, proteins and RNAs, represent an efficient way to transfer functional cargoes from one cell to another. In the central nervous system, the extensive cross-talk ongoing between neurons and glia, including microglia, the immune cells of the brain, takes advantage of secreted vesicles, which mediate intercellular communication over long range distance. Recent literature supports a critical role for extracellular vesicles in mediating complex and coordinated communication among neurons, astrocytes and microglia, both in the healthy and in the diseased brain. In this review, we focus on the biogenesis and function of microglia-related extracellular vesicles and focus on their putative role in Alzheimer's disease pathology.",29660443,,10.1016/j.neuroscience.2018.04.003,179
Brain glucose and ketone utilization in brain aging and neurodegenerative diseases,"To meet its high energy demands, the brain mostly utilizes glucose. However, the brain has evolved to exploit additional fuels, such as ketones, especially during prolonged fasting. With aging and neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs), the brain becomes inefficient at utilizing glucose due to changes in glia and neurons that involve glucose transport, glycolytic and Krebs cycle enzyme activities, and insulin signaling. Positron emission tomography and magnetic resonance spectroscopy studies have identified glucose metabolism abnormalities in aging, Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other NDDs in vivo. Despite glucose hypometabolism, brain cells can utilize ketones efficiently, thereby providing a rationale for the development of therapeutic ketogenic interventions in AD and other NDDs. This review compares available ketogenic interventions and discusses the potential of the potent oral Ketone Ester for future therapeutic use in AD and other NDDs characterized by inefficient glucose utilization.",32739015,PMC9989941,10.1016/bs.irn.2020.03.015,21
Astrocytic Pathological Calcium Homeostasis and Impaired Vesicle Trafficking in Neurodegeneration,"Although the central nervous system (CNS) consists of highly heterogeneous populations of neurones and glial cells, clustered into diverse anatomical regions with specific functions, there are some conditions, including alertness, awareness and attention that require simultaneous, coordinated and spatially homogeneous activity within a large area of the brain. During such events, the brain, representing only about two percent of body mass, but consuming one fifth of body glucose at rest, needs additional energy to be produced. How simultaneous energy procurement in a relatively extended area of the brain takes place is poorly understood. This mechanism is likely to be impaired in neurodegeneration, for example in Alzheimer's disease, the hallmark of which is brain hypometabolism. Astrocytes, the main neural cell type producing and storing glycogen, a form of energy in the brain, also hold the key to metabolic and homeostatic support in the central nervous system and are impaired in neurodegeneration, contributing to the slow decline of excitation-energy coupling in the brain. Many mechanisms are affected, including cell-to-cell signalling. An important question is how changes in cellular signalling, a process taking place in a rather short time domain, contribute to the neurodegeneration that develops over decades. In this review we focus initially on the slow dynamics of Alzheimer's disease, and on the activity of locus coeruleus, a brainstem nucleus involved in arousal. Subsequently, we overview much faster processes of vesicle traffic and cytosolic calcium dynamics, both of which shape the signalling landscape of astrocyte-neurone communication in health and neurodegeneration.",28208745,PMC5343893,10.3390/ijms18020358,14
Amyloidogenic Peptides in Human Neuro-Degenerative Diseases and in Microorganisms: A Sorrow Shared Is a Sorrow Halved?,"The term ""amyloid"" refers to proteinaceous deposits of peptides that might be generated from larger precursor proteins e.g., by proteolysis. Common to these peptides is a stable cross-β dominated secondary structure which allows self-assembly, leading to insoluble oligomers and lastly to fibrils. These highly ordered protein aggregates have been, for a long time, mainly associated with human neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (Amyloid-β peptides). However, they also exert physiological functions such as in release of deposited hormones in human beings. In the light of the rediscovery of our microbial commensals as important companions in health and disease, the fact that microbes also possess amyloidogenic peptides is intriguing. Transmission of amyloids by iatrogenic means or by consumption of contaminated meat from diseased animals is a well-known fact. What if also our microbial commensals might drive human amyloidosis or suffer from our aggregated amyloids? Moreover, as the microbial amyloids are evolutionarily older, we might learn from these organisms how to cope with the sword of Damocles forged of endogenous, potentially toxic peptides. This review summarizes knowledge about the interplay between human amyloids involved in neurodegenerative diseases and microbial amyloids.",32093040,PMC7070710,10.3390/molecules25040925,4
Data-driven biomarker analysis using computational omics approaches to assess neurodegenerative disease progression,"The complexity of biological systems suggests that current definitions of molecular dysfunctions are essential distinctions of a complex phenotype. This is well seen in neurodegenerative diseases (ND), such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD), multi-factorial pathologies characterized by high heterogeneity. These challenges make it necessary to understand the effectiveness of candidate biomarkers for early diagnosis, as well as to obtain a comprehensive mapping of how selective treatment alters the progression of the disorder. A large number of computational methods have been developed to explain network-based approaches by integrating individual components for modeling a complex system. In this review, high-throughput omics methodologies are presented for the identification of potent biomarkers associated with AD and PD pathogenesis as well as for monitoring the response of dysfunctional molecular pathways incorporating multilevel clinical information. In addition, principles for efficient data analysis pipelines are being discussed that can help address current limitations during the experimental process by increasing the reproducibility of benchmarking studies.",33757212,,10.3934/mbe.2021094,2
The Role of Oxygen Homeostasis and the HIF-1 Factor in the Development of Neurodegeneration,"Understanding the molecular underpinnings of neurodegeneration processes is a pressing challenge for medicine and neurobiology. Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD) represent the most prevalent forms of neurodegeneration. To date, a substantial body of experimental evidence has strongly implicated hypoxia in the pathogenesis of numerous neurological disorders, including AD, PD, and other age-related neurodegenerative conditions. Hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) is a transcription factor that triggers a cell survival program in conditions of oxygen deprivation. The involvement of HIF-1α in neurodegenerative processes presents a complex and sometimes contradictory picture. This review aims to elucidate the current understanding of the interplay between hypoxia and the development of AD and PD, assess the involvement of HIF-1 in their pathogenesis, and summarize promising therapeutic approaches centered on modulating the activity of the HIF-1 complex.",38731800,PMC11083463,10.3390/ijms25094581,0
Histone H3 Lysine 4 and 27 Trimethylation Landscape of Human Alzheimer's Disease,"Background:Epigenetic remodeling is emerging as a critical process for both the onset and progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common form of neurodegenerative dementia. However, it is not clear to what extent the distribution of histone modifications is involved in AD.Methods:To investigate histone H3 modifications in AD, we compared the genome-wide distributions of H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 in entorhinal cortices from severe sporadic AD patients and from age-matched healthy individuals of both sexes.Results:AD samples were characterized by typical average levels and distributions of the H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 signals. However, AD patients showed a lower H3K4me3 and higher H3K27me3 signal, particularly in males. Interestingly, the genomic sites found differentially trimethylated at the H3K4 between healthy and AD samples involve promoter regions of genes belonging to AD-related pathways such as glutamate receptor signaling.Conclusions:The signatures of H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 identified in AD patients validate the role of epigenetic chromatin remodeling in neurodegenerative disease and shed light on the genomic adaptive mechanisms involved in AD.",35203383,PMC8870338,10.3390/cells11040734,6
Pre-diagnostic cognitive and functional impairment in multiple sporadic neurodegenerative diseases,"Introduction:The pathophysiological processes of neurodegenerative diseases begin years before diagnosis. However, pre-diagnostic changes in cognition and physical function are poorly understood, especially in sporadic neurodegenerative disease.Methods:UK Biobank data were extracted. Cognitive and functional measures in individuals who subsequently developed Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson disease, frontotemporal dementia, progressive supranuclear palsy, dementia with Lewy bodies, or multiple system atrophy were compared against individuals without neurodegenerative diagnoses. The same measures were regressed against time to diagnosis, after adjusting for the effects of age.Results:There was evidence for pre-diagnostic cognitive impairment and decline with time, particularly in AD. Pre-diagnostic functional impairment and decline were observed in multiple diseases.Discussion:The scale and longitudinal follow-up of UK Biobank participants provides evidence for cognitive and functional decline years before symptoms become obvious in multiple neurodegenerative diseases. Identifying pre-diagnostic functional and cognitive changes could improve selection for preventive and early disease-modifying treatment trials.",36223793,,10.1002/alz.12802,10
Improving mouse models for the study of Alzheimer's disease,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex neurodegenerative disease whose risk is influenced by genetic and environmental factors. Although a number of pathological hallmarks have been extensively studied over the last several decades, a complete picture of disease initiation and progression remains unclear. We now understand that numerous cell types and systems are involved in AD pathogenesis, and that this cellular profile may present differently for each individual, making the creation of relevant mouse models challenging. However, with increasingly diverse data made available by genome-wide association studies, we can identify and examine new genes and pathways involved in genetic risk for AD, many of which involve vascular health and inflammation. When developing mouse models, it is critical to assess (1) an aging timeline that represents onset and progression in humans, (2) genetic variants and context, (3) environmental factors present in human populations that result in both neuropathological and functional changes-themes that we address in this chapter.",35461569,,10.1016/bs.ctdb.2021.12.005,0
Role of the Insulin-like Growth Factor System in Neurodegenerative Disease,"The insulin-like growth factor (IGF) system has paracrine and endocrine roles in the central nervous system. There is evidence that IGF signalling pathways have roles in the pathophysiology of neurodegenerative disease. This review focusses on Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease, the two most common neurodegenerative disorders that are increasing in prevalence globally in relation to the aging population and the increasing prevalence of obesity and type 2 diabetes. Rodent models used in the study of the molecular pathways involved in neurodegeneration are described. However, currently, no animal model fully replicates these diseases. Mice with triple mutations inAPP,PSENandMAPTshow promise as models for the testing of novel Alzheimer's therapies. While a causal relationship is not proven, the fact that age, obesity and T2D are risk factors in both strengthens the case for the involvement of the IGF system in these disorders. The IGF system is an attractive target for new approaches to management; however, there are gaps in our understanding that first need to be addressed. These include a focus beyond IGF-I on other members of the IGF system, including IGF-II, IGF-binding proteins and the type 2 IGF receptor.",38674097,PMC11049992,10.3390/ijms25084512,0
Proteogenomics of the human hippocampus: The road ahead,"The hippocampus is one of the most essential components of the human brain and plays an important role in learning and memory. The hippocampus has drawn great attention from scientists and clinicians due to its clinical importance in diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), non-AD dementia, and epilepsy. Understanding the function of the hippocampus and related disease mechanisms requires comprehensive knowledge of the orchestration of the genome, epigenome, transcriptome, proteome, and post-translational modifications (PTMs) of proteins. The past decade has seen remarkable advances in the high-throughput sequencing techniques that are collectively called next generation sequencing (NGS). NGS enables the precise analysis of gene expression profiles in cells and tissues, allowing powerful and more feasible integration of expression data from the gene level to the protein level, even allowing ""-omic"" level assessment of PTMs. In addition, improved bioinformatics algorithms coupled with NGS technology are finally opening a new era for scientists to discover previously unidentified and elusive proteins. In the present review, we will focus mainly on the proteomics of the human hippocampus with an emphasis on the integrated analysis of genomics, epigenomics, transcriptomics, and proteomics. Finally, we will discuss our perspectives on the potential and future of proteomics in the field of hippocampal biology.

"Pathogenesis, therapeutic strategies and biomarker development based on ""omics"" analysis related to microglia in Alzheimer's disease","Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disease and the most common cause of dementia. Among various pathophysiological aspects, microglia are considered to play important roles in the pathogenesis of AD. Genome wide association studies (GWAS) showed that the majority of AD risk genes are highly or exclusively expressed in microglia, underscoring the critical roles of microglia in AD pathogenesis. Recently, omics technologies have greatly advanced our knowledge of microglia biology in AD. Omics approaches, including genomics, epigenomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics/lipidomics, present remarkable opportunities to delineate the underlying mechanisms, discover novel diagnostic biomarkers, monitor disease progression, and shape therapeutic strategies for diseases. In this review, we summarized research based on microglial ""omics"" analysis in AD, especially the recent research advances in the identification of AD-associated microglial subsets. This review reinforces the important role of microglia in AD and advances our understanding of the mechanism of microglia in AD pathogenesis. Moreover, we proposed the value of microglia-based omics in the development of therapeutic strategies and biomarkers for AD.",36058959,PMC9441025,10.1186/s12974-022-02580-1,8
Omega-3 Fatty Acids in Early Prevention of Inflammatory Neurodegenerative Disease: A Focus on Alzheimer's Disease,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the leading cause of dementia and the most common neurodegenerative disease in the elderly. Furthermore, AD has provided the most positive indication to support the fact that inflammation contributes to neurodegenerative disease. The exact etiology of AD is unknown, but environmental and genetic factors are thought to contribute, such as advancing age, family history, presence of chronic diseases such as cardiovascular disease (CVD) and diabetes, and poor diet and lifestyle. It is hypothesised that early prevention or management of inflammation could delay the onset or reduce the symptoms of AD. Normal physiological changes to the brain with ageing include depletion of long chain omega-3 fatty acids and brains of AD patients have lower docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) levels. DHA supplementation can reduce markers of inflammation. This review specifically focusses on the evidence in humans from epidemiological, dietary intervention, and supplementation studies, which supports the role of long chain omega-3 fatty acids in the prevention or delay of cognitive decline in AD in its early stages. Longer term trials with long chain omega-3 supplementation in early stage AD are warranted. We also highlight the importance of overall quality and composition of the diet to protect against AD and dementia.",26301243,PMC4537710,10.1155/2015/172801,63
Intraneuronal protein aggregation as a trigger for inflammation and neurodegeneration in the aging brain,"Age is, by far, the greatest risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD), yet few AD drug candidates have been generated that target pathways specifically associated with the aging process itself. Two ubiquitous features of the aging brain are the intracellular accumulation of aggregated proteins and inflammation. As intraneuronal amyloid protein is detected before markers of inflammation, we argue that old, age-associated, aggregated proteins in neurons can induce inflammation, resulting in multiple forms of brain toxicities. The consequence is the increased risk of old, age-associated, neurodegenerative diseases. As most of these diseases are associated with the accumulation of aggregated proteins, it is possible that any therapeutic that reduces intracellular protein aggregation will benefit all.-Currais, A., Fischer, W., Maher, P., Schubert, D.

Advances in proteomic phenotyping of microglia in neurodegeneration,"Microglia are dynamic resident immune cells of the central nervous system (CNS) that sense, survey, and respond to changes in their environment. In disease states, microglia transform from homeostatic to diverse molecular phenotypic states that play complex and causal roles in neurologic disease pathogenesis, as evidenced by the identification of microglial genes as genetic risk factors for neurodegenerative disease. While advances in transcriptomic profiling of microglia from the CNS of humans and animal models have provided transformative insights, the transcriptome is only modestly reflective of the proteome. Proteomic profiling of microglia is therefore more likely to provide functionally and therapeutically relevant targets. In this review, we discuss molecular insights gained from transcriptomic studies of microglia in the context of Alzheimer's disease as a prototypic neurodegenerative disease, and highlight existing and emerging approaches for proteomic profiling of microglia derived from in vivo model systems and human brain.",37060300,PMC10528430,10.1002/pmic.202200183,1
Natural Products as Modulators of the Proteostasis Machinery: Implications in Neurodegenerative Diseases,"Proteins play crucial and diverse roles within the cell. To exert their biological function they must fold to acquire an appropriate three-dimensional conformation. Once their function is fulfilled, they need to be properly degraded to hamper any possible damage. Protein homeostasis or proteostasis comprises a complex interconnected network that regulates different steps of the protein quality control, from synthesis and folding, to degradation. Due to the primary role of proteins in cellular function, the integrity of this network is critical to assure functionality and health across lifespan. Proteostasis failure has been reported in the context of aging and neurodegeneration, such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease. Therefore, targeting the proteostasis elements emerges as a promising neuroprotective therapeutic approach to prevent or ameliorate the progression of these disorders. A variety of natural products are known to be neuroprotective by protein homeostasis interaction. In this review, we will focus on the current knowledge regarding the use of natural products as modulators of different components of the proteostasis machinery within the framework of age-associated neurodegenerative diseases.",31547084,PMC6801507,10.3390/ijms20194666,8
Intervention modalities for targeting cognitive-motor interference in individuals with neurodegenerative disease: a systematic review,"Individuals with neurodegenerative disease (NDD) commonly have elevated cognitive-motor interference, change in either cognitive or motor performance (or both) when tasks are performed simultaneously, compared to healthy controls. Given that cognitive-motor interference is related to reduced community ambulation and elevated fall risk, it is a target of rehabilitation interventions. Areas covered: This review details the collective findings of previous dual task interventions in individuals with NDD. A total of 21 investigations focusing on 4 different neurodegenerative diseases and one NDD precursor (Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease (AD), dementia other than AD, and mild cognitive impairment) consisting of 721 participants were reviewed. Expert commentary: Preliminary evidence from interventions targeting cognitive-motor interference, both directly and indirectly, show promising results for improving CMI in individuals with neurodegenerative diseases. Methodological limitations, common to pilot investigations preclude firm conclusions. Well-designed randomized control trials targeting cognitive motor interference are warranted.",27548008,,10.1080/14737175.2016.1227704,27
Going beyond the mean: Intraindividual variability of cognitive performance in prodromal and early neurodegenerative disorders,"Objective:Intraindividual variability (IIV), generally defined as short-term variations in behavior, has been proposed as a sign of subtle early impairment in neurodegenerative disorders, presumably associated with the disintegration of neuronal network connectivity. We aim to provide a review of IIV as a sensitive cognitive marker in prodromal neurodegenerative disorders.Method:A narrative review focusing not only on theoretical and methodological definitions, including an overview on the neural correlates of IIV, but mainly on results from population-based and clinical-based studies on the role of IIV as a reliable predictor of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and conversion to dementia in neurodegenerative disorders, mostly Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease.Results:Most studies focus on MCI and Alzheimer's disease and demonstrate that IIV is a reliable cognitive marker. IIV is partly more sensitive than mean performance in the prediction of cognitive impairment or progressive deterioration and is independent of socio-demographic variables and disease mediators (e.g., genetic susceptibility). Neuroimaging data, mostly from healthy subjects, suggest a relationship between IIV and dysfunction of the default mode network, presumably mediated by white matter disintegration in frontal and parietal areas.Conclusions:IIV measures may provide valuable information about diagnosis and progression in prodromal stages of neurodegenerative disorders. Thus, further conceptual and methodological clarifications are needed to justify the inclusion of IIV as a sensible cognitive marker in routine clinical neuropsychological assessment.",30663511,,10.1080/13854046.2018.1533587,22
Emerging Roles of Inhibitor of Differentiation-1 in Alzheimer's Disease: Cell Cycle Reentry and Beyond,"Inhibitor of DNA-binding/differentiation (Id) proteins, a family of helix-loop-helix (HLH) proteins that includes four members of Id1 to Id4 in mammalian cells, are critical for regulating cell growth, differentiation, senescence, cell cycle progression, and increasing angiogenesis and vasculogenesis, as well as accelerating the ability of cell migration. Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common neurodegenerative disease in the adult population, manifests the signs of cognitive decline, behavioral changes, and functional impairment. The underlying mechanisms for AD are not well-clarified yet, but the aggregation of amyloid-beta peptides (Aβs), the major components in the senile plaques observed in AD brains, contributes significantly to the disease progression. Emerging evidence reveals that aberrant cell cycle reentry may play a central role in Aβ-induced neuronal demise. Recently, we have shown that several signaling mediators, including Id1, hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1), cyclin-dependent kinases-5 (CDK5), and sonic hedgehog (Shh), may contribute to Aβ-induced cell cycle reentry in postmitotic neurons; furthermore, Id1 and CDK5/p25 mutually antagonize the expression/activity of each other. Therefore, Id proteins may potentially have clinical applications in AD. In this review article, we introduce the underlying mechanisms for cell cycle dysregulation in AD and present some examples, including our own studies, to show different aspects of Id1 in terms of cell cycle reentry and other signaling that may be crucial to alter the neuronal fates in this devastating neurodegenerative disease. A thorough understanding of the underlying mechanisms may provide a rationale to make an earlier intervention before the occurrence of cell cycle reentry and subsequent apoptosis in the fully differentiated neurons during the progression of AD or other neurodegenerative diseases.",32708313,PMC7409121,10.3390/cells9071746,10
[Progress in lentiviral vector-mediated gene therapy for Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease],"Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD) are common neurodegenerative diseases in human. The pathogenesis of AD and PD is complex, and the current drugs and surgical treatments have not successfully alleviated or terminated the progression of the diseases. The lentiviral vector (LV) is a retroviral vector. In recent years, LV mediated gene therapy has been a hotspot to study the mechanisms of human disease and clinical drug discovery. This review summarizes the recent progresses in the treatment of AD and PD by the application of LV, and offers a prospect for its application.",33398966,,10.13345/j.cjb.200177,0
A Comprehensive Review of Alzheimer's Association with Related Proteins: Pathological Role and Therapeutic Significance,"Alzheimer's is an insidious, progressive, chronic neurodegenerative disease which causes the devastation of neurons. Alzheimer's possesses complex pathologies of heterogeneous nature counting proteins as one major factor along with enzymes and mutated genes. Proteins such as amyloid precursor protein (APP), apolipoprotein E (ApoE), presenilin, mortalin, calbindin-D28K, creactive protein, heat shock proteins (HSPs), and prion protein are some of the chief elements in the foremost hypotheses of AD like amyloid-beta (Aβ) cascade hypothesis, tau hypothesis, cholinergic neuron damage, etc. Disturbed expression of these proteins results in synaptic dysfunction, cognitive impairment, memory loss, and neuronal degradation. On the therapeutic ground, attempts of developing anti-amyloid, anti-inflammatory, anti-tau therapies are on peak, having APP and tau as putative targets. Some proteins, e.g., HSPs, which ameliorate oxidative stress, calpains, which help in regulating synaptic plasticity, and calmodulin-like skin protein (CLSP) with its neuroprotective role are few promising future targets for developing anti-AD therapies. On diagnostic grounds of AD C-reactive protein, pentraxins, collapsin response mediator protein-2, and growth-associated protein-43 represent the future of new possible biomarkers for diagnosing AD. The last few decades were concentrated over identifying and studying protein targets of AD. Here, we reviewed the physiological/pathological roles and therapeutic significance of nearly all the proteins associated with AD that addresses putative as well as probable targets for developing effective anti-AD therapies.",32172687,PMC7536827,10.2174/1570159X18666200203101828,13
Oral Porphyromonas gingivalis Infections Increase the Risk of Alzheimer's Disease: A Review,"Periodontal disease (PD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) are inflammatory diseases affecting the adult population of the world. PD is mainly caused by infection with Porphyromonas gingivalis (P. gingivalis) and by the synergistic action of various microorganisms. These microorganisms penetrate into the subgingival tissue and cause bacteremia, leading to disruption of the homeostasis of the internal environment of the body. Virulence factors known as gingipains, which are cysteine proteases and other toxins, including fimbria and lipopolysaccharides (LPS), are strongly associated with periodontitis and other systemic inflammation. PD has a known polymicrobial aetiology, and patients who eventually develop sporadic AD tend to have recurrent infections before a clinical diagnosis of dementia. AD, the most common neurodegenerative disease, is characterised by poor memory and specific hallmark proteins. An increasing number of studies have shown that periodontal pathogens are increasingly associated with this form of dementia. Many articles have shown that P. gingivalis infections directly increase the risk of PD and may indirectly lead to the development of AD. However, these links and probable pathogenesis remain to be explored. The aim of this review was to explore whether P. gingivalis periodontal infection is associated with AD and to provide possible mechanisms of association.",36651311,,10.3290/j.ohpd.b3818045,2
Falls Associate with Neurodegenerative Changes in ATN Framework of Alzheimer's Disease,"Background:Behavioral markers for Alzheimer's disease (AD) are not included within the widely used amyloid-tau-neurodegeneration framework.Objective:To determine when falls occur among cognitively normal (CN) individuals with and without preclinical AD.Methods:This cross-sectional study recorded falls among CN participants (n = 83) over a 1-year period. Tailored calendar journals recorded falls. Biomarkers including amyloid positron emission tomography (PET) and structural and functional magnetic resonance imaging were acquired within 2 years of fall evaluations. CN participants were dichotomized by amyloid PET (using standard cutoffs). Differences in amyloid accumulation, global resting state functional connectivity (rs-fc) intra-network signature, and hippocampal volume were compared between individuals who did and did not fall using Wilcoxon rank sum tests. Among preclinical AD participants (amyloid-positive), the partial correlation between amyloid accumulation and global rs-fc intra-network signature was compared for those who did and did not fall.Results:Participants who fell had smaller hippocampal volumes (p = 0.04). Among preclinical AD participants, those who fell had a negative correlation between amyloid uptake and global rs-fc intra-network signature (R = -0.75, p = 0.012). A trend level positive correlation was observed between amyloid uptake and global rs-fc intra-network signature (R = 0.70, p = 0.081) for preclinical AD participants who did not fall.Conclusion:Falls in CN older adults correlate with neurodegeneration biomarkers. Participants without falls had lower amyloid deposition and preserved global rs-fc intra-network signature. Falls most strongly correlated with presence of amyloid and loss of brain connectivity and occurred in later stages of preclinical AD.",32741815,PMC7580016,10.3233/JAD-200192,10
Role of Retinal Amyloid-β in Neurodegenerative Diseases: Overlapping Mechanisms and Emerging Clinical Applications,"Amyloid-β (Aβ) accumulations have been identified in the retina for neurodegeneration-associated disorders like Alzheimer's disease (AD), glaucoma, and age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Elevated retinal Aβ levels were associated with progressive retinal neurodegeneration, elevated cerebral Aβ accumulation, and increased disease severity with a decline in cognition and vision. Retinal Aβ accumulation and its pathological effects were demonstrated to occur prior to irreversible neurodegeneration, which highlights its potential in early disease detection and intervention. Using the retina as a model of the brain, recent studies have focused on characterizing retinal Aβ to determine its applicability for population-based screening of AD, which warrants a further understanding of how Aβ manifests between these disorders. While current treatments directly targeting Aβ accumulations have had limited results, continued exploration of Aβ-associated pathological pathways may yield new therapeutic targets for preserving cognition and vision. Here, we provide a review on the role of retinal Aβ manifestations in these distinct neurodegeneration-associated disorders. We also discuss the recent applications of retinal Aβ for AD screening and current clinical trial outcomes for Aβ-associated treatment approaches. Lastly, we explore potential future therapeutic targets based on overlapping mechanisms of pathophysiology in AD, glaucoma, and AMD.",33653000,PMC7956232,10.3390/ijms22052360,21
ER stress activates immunosuppressive network: implications for aging and Alzheimer's disease,"The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) contains stress sensors which recognize the accumulation of unfolded proteins within the lumen of ER, and subsequently these transducers stimulate the unfolded protein response (UPR). The ER sensors include the IRE1, PERK, and ATF6 transducers which activate the UPR in an attempt to restore the quality of protein folding and thus maintain cellular homeostasis. If there is excessive stress, UPR signaling generates alarmins, e.g., chemokines and cytokines, which activate not only tissue-resident immune cells but also recruit myeloid and lymphoid cells into the affected tissues. ER stress is a crucial inducer of inflammation in many pathological conditions. A chronic low-grade inflammation and cellular senescence have been associated with the aging process and many age-related diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease. Currently, it is known that immune cells can exhibit great plasticity, i.e., they are able to display both pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory phenotypes in a context-dependent manner. The microenvironment encountered in chronic inflammatory conditions triggers a compensatory immunosuppression which defends tissues from excessive inflammation. Recent studies have revealed that chronic ER stress augments the suppressive phenotypes of immune cells, e.g., in tumors and other inflammatory disorders. The activation of immunosuppressive network, including myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC) and regulatory T cells (Treg), has been involved in the aging process and Alzheimer's disease. We will examine in detail whether the ER stress-related changes found in aging tissues and Alzheimer's disease are associated with the activation of immunosuppressive network, as has been observed in tumors and many chronic inflammatory diseases.",32279085,PMC7220864,10.1007/s00109-020-01904-z,38
Herbs to curb cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase and their potential role in Alzheimer's disease,"Cyclic nucleotides viz., cAMP/cGMP has been well known to play important role in cellular function and deficiency in their levels has been implicated in the pathogenesis of various neurodegenerative disorders including Alzheimer's disease (AD). Phosphodiesterases (PDE) are the enzymes involved in the metabolism of cyclic nucleotides and the inhibition of phosphodiesterases is considered to be viable strategy to restore the level of cyclic nucleotides and their functions in the brain. Various synthetic PDE inhibitors had been used clinically for various disorders and also suggested to be useful candidates for treating neurological disorders. However, side effects of these synthetic PDE inhibitors have limited their use in clinical practice. Natural plant extracts or their bio-active compounds are considered to be safe and are widely acceptable. During the last decade, many plant extracts or their bio-active compounds were tested pre-clinically for PDE inhibitory activity and are reported to be equally potent in inhibiting PDE's, as that of synthetic compounds. The present review is aimed to discuss the potential plant extract/compounds with PDE inhibitory activity and critically discuss their potential role in Alzheimer's disease.",26050556,,10.1016/j.mad.2015.05.009,12
"Airborne Magnetite- and Iron-Rich Pollution Nanoparticles: Potential Neurotoxicants and Environmental Risk Factors for Neurodegenerative Disease, Including Alzheimer's Disease","Fewer than 5% of Alzheimer's disease (AD) cases are demonstrably directly inherited, indicating that environmental factors may be important in initiating and/or promoting the disease. Excess iron is toxic to cells; iron overload in the AD brain may aggressively accelerate AD. Magnetite nanoparticles, capable of catalyzing formation of reactive oxygen species, occur in AD plaques and tangles; they are thought to form in situ, from pathological iron dysfunction. A recent study has identified in frontal cortex samples the abundant presence of magnetite nanoparticles consistent with high-temperature formation; identifying therefore their external, not internal source. These magnetite particles range from ∼10 to 150 nm in size, and are often associated with other, non-endogenous metals (including platinum, cadmium, cerium). Some display rounded crystal morphologies and fused surface textures, reflecting cooling and crystallization from an initially heated, iron-bearing source material. Precisely-matching magnetite 'nanospheres' occur abundantly in roadside air pollution, arising from vehicle combustion and, especially, frictional brake-wear. Airborne magnetite pollution particles < ∼200 nm in size can access the brain directly via the olfactory and/or trigeminal nerves, bypassing the blood-brain barrier. Given their toxicity, abundance in roadside air, and nanoscale dimensions, traffic-derived magnetite pollution nanoparticles may constitute a chronic and pernicious neurotoxicant, and hence an environmental risk factor for AD, for large population numbers globally. Olfactory nerve damage displays strong association with AD development. Reported links between AD and occupational magnetic fields (e.g., affecting welders, machinists) may instead reflect inhalation exposure to airborne magnetic nanoparticles.",31381513,,10.3233/JAD-190204,11
Associations Between Gut Microbiota and Alzheimer's Disease: Current Evidences and Future Therapeutic and Diagnostic Perspectives,"Developing novel agents for unexplored targets to combat Alzheimer's disease (AD) represents an urgent task due to its increasing prevalence worldwide. The present paper summarizes the latest studies emerged in the past few years investigating the associations between the ""forgotten organ"" gut microbiota and AD from the following two aspects: 1) the associations between gut microbiota and AD development by animal models and human studies; and 2) the effects of gut microbiota modulation-based intervention for AD. Then, we propose future perspectives in two promising research areas: 1) developing gut microbiota modulation-based intervention; and 2) developing gut microbiota-associated diagnostic biomarkers for AD. Knowledge gaps and potential barriers to overcome towards these two goals are also discussed.",30814354,,10.3233/JAD-181143,13
[Drug treatment of Alzheimer's dementia : Status quo and perspectives],"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease of the central nervous system. AD is characterized by progressive impairments of memory as well as other cognitive functions and an increasing loss of autonomy in everyday life.

Mechanisms associated with the dysregulation of mitochondrial function due to lead exposure and possible implications on the development of Alzheimer's disease,"Lead (Pb) is a multimedia contaminant with various pathophysiological consequences, including cognitive decline and neural abnormalities. Recent findings have reported an association of Pb toxicity with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Studies have revealed that mitochondrial dysfunction is a pathological characteristic of AD. According to toxicology reports, Pb promotes mitochondrial oxidative stress by lowering complex III activity in the electron transport chain, boosting reactive oxygen species formation, and reducing the cell's antioxidant defence system. Here, we review recent advances in the role of mitochondria in Pb-induced AD pathology, as well as the mechanisms associated with the mitochondrial dysfunction, such as the depolarisation of the mitochondrial membrane potential, mitochondrial permeability transition pore opening; mitochondrial biogenesis, bioenergetics and mitochondrial dynamics alterations; and mitophagy and apoptosis. We also discuss possible therapeutic options for mitochondrial-targeted neurodegenerative disease (AD).",35048237,,10.1007/s10534-021-00360-7,1
Impact of Neuroinflammation on Hippocampal Neurogenesis: Relevance to Aging and Alzheimer's Disease,"The cognitive reserve is associated with the capacity of the brain to maintain cognitive performance in spite of being challenged by stressful degenerative insults related to aging. Hippocampal neurogenesis is a life-long process of continuous addition of functional new neurons in the memory processing circuits. Accordingly, adult hippocampal neurogenesis is increasingly seen as a key determinant of cognitive reserve robustness. On the other side, neuroinflammation, by releasing a plethora of proinflammatory cytokines and other inflammatory molecules, is increasingly shown to be one of the key determinant pathophysiological factors that negatively impact on neurogenesis and on the cognitive reserve, playing a detrimental role in hippocampal neurogenic niche dynamics and in the progression of neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease. In the present manuscript, we highlight the functional interplay between neuroinflammation, dynamics of the neurogenic niche, and spatial memory performance in healthy and age-related pathological processes, including progression of Alzheimer's disease.",28671124,,10.3233/JAD-170239,35
The contribution of neurodegenerative diseases to the modelling of semantic memory: A new proposal and a review of the literature,"This paper provides a focused review of the literature on semantic impairment in semantic dementia (SD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). An attempt is made to interpret the most relevant phenomena in the light of a new model of semantic memory. This model comprises a language-based component (disrupted in SD and AD), which supports our ability to establish reliable token vs. type relationships in the service of propositional thinking, and a philogenetically older sensorimotor component, which is needed to categorize our environment in a more implicit way. Extant neuropsychological models of semantic memory are also reviewed and compared with the new model in terms of their ability to explain the observed phenomena and to deal with the problem of establishing token vs. type relationships starting from inconsistent cross modal input representations and arbitrary category boundaries.",26102188,,10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2015.06.023,6
"A life-course and multifactorial approach to Alzheimer's disease: Implications for research, clinical assessment and intervention practices","According to the dominant biomedical view, Alzheimer's disease (AD) has a precise, necessary and unifying neurobiological cause, which distinguishes it from other neurodegenerative diseases and normal ageing. However, different types of evidence specifically lead to questioning the foundations of this essentialist and category-based approach to AD. It seems more and more evident that AD represents a heterogeneous state, determined by multiple factors and mechanisms that interact and intervene throughout life. This other way of conceiving AD not only requires a change of research objectives, but also a profound modification of clinical assessment and intervention practices. It also appeals to follow the path of prevention.",27353414,,10.1177/1471301216657270,3
"Dissecting Complex and Multifactorial Nature of Alzheimer's Disease Pathogenesis: a Clinical, Genomic, and Systems Biology Perspective","Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by loss of memory and other cognitive functions. AD can be classified into familial AD (FAD) and sporadic AD (SAD) based on heritability and into early onset AD (EOAD) and late onset AD (LOAD) based on age of onset. LOAD cases are more prevalent with genetically complex architecture. In spite of significant research focused on understanding the etiological mechanisms, search for diagnostic biomarker(s) and disease-modifying therapy is still on. In this article, we aim to comprehensively review AD literature on established etiological mechanisms including role of beta-amyloid and apolipoprotein E (APOE) along with promising newer etiological factors such as epigenetic modifications that have been associated with AD suggesting its multifactorial nature. As genomic studies have recently played a significant role in elucidating AD pathophysiology, a systematic review of findings from genome-wide linkage (GWL), genome-wide association (GWA), genome-wide expression (GWE), and epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS) was conducted. The availability of multi-dimensional genomic data has further coincided with the advent of computational and network biology approaches in recent years. Our review highlights the importance of integrative approaches involving genomics and systems biology perspective in elucidating AD pathophysiology. The promising newer approaches may provide reliable means of early and more specific diagnosis and help identify therapeutic interventions for LOAD.",26351077,,10.1007/s12035-015-9390-0,24
Differential Epigenetic Changes in the Dorsal Hippocampus of Male and Female SAMP8 Mice: A Preliminary Study,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common age-related neurodegenerative disease characterized by memory loss and cognitive impairment. The causes of the disease are not well understood, as it involves a complex interaction between genetic, environmental, and epigenetic factors. SAMP8 mice have been proposed as a model for studying late-onset AD, since they show age-related learning and memory deficits as well as several features of AD pathogenesis. Epigenetic changes have been described in SAMP8 mice, although sex differences have never been evaluated. Here we used western blot and qPCR analyses to investigate whether epigenetic markers are differentially altered in the dorsal hippocampus, a region important for the regulation of learning and memory, of 9-month-old male and female SAMP8 mice. We found that H3Ac was selectively reduced in male SAMP8 mice compared to male SAMR1 control mice, but not in female mice, whereas H3K27me3 was reduced overall in SAMP8 mice. Moreover, the levels of HDAC2 andJmjD3were increased, whereas the levels of HDAC4 andDnmt3awere reduced in SAMP8 mice compared to SAMR1. In addition, levels of HDAC1 were reduced, whereasUtxandJmjd3were selectively increased in females compared to males. Although our results are preliminary, they suggest that epigenetic mechanisms in the dorsal hippocampus are differentially regulated in male and female SAMP8 mice.",37685895,PMC10488283,10.3390/ijms241713084,2
Psychopharmacological Medication Use in Frontotemporal Dementia at the Time of Diagnosis: Comparison with Alzheimer's Disease,"Background:Due to the significant presence of neuropsychiatric symptoms in patients with frontotemporal dementia (FTD) spectrum disorders, psychiatric misdiagnoses, diagnostic delay, and use of psychiatric treatments are common prior to the FTD diagnosis. Furthermore, treatment of diagnosed FTD patients mainly relies on off-label psychopharmacological approaches. Currently, limited real-world data are available regarding the actual use of psychopharmacological medications in FTD.Objective:To evaluate psychopharmacological medication use at the time of FTD diagnosis.Methods:Psychopharmacological medication use was evaluated in a Finnish FTD cohort containing 222 FTD patients, including the major clinical disease phenotypes (behavioral, language, and motor variants) and genetic patients carrying the C9orf72 repeat expansion. A cohort of 214 Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients was used as a neurodegenerative disease reference group.Results:Active use of psychopharmacological medications at the time of diagnosis was significantly more common in FTD compared to AD, especially in the case of antidepressants (26.1% versus 15.0%, OR = 2.01, p = 0.008), antipsychotics (23.9% versus 9.3%, OR = 3.15, p < 0.001), and mood-stabilizers (6.3% versus 1.9%, OR = 2.93, p = 0.085; not statistically significant), whereas the use of cholinesterase inhibitors or memantine was nearly nonexistent in FTD patients. Female gender and behavioral variant of FTD phenotype alongside with depressive and psychotic symptoms were the most prominent factors associating with the use of these medications among the FTD spectrum patients.Conclusion:Use of off-label psychopharmacological medication and polypharmacy is substantially common at the time of FTD diagnosis. This likely reflects the challenges in using symptom-driven treatment approaches, especially prior to the eventual diagnosis.",37574738,,10.3233/JAD-230494,0
Non-steroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs as Candidates for the Prevention or Treatment of Alzheimer's Disease: Do they Still Have a Role?,"Purpose of review:To provide an updated analysis of the possible use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) as treatments for Alzheimer´s disease (AD).Recent findings:Neuroinflammation in AD is an active field of research, with increasing evidence from basic and clinical studies for an involvement of innate or adaptive immune responses in the pathophysiology of AD. Few clinical trials with anti-inflammatory drugs have been performed in the last decade, with negative results.Summary:Besides the information gathered from basic research, epidemiological studies have provided conflicting findings, with most case-control or prevalence studies suggesting an inverse relationship between NSAIDs use and AD, but divided results in prospective population-based incident cohort studies. Clinical trials with different NSAIDs are almost unanimous in reporting an absence of clear benefit in AD.Conclusion:The modulation of inflammatory responses is a promising therapeutic strategy in AD. After three decades of research, it seems that conventional NSAIDs are not the best pharmacological option, both for their lack of clear effects and for an unfavorable side-effect profile in long-term treatment. The development of other anti-inflammatory drugs as candidate treatments in AD may benefit from the knowledge acquired with NSAIDs.",33245273,,10.2174/1567205017666201127163018,8
[Support and guidance in driving for patients with (or suspected of having) Alzheimer's disease or related diseases: position paper],"New ministerial decree restricts driving motorized vehicles for patients with Alzheimer's disease and related disorders. Reisberg stage 3, threshold used to contraindicate driving, appears to correspond to a mild stage of major neurocognitive impairment. A single scale gives an idea of the level of risk but does not provide a holistic assessment. The aim of this consensus is to put forward recommendations from several French learned societies for individualized cognitive assessments to minimize the risks associated with driving and its cessation. Fitness to drive should be raised at the earliest stages of the diagnostic process, and regularly throughout the follow-up. Consult a registered doctor is recommended to all patients wishing to continue driving. All documents must be given to the patient only. An alternative must always be offered to patients who are recommended a modal shift.",38093572,,10.1684/pnv.2023.1124,0
Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder and Alzheimer's disease and any dementia: A multi-generation cohort study in Sweden,"Introduction:We examined the extent to which attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), a neurodevelopmental disorder, is linked with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and any dementia, neurodegenerative diseases, across generations.Methods:A nationwide cohort born between 1980 and 2001 (index persons) were linked to their biological relatives (parents, grandparents, uncles/aunts) using Swedish national registers. We used Cox models to examine the cross-generation associations.Results:Among relatives of 2,132,929 index persons, 3042 parents, 171,732 grandparents, and 1369 uncles/aunts had a diagnosis of AD. Parents of individuals with ADHD had an increased risk of AD (hazard ratio 1.55, 95% confidence interval 1.26-1.89). The associations attenuated but remained elevated in grandparents and uncles/aunts. The association for early-onset AD was stronger than late-onset AD. Similar results were observed for any dementia.Discussion:ADHD is associated with AD and any dementia across generations. The associations attenuated with decreasing genetic relatedness, suggesting shared familial risk between ADHD and AD.",34498801,,10.1002/alz.12462,12
[Beneficial effects of ketogenic diet for Alzheimer's disease management],"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease that affects almost 1 million people in France and 55 million in the world. This pathology is a global health preoccupation because of the lack of efficient curative treatment and the increase of its prevalence. During the last decade, the comprehension of pathophysiological mechanisms involved in AD have been improved. Amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles accumulation are characteristic of Alzheimer's brain patients, accompanied by increased brain inflammation and oxidative stress, impaired cerebral metabolism of glucose and mitochondrial function. Treatment of AD includes different approaches, as pharmacology, psychology support, physiotherapy, and speech therapy. However, these interventions do not have a curative effect, but only compensatory on the disease. Ketogenic diet (KD), a low-carbohydrates and high-fat diet, associated with a medium-chain triglycerides intake (MCTs) might induce benefices for Alzheimer disease patients. Carbohydrate restriction and MCTs promotes the production of ketone bodies from fatty acid degradation. These metabolites replacing glucose, serve the brain as energetic substrates, and induce neuroprotective effects. Such a nutritional support might slow down the disease progression and improve cognitive abilities of patients. This review aims to examine the neuroprotective mechanisms of KD in AD progression and describes the advantages and limitations of KD as a therapeutic strategy.",38018953,,10.1051/jbio/2023031,0
From chronic cerebral hypoperfusion to Alzheimer-like brain pathology and neurodegeneration,"Chronic cerebral hypoperfusion (CCH) is a common consequence of various cerebral vascular disorders and hemodynamic and blood changes. Recent studies have revealed an important role of CCH in neurodegeneration and dementia, including vascular dementia and Alzheimer's disease (AD). This article reviews the recent advances in understanding CCH-induced neurodegeneration and AD-related brain pathology and cognitive impairment. We discuss the causes and assessment of CCH, the possible mechanisms by which CCH promotes Alzheimer-like pathology and neurodegeneration, and animal models of CCH. It appears that CCH promotes neurodegeneration and AD through multiple mechanisms, including induction of oxidative stress, Aβ accumulation and aggravation, tau hyperphosphorylation, synaptic dysfunction, neuronal loss, white matter lesion, and neuroinflammation. Better understanding of the mechanisms of CCH will help develop therapeutic strategies for preventing and treating neurodegeneration, including sporadic AD and vascular dementia, caused by CCH.",25352419,,10.1007/s10571-014-0127-9,64
Lipid and Lipid Raft Alteration in Aging and Neurodegenerative Diseases: A Window for the Development of New Biomarkers,"Lipids in the brain are major components playing structural functions as well as physiological roles in nerve cells, such as neural communication, neurogenesis, synaptic transmission, signal transduction, membrane compartmentalization, and regulation of gene expression. Determination of brain lipid composition may provide not only essential information about normal brain functioning, but also about changes with aging and diseases. Indeed, deregulations of specific lipid classes and lipid homeostasis have been demonstrated in neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD). Furthermore, recent studies have shown that membrane microdomains, named lipid rafts, may change their composition in correlation with neuronal impairment. Lipid rafts are key factors for signaling processes for cellular responses. Lipid alteration in these signaling platforms may correlate with abnormal protein distribution and aggregation, toxic cell signaling, and other neuropathological events related with these diseases. This review highlights the manner lipid changes in lipid rafts may participate in the modulation of neuropathological events related to AD and PD. Understanding and characterizing these changes may contribute to the development of novel and specific diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers in routinely clinical practice.",31382686,PMC6696273,10.3390/ijms20153810,68
Acute versus Chronic Exposures to Inhaled Particulate Matter and Neurocognitive Dysfunction: Pathways to Alzheimer's Disease or a Related Dementia,"An estimated 92% of the world's population live in regions where people are regularly exposed to high levels of anthropogenic air pollution. Historically, research on the effects of air pollution have focused extensively on cardiovascular and pulmonary health. However, emerging evidence from animal and human studies has suggested that chronic exposures to air pollution detrimentally change the functioning of the central nervous system with the result being proteinopathy, neurocognitive impairment, and neurodegenerative disease. Case analyses of aging World Trade Center responders suggests that a single severe exposure may also induce a neuropathologic response. The goal of this report was to explore the neuroscientific support for the hypothesis that inhaled particulate matter might cause an Alzheimer's-like neurodegenerative disease, in order to consider proposed mechanisms and latency periods linking inhaled particulate matter and neurodegeneration, and to propose new directions in this line of research.",33074229,PMC7704925,10.3233/JAD-200679,10
Blood CDKN2A Gene Expression in Aging and Neurodegenerative Diseases,"Background:Cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2A (CDKN2A) is an important gene in cellular senescence and aging.Objective:This study assessed the utility of blood CDKN2A mRNA expression levels and methylation status as a potential biomarker for aging and the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD).Methods:The correlation between CDKN2A mRNA expression levels and age was examined in 45 healthy subjects, after which mRNA expression levels were compared among 46 AD patients, 20 mild cognitive impairment due to AD patients, 21 Parkinson's disease patients, 21 dementia with Lewy bodies patients, and 55 older healthy controls. The methylation rates of the second exon of the CDKN2A gene, known to influence its expression levels, was also examined.Results:A significant correlation between CDKN2A mRNA expression levels and age was found (Spearman's rank correlation coefficient: r = 0.407, p = 0.005). CDKN2A mRNA expression levels in blood were significantly decreased in AD patients, although those of healthy controls were significantly increased with age. Further, only in AD patients were CDKN2A mRNA expression levels significantly and positively correlated with methylation rates.Conclusion:Although further research with a larger sample size is needed to elucidate the relationships between CDKN2A gene expression in blood and the development of other neurodegenerative diseases, CDKN2A mRNA expression in blood may be a biomarker for differentiating AD from normal aging and other neurodegenerative diseases.",34219731,PMC8461666,10.3233/JAD-210483,3
Anti-Neuroinflammatory Potential of Natural Products in the Treatment of Alzheimer's Disease,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an age-related chronic progressive neurodegenerative disease, which is the main cause of dementia in the elderly. Much evidence shows that the onset and late symptoms of AD are caused by multiple factors. Among them, aging is the main factor in the pathogenesis of AD, and the most important risk factor for AD is neuroinflammation. So far, there is no cure for AD, but the relationship between neuroinflammation and AD may provide a new strategy for the treatment of AD. We herein discussed the main etiology hypothesis of AD and the role of neuroinflammation in AD, as well as anti-inflammatory natural products with the potential to prevent and alleviate AD symptoms, including alkaloids, steroids, terpenoids, flavonoids and polyphenols, which are available with great potential for the development of anti-AD drugs.",36771152,PMC9920976,10.3390/molecules28031486,4
Biomarkers of neurodegeneration in schizophrenia: systematic review and meta-analysis,"Question:Does neurodegenerative disease underlie the increased rate of dementia observed in older people with schizophrenia? Several studies have reported a higher prevalence of dementia in people with schizophrenia compared with the general population. This may reflect a higher risk of developing neurodegenerative diseases such as vascular dementia or Alzheimer's disease (AD). Alternatively, this may reflect non-pathological, age-related cognitive decline in a population with low cognitive reserve.Study selection and analysis:We reviewed papers that compared postmortem findings, hippocampal MRI volume or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) markers of AD, between patients with schizophrenia with evidence of cognitive impairment (age ≥45 years) with controls. We subsequently performed a meta-analysis of postmortem studies that compared amyloid-β plaques (APs) or neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) in cognitively impaired patients with schizophrenia to normal controls or an AD group.Findings:No studies found a significant increase of APs or NFTs in cognitively impaired patients with schizophrenia compared with controls. All postmortem studies that compared APs or NFTs in patients with schizophrenia to an AD group found significantly more APs or NFTs in AD. No studies found a significant differences in CSF total tau or phosphorylated tau between patients with schizophrenia and controls. The two studies which compared CSF Aβ42 between patients with schizophrenia and controls found significantly decreased CSF Aβ42 in schizophrenia compared with controls. Hippocampal volume findings were mixed.Conclusions:Studies have not found higher rates of AD-related pathology in cognitively impaired individuals with schizophrenia compared with controls. Higher rates of dementia identified in population studies may reflect a lack of specificity in clinical diagnostic tools used to diagnose dementia.",38796179,PMC11129036,10.1136/bmjment-2024-301017,0
Applying gene-editing technology to elucidate the functional consequence of genetic and epigenetic variation in Alzheimer's disease,"Recent studies have highlighted a potential role of genetic and epigenetic variation in the development of Alzheimer's disease. Application of the CRISPR-Cas genome-editing platform has enabled investigation of the functional impact that Alzheimer's disease-associated gene mutations have on gene expression. Moreover, recent advances in the technology have led to the generation of CRISPR-Cas-based tools that allow for high-throughput interrogation of different risk variants to elucidate the interplay between genomic regulatory features, epigenetic modifications, and chromatin structure. In this review, we examine the various iterations of the CRISPR-Cas system and their potential application for exploring the complex interactions and disruptions in gene regulatory circuits that contribute to Alzheimer's disease.",32654206,PMC8018012,10.1111/bpa.12881,6
Modulation of the neuronal network activity by P2X receptors and their involvement in neurological disorders,"ATP is a key energetic molecule, fundamental to cell function, which also has an important role in the extracellular milieu as a signaling molecule, acting as a chemoattractant for immune cells and as a neuro- and gliotransmitter. The ionotropic P2X receptors are members of an ATP-gated ion channels family. These ionotropic receptors are widely expressed through the body, with 7 subunits described in mammals, which are arranged in a trimeric configuration with a central pore permeable mainly to Ca(2+) and Na(+). All 7 subunits are expressed in different brain areas, being present in neurons and glia. ATP, through these ionotropic receptors, can act as a neuromodulator, facilitating the Ca(2+)-dependent release of neurotransmitters, inducing the cross-inhibition between P2XR and GABA receptors, and exercising by this way a modulation of synaptic plasticity. Growing evidence shows that P2XR play an important role in neuronal disorders and neurodegenerative diseases, like Parkinson's and Alzheimer's disease; this role involves changes on P2XR expression levels, activation of key pathways like GSK3β, APP processing, oxidative stress and inflammatory response. This review is focused on the neuromodulatory function of P2XR on pathophysiological conditions of the brain; the recent evidence could open a window to a new therapeutic target.",26122853,,10.1016/j.phrs.2015.06.009,11
Role of hippocampal subfields in neurodegenerative disease progression analyzed with a multi-scale attention-based network,"Background and objective:Both Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD) are progressive neurodegenerative diseases. Early identification is very important for the prevention and intervention of their progress. Hippocampus plays a crucial role in cognition, in which there are correlations between atrophy of Hippocampal subfields and cognitive impairment in neurodegenerative diseases. Exploring biomarkers in the prediction of early cognitive impairment in AD and PD is significant for understanding the progress of neurodegenerative diseases.Methods:A multi-scale attention-based deep learning method is proposed to perform computer-aided diagnosis for neurodegenerative disease based on Hippocampal subfields. First, the two dimensional (2D) Hippocampal Mapping Image (HMI) is constructed and used as input of three branches of the following network. Second, the multi-scale module and attention module are integrated into the 2D residual network to improve the diversity of the extracted features and capture significance of various voxels for classification. Finally, the role of Hippocampal subfields in the progression of different neurodegenerative diseases is analyzed using the proposed method.Results:Classification experiments between normal control (NC), mild cognitive impairment (MCI), AD, PD with normal cognition (PD-NC) and PD with mild cognitive impairment (PD-MCI) are carried out using the proposed method. Experimental results show that subfields subiculum, presubiculum, CA1, and molecular layer are strongly correlated with cognitive impairment in AD and MCI, subfields GC-DG and fimbria are sensitive in detecting early stage of cognitive impairment in MCI, subfields CA3, CA4, GC-DG, and CA1 show significant atrophy in PD. For exploring the role of Hippocampal subfields in PD cognitive impairment, we find that left parasubiculum, left HATA and left presubiculum could be important biomarkers for predicting conversion from PD-NC to PD-MCI.Conclusion:The proposed multi-scale attention-based network can effectively discover the correlation between subfields and neurodegenerative diseases. Experimental results are consistent with previous clinical studies, which will be useful for further exploring the role of Hippocampal subfields in neurodegenerative disease progression.",36948139,PMC10034639,10.1016/j.nicl.2023.103370,3
Plasma β-Amyloid in Mild Behavioural Impairment - Neuropsychiatric Symptoms on the Alzheimer's Continuum,"Introduction:Simple markers are required to recognize older adults at higher risk for neurodegenerative disease. Mild behavioural impairment (MBI) and plasma β-amyloid (Aβ) have been independently implicated in the development of incident cognitive decline and dementia. Here we studied the associations between MBI and plasma Aβ42/Aβ40.Methods:Participants with normal cognition (n = 86) or mild cognitive impairment (n = 53) were selected from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative. MBI scores were derived from Neuropsychiatric Inventory items. Plasma Aβ42/Aβ40ratios were assayed using mass spectrometry. Linear regressions were fitted to assess the association between MBI total score as well as MBI domain scores with plasma Aβ42/Aβ40.Results:Lower plasma Aβ42/Aβ40was associated with higher MBI total score (p= 0.04) and greater affective dysregulation (p =0.04), but not with impaired drive/motivation (p =0.095) or impulse dyscontrol (p =0.29) MBI domains.Conclusion:In persons with normal cognition or mild cognitive impairment, MBI was associated with low plasma Aβ42/Aβ40. Incorporating MBI into case detection may help capture preclinical and prodromal Alzheimer's disease.",34036829,,10.1177/08919887211016068,30
Periodontitis: A Plausible Modifiable Risk Factor for Neurodegenerative Diseases? A Comprehensive Review,"The aim of this comprehensive review is to summarize recent literature on associations between periodontitis and neurodegenerative diseases, explore the bidirectionality and provide insights into the plausible pathogenesis. For this purpose, systematic reviews and meta-analyses from PubMed, Medline and EMBASE were considered. Out of 33 retrieved papers, 6 articles complying with the inclusion criteria were selected and discussed. Additional relevant papers for bidirectionality and pathogenesis were included. Results show an association between periodontitis and Alzheimer's disease, with odds ratios of 3 to 5. A bidirectional relationship is suspected. For Parkinson's disease (PD), current evidence for an association appears to be weak, although poor oral health and PD seem to be correlated. A huge knowledge gap was identified. The plausible mechanistic link for the association between periodontitis and neurodegenerative diseases is the interplay between periodontal inflammation and neuroinflammation. Three pathways are hypothesized in the literature, i.e., humoral, neuronal and cellular, with a clear role of periodontal pathogens, such asPorphyromonas gingivalis. Age, gender, race, smoking, alcohol intake, nutrition, physical activity, socioeconomic status, stress, medical comorbidities and genetics were identified as common risk factors for periodontitis and neurodegenerative diseases. Future research with main emphasis on the collaboration between neurologists and dentists is encouraged.",38674088,PMC11050498,10.3390/ijms25084504,0
Neurodegenerative disease and cognitive retest learning,"Retest learning impacts estimates of cognitive aging, but its bases are uncertain. Here, we test the hypothesis that dementia-related neurodegeneration impairs retest learning. Older persons without cognitive impairment at enrollment (n = 567) had annual cognitive testing for a mean of 11 years, died, and had a neuropathologic examination to quantify 5 neurodegenerative pathologies. Change point models were used to divide cognitive trajectories into an early retest sensitive component and a later component less sensitive to retest. Performance on a global cognitive measure (baseline mean = 0.227, standard deviation = 0.382) increased an estimated mean of 0.142-unit per year for a mean of 1.5 years and declined an estimated mean of 0.123-unit per year thereafter. No pathologic marker was related to cognitive change before the change point; each was related to cognitive decline after the change point. Results were comparable in analyses that used specific cognitive outcomes, included 220 individuals with mild cognitive impairment at enrollment, or allowed a longer retest learning period. The findings suggest that neurodegeneration does not impact cognitive retest learning.",29558667,PMC6383720,10.1016/j.neurobiolaging.2018.02.016,9
The Role of Visinin-Like Protein-1 in the Pathophysiology of Alzheimer's Disease,"Calcium ions are crucial in the process of information transmission and integration in the central nervous system (CNS). These ions participate not only in intracellular mechanisms but also in intercellular processes. The changes in the concentration of Ca2 + ions modulate synaptic transmission, whereas neuronal activity induces calcium ion waves. Disturbed calcium homeostasis is thought to be one of the main features in the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD), and AD pathogenesis is closely connected to Ca2 + signaling pathways. The effects of changes in neuronal Ca2 + are mediated by neuronal calcium sensor (NCS) proteins. It has been revealed that NCS proteins, with special attention to visinin-like protein 1 (VILIP-1), might have a connection to the etiology of AD. In the CNS, VILIP-1 influences the intracellular neuronal signaling pathways involved in synaptic plasticity, such as cyclic nucleotide cascades and nicotinergic signaling. This particular protein is implicated in calcium-mediated neuronal injury as well. VILIP-1 also participates in the pathological mechanisms of altered Ca2 + homeostasis, leading to neuronal loss. These findings confirm the utility of VILIP-1 as a useful biomarker of neuronal injury. Moreover, VILIP-1 plays a vital role in linking calcium-mediated neurotoxicity and AD-type pathological changes. The disruption of Ca2 + homeostasis caused by AD-type neurodegeneration may result in the damage of VILIP-1-containing neurons in the brain, leading to increased cerebrospinal fluid levels of VILIP-1. Thus, the aim of this overview is to describe the relationships of the NCS protein VILIP-1 with the pathogenetic factors of AD and neurodegenerative processes, as well as its potential clinical usefulness as a biomarker of AD. Moreover, we describe the current and probable therapeutic strategies for AD, targeting calcium-signaling pathways and VILIP-1.",26402751,,10.3233/JAD-150060,26
Mild behavioral impairment: measurement and clinical correlates of a novel marker of preclinical Alzheimer's disease,"Background:Late-life onset neuropsychiatric symptoms are established risk factors for dementia. The mild behavioral impairment (MBI) diagnostic framework was designed to standardize assessment to determine dementia risk better. In this Mini Review, we summarize the emerging clinical and biomarker evidence, which suggests that for some, MBI is a marker of preclinical Alzheimer's disease. MAIN: MBI is generally more common in those with greater cognitive impairment. In community and clinical samples, frequency is around 10-15%. Mounting evidence in cognitively normal samples links MBI symptoms with known AD biomarkers for amyloid, tau, and neurodegeneration, as well as AD risk genes. Clinical studies have found detectable differences in cognition associated with MBI in cognitively unimpaired people.Conclusion:The emerging evidence from biomarker and clinical studies suggests MBI can be an early manifestation of underlying neurodegenerative disease. Future research must now further validate MBI to improve identification of those at the very earliest stages of disease.",34986891,PMC8734161,10.1186/s13195-021-00949-7,23
Impact of genetic predisposition to late-onset neurodegenerative diseases on early life outcomes and brain structure,"Most patients with late-onset neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's have a complex aetiology resulting from numerous genetic risk variants of small effects located across the genome, environmental factors, and the interaction between genes and environment. Over the last decade, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and post-GWAS analyses have shed light on the polygenic architecture of these diseases, enabling polygenic risk scores (PRS) to estimate an individual's relative genetic liability for presenting with the disease. PRS can screen and stratify individuals based on their genetic risk, potentially years or even decades before the onset of clinical symptoms. An emerging body of evidence from various research studies suggests that genetic susceptibility to late-onset neurodegenerative diseases might impact early life outcomes, including cognitive function, brain structure and function, and behaviour. This article summarises recent findings exploring the potential impact of genetic susceptibility to neurodegenerative diseases on early life outcomes. A better understanding of the impact of genetic susceptibility to neurodegenerative diseases early in life could be valuable in disease screening, detection, and prevention and in informing treatment strategies before significant neural damage has occurred. However, ongoing studies have limitations. Overall, our review found several studies focused on APOE haplotypes and Alzheimer's risk, but a limited number of studies leveraging polygenic risk scores or focused on genetic susceptibility to other late-onset conditions.",38605018,PMC11009228,10.1038/s41398-024-02898-9,0
A Comparative Analysis of the Treatment of Decision-Making by or for Patients with Neurodegenerative Diseases in Four Legal Jurisdictions,"Dementia is associated with the gradual impairment of mental ability. The population of people suffering from dementia is as large as 50 million. Most dementia cases result from various neurodegenerative diseases (NDs) linked by a progressive degeneration of neurons. Among NDs, Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most frequent cause of dementia and accounts for 60- 80% of cases. Certain pathological changes on the cellular and subcellular level occur even 15 years before the manifestation of clinical symptoms of AD. This first asymptomatic phase of AD is considered a preclinical stage, whereas mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is the symptomatic pre-dementia stage. The third, fully symptomatic phase of AD is dementia due to AD. The presence of specific proteins in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) may be considered as a characteristic feature of some NDs. The measurement of their CSF concentrations, together with neuropsychological examination and neuroimaging, may be useful for diagnosing AD. The collection of CSF samples is performed by lumbar puncture, which is a medical procedure that requires obtaining informed consent from patients. While asymptomatic AD patients have full legal capacity, those with dementia require a legal guardian who will represent them. Thus, the objective of this study is to compare the legal systems regulating the legal capacity issue in the USA, U.K. (England and Wales), Germany, and Poland. These countries have been chosen as examples of three different types of legal orders, according to the sources of law, i.e., civil law, common law, and case law.",31127787,,10.3233/JAD-190259,6
"Epigenetics in Lewy Body Diseases: Impact on Gene Expression, Utility as a Biomarker, and Possibilities for Therapy","Lewy body disorders (LBD) include Parkinson's disease (PD) and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). They are synucleinopathies with a heterogeneous clinical manifestation. As a cause of neuropathological overlap with other neurodegenerative diseases, the establishment of a correct clinical diagnosis is still challenging, and clinical management may be difficult. The combination of genetic variation and epigenetic changes comprising gene expression-modulating DNA methylation and histone alterations modifies the phenotype, disease course, and susceptibility to disease. In this review, we summarize the results achieved in the deciphering of the LBD epigenome. To provide an appropriate context, first LBD genetics is briefly outlined. Afterwards, a detailed review of epigenetic modifications identified for LBD in human cells, postmortem, and peripheral tissues is provided. We also focus on the difficulty of identifying epigenome-related biomarker candidates and discuss the results obtained so far. Additionally, epigenetic changes as therapeutic targets, as well as different epigenome-based treatments, are revised. The number of studies focusing on PD is relatively limited and practically inexistent for DLB. There is a lack of replication studies, and some results are even contradictory, probably due to differences in sample collection and analytical techniques. In summary, we show the current achievements and directions for future research.",32630630,PMC7369933,10.3390/ijms21134718,9
A Genetic Validation of the Neurodegeneration Biomarkers Tau-A and Tau-C - A Mendelian Randomization Study,"Background:Disease modifying treatments for dementia are only just surfacing, and their development is still significantly hindered by the lack of validated tools for identification of subjects with subclinical disease. Much interest has been taken in developing accessible non-invasive serum biomarkers of neurodegeneration. Recent studies have identified caspase-3-cleaved tau (Tau-C), and ADAM-10 cleaved tau (Tau-A) as possible markers of preclinical neurodegenerative disease.Objectives:To explore if serum levels of Tau-A and Tau-C change as a consequence of neurodegeneration.Design and setting:Cohort study with measurement of biomarkers and genome sequencing at baseline with follow-up after an average of 14 years.Participants:Postmenopausal Danish women from the Prospective Epidemiological Risk Factor (PERF) cohort (n=4968) Methods: Genotyping data was used to perform a Mendelian randomization analysis of serum levels of Tau-A and Tau-C in relation to a diagnosis of dementia at follow-up. A dementia diagnosis was defined as a composite of an all-cause dementia diagnosis derived from the Danish National Health registries, a self-reported diagnosis of dementia and/or cognitive test scores suggestive of dementia. Serum levels of Tau-A and Tau-C were measured blinded in samples from baseline in a CAP certified lab. The association with dementia was assessed using bi-directional one- and two- sample Mendelian randomization.Results:A lead single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) was identified for Tau-A (rs10414043) and Tau-C (rs429358), respectively were identified. Both were located in the APOE/C1 cluster on chromosome 19. APOE and EPOC1 variants were associated with lower levels of Tau-A and Tau-C levels - effect size -0.13, 95%CI [-0.17 - -0.09] log2 (ng/mL), p=7.05e-11 for rs10414043 association with Tau-A and effect size -0.12, 95%CI [-0.15 - -0.08] log2 (ng/mL), p=2e-11 for rs429358 association with Tau-C. When incorporating genetic data from a larger genetic study we found that Alzheimer's disease was marginally associated with a decreased Tau-A and Tau-C levels (Odds Ratio 0.97, 95%CI [0.93 - 1.00]. No association was found in the forward Mendelian randomization analysis.Conclusions:By combining genotype data with serum measurements of the novel biomarkers Tau-A and Tau-C, we conclude that Tau-A and Tau-C levels change because of neurodegeneration. We also conclude that lower serum-values of the biomarkers are associated with the presence of genetic variants commonly found in individuals suffering from late-onset Alzheimer's Dementia. These findings add to the growing data pointing towards Tau-A and Tau-C as valuable biomarkers for neurodegeneration.",37357295,,10.14283/jpad.2023.36,0
To what degree is late life cognitive decline driven by age-related neuropathologies?,"The ageing brain is vulnerable to a wide array of neuropathologies. Prior work estimated that the three most studied of these, Alzheimer's disease, infarcts, and Lewy bodies, account for ∼40% of the variation in late life cognitive decline. However, that estimate did not incorporate many other diseases that are now recognized as potent drivers of cognitive decline [e.g. limbic predominant age-related TDP-43 encephalopathy (LATE-NC), hippocampal sclerosis, other cerebrovascular conditions]. We examined the degree to which person-specific cognitive decline in old age is driven by a wide array of neuropathologies. Deceased participants (n = 1164) from two longitudinal clinical-pathological studies, the Rush Memory and Aging Project and Religious Orders Study, completed up to 24 annual evaluations including 17 cognitive performance tests and underwent brain autopsy. Neuropathological examinations provided 11 pathological indices, including markers of Alzheimer's disease, non- Alzheimer's disease neurodegenerative diseases (i.e. LATE-NC, hippocampal sclerosis, Lewy bodies), and cerebrovascular conditions (i.e. macroscopic infarcts, microinfarcts, cerebral amyloid angiopathy, atherosclerosis, and arteriolosclerosis). Mixed effects models examined the linear relation of pathological indices with global cognitive decline, and random change point models examined the relation of the pathological indices with the onset of terminal decline and rates of preterminal and terminal decline. Cognition declined an average of about 0.10 unit per year (estimate = -0.101, SE = 0.003, P < 0.001) with considerable heterogeneity in rates of decline (variance estimate for the person-specific slope of decline was 0.0094, P < 0.001). When considered separately, 10 of 11 pathological indices were associated with faster decline and accounted for between 2% and 34% of the variation in decline, respectively. When considered simultaneously, the 11 pathological indices together accounted for 43% of the variation in decline; Alzheimer's disease-related indices accounted for 30-36% of the variation, non-Alzheimer's disease neurodegenerative indices 4-10%, and cerebrovascular indices 3-8%. Finally, the 11 pathological indices combined accounted for less than a third of the variation in the onset of terminal decline (28%) and rates of preterminal (32%) and terminal decline (19%). Although age-related neuropathologies account for a large proportion of the variation in late life cognitive decline, considerable variation remains unexplained even after considering a wide array of neuropathologies. These findings highlight the complexity of cognitive ageing and have important implications for the ongoing effort to develop effective therapeutics and identify novel treatment targets.",33742668,PMC8370442,10.1093/brain/awab092,60
A New Kid on the Block? Carbonic Anhydrases as Possible New Targets in Alzheimer's Disease,"The increase in the incidence of neurodegenerative diseases, in particular Alzheimer's Disease (AD), is a consequence of the world's population aging but unfortunately, existing treatments are only effective at delaying some of the symptoms and for a limited time. Despite huge efforts by both academic researchers and pharmaceutical companies, no disease-modifying drugs have been brought to the market in the last decades. Recently, several studies shed light on Carbonic Anhydrases (CAs, EC 4.2.1.1) as possible new targets for AD treatment. In the present review we summarized preclinical and clinical findings regarding the role of CAs and their inhibitors/activators on cognition, aging and neurodegeneration and we discuss future challenges and opportunities in the field.",31554165,PMC6801497,10.3390/ijms20194724,31
Persistent neuropathological effects 14 years following amyloid-β immunization in Alzheimer's disease,"We performed a 15-year post-mortem neuropathological follow-up of patients in the first trial of amyloid-β immunotherapy for Alzheimer's disease. Twenty-two participants of a clinical trial of active amyloid-β42 immunization (AN1792, Elan Pharmaceuticals) or placebo were studied. Comprehensive post-mortem neuropathological assessments were performed from 4 months to 15 years after the trial. We analysed the relationships between the topographical distribution of amyloid-β removal from the cerebral cortex and tau pathology, cerebrovascular territories, plasma anti-AN1792 antibody titres and late cognitive status. Seventeen of 22 (77%) participants had Alzheimer's neuropathological change, whereas 5 of 22 (23%) had alternative causes for dementia (progressive supranuclear palsy = 1, Lewy body disease = 1, vascular brain injury = 1, and frontotemporal lobar degeneration = 2). Nineteen of the 22 participants had received the active agent, three the placebo. Fourteen of 16 (88%) patients with Alzheimer's disease receiving the active agent had evidence of plaque removal (very extensive removal = 5, intermediate = 4, very limited = 5, no removal = 2). Of particular note, two Alzheimer's patients who died 14 years after immunization had only very sparse or no detectable plaques in all regions examined. There was a significant inverse correlation between post-vaccination peripheral blood anti-AN1792 antibody titres and post-mortem plaque scores (ρ = - 0.664, P = 0.005). Cortical foci cleared of plaques contained less tau than did cortex with remaining plaques, but the overall distribution of tangles was extensive (Braak V/VI). In conclusion, patients with Alzheimer's disease actively immunized against amyloid-β can remain virtually plaque-free for 14 years. The extent of plaque removal is related to the immune response. This long duration of efficacy is important in support of active immunization protocols as therapy for, or potentially prevention of, neurodegeneration-associated protein accumulations. Inclusion of patients without Alzheimer's disease in Alzheimer's therapy trials is a problem for assessing the efficacy of treatment. Despite modification of Alzheimer's pathology, most patients had progressed to severe dementia, notably including the five with very extensive plaque removal, possibly due to continued tau propagation. Neuropathology follow-up of patients in therapeutic trials provides valuable information on the causes of dementia and effects of treatment.",31157360,PMC6598630,10.1093/brain/awz142,84
Participation of Amyloid and Tau Protein in Post-Ischemic Neurodegeneration of the Hippocampus of a Nature Identical to Alzheimer's Disease,"Recent evidence suggests that amyloid and tau protein are of vital importance in post-ischemic death of CA1 pyramidal neurons of the hippocampus. In this review, we summarize protein alterations associated with Alzheimer's disease and their gene expression (amyloid protein precursorandtau protein) after cerebral ischemia, as well as their roles in post-ischemic hippocampus neurodegeneration. In recent years, multiple studies aimed to elucidate the post-ischemic processes in the development of hippocampus neurodegeneration. Their findings have revealed the dysregulation of genes foramyloid protein precursor,β-secretase,presenilin 1and2,tau protein,autophagy,mitophagy,andapoptosisidentical in nature to Alzheimer's disease. Herein, we present the latest data showing that amyloid and tau protein associated with Alzheimer's disease and their genes play a key role in post-ischemic neurodegeneration of the hippocampus with subsequent development of dementia. Therefore, understanding the underlying process for the development of post-ischemic CA1 area neurodegeneration in the hippocampus in conjunction with Alzheimer's disease-related proteins and genes will provide the most important therapeutic development goals to date.",33671097,PMC7957532,10.3390/ijms22052460,15
"Impaired 24-h activity patterns are associated with an increased risk of Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and cognitive decline","Background:Sleep-wake regulating circuits are affected during prodromal stages in the pathological progression of both Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD), and this disturbance can be measured passively using wearable devices. Our objective was to determine whether accelerometer-based measures of 24-h activity are associated with subsequent development of AD, PD, and cognitive decline.Methods:This study obtained UK Biobank data from 82,829 individuals with wrist-worn accelerometer data aged 40 to 79 years with a mean (± SD) follow-up of 6.8 (± 0.9) years. Outcomes were accelerometer-derived measures of 24-h activity (derived by cosinor, nonparametric, and functional principal component methods), incident AD and PD diagnosis (obtained through hospitalization or primary care records), and prospective longitudinal cognitive testing.Results:One hundred eighty-seven individuals progressed to AD and 265 to PD. Interdaily stability (a measure of regularity, hazard ratio [HR] per SD increase 1.25, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.05-1.48), diurnal amplitude (HR 0.79, CI 0.65-0.96), mesor (mean activity; HR 0.77, CI 0.59-0.998), and activity during most active 10 h (HR 0.75, CI 0.61-0.94), were associated with risk of AD. Diurnal amplitude (HR 0.28, CI 0.23-0.34), mesor (HR 0.13, CI 0.10-0.16), activity during least active 5 h (HR 0.24, CI 0.08-0.69), and activity during most active 10 h (HR 0.20, CI 0.16-0.25) were associated with risk of PD. Several measures were additionally predictive of longitudinal cognitive test performance.Conclusions:In this community-based longitudinal study, accelerometer-derived metrics were associated with elevated risk of AD, PD, and accelerated cognitive decline. These findings suggest 24-h rhythm integrity, as measured by affordable, non-invasive wearable devices, may serve as a scalable early marker of neurodegenerative disease.",38355598,PMC10865579,10.1186/s13195-024-01411-0,0
"Application of curcumin nanoformulations in Alzheimer's disease: prevention, diagnosis and treatment","Objectives:Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a serious neurodegenerative disease. Although many therapeutic strategies have been studied, their clinical applications are immature. Moreover, these methods can only alleviate symptoms rather than cure it, posing a challenge to brain health in older adults worldwide. Curcumin (CUR) is a very promising natural compound for nerve protection and treatment. It can prevent and treat AD, and on the other hand, its fluorescence properties can be used in the diagnosis of AD. However, CUR is characterized by very low water solubility, fluid instability, rapid metabolism, low bioavailability and difficulty in penetrating the biological barriers, which limit its application. Nanocarriers are a potential material to improve the biocompatibility of CUR and its ability to cross biological barriers. Therefore, delivering CUR by nanocarriers is an effective method to achieve better efficacy.Methods:In this review, the preventive, therapeutic and diagnostic effects of CUR nanoformulations on AD, as well as various patents, clinical trials and experimental research progress in this field are discussed. The aim is to provide detailed reference and practical suggestions for future research.Results:CUR has a variety of pharmacological activities in the prevention and treatment of AD, and its nanoformulation can effectively improve solubility, bioavailability and the ability to penetrate the blood-brain barrier. Significant benefits have been observed in the current study.Discussion:CUR formulations have a good prospect in the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of AD, but the safety and principle of its administration need more detailed study in the future.",35694842,,10.1080/1028415X.2022.2084550,5
Anorexigenic neuropeptides as anti-obesity and neuroprotective agents: exploring the neuroprotective effects of anorexigenic neuropeptides,"Since 1975, the incidence of obesity has increased to epidemic proportions, and the number of patients with obesity has quadrupled. Obesity is a major risk factor for developing other serious diseases, such as type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and cardiovascular diseases. Recent epidemiologic studies have defined obesity as a risk factor for the development of neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other types of dementia. Despite all these serious comorbidities associated with obesity, there is still a lack of effective antiobesity treatment. Promising candidates for the treatment of obesity are anorexigenic neuropeptides, which are peptides produced by neurons in brain areas implicated in food intake regulation, such as the hypothalamus or the brainstem. These peptides efficiently reduce food intake and body weight. Moreover, because of the proven interconnection between obesity and the risk of developing AD, the potential neuroprotective effects of these two agents in animal models of neurodegeneration have been examined. The objective of this review was to explore anorexigenic neuropeptides produced and acting within the brain, emphasizing their potential not only for the treatment of obesity but also for the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders.",38577975,PMC11043025,10.1042/BSR20231385,0
Current emerging novel therapies for Alzheimer's disease and the future prospects of magneto-mechanical force therapy,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disease among the elderly, and the morbidity increases with the aging population aggravation. The clinical symptoms of AD mainly include cognitive impairment and memory loss, which undoubtedly bring a huge burden to families and society. Currently, the drugs in clinical use only improve the symptoms of AD but do not cure or prevent the progression of the disease. Therefore, it is urgent for us to develop novel therapeutic strategies for effective AD treatment. To provide a better theoretical basis for exploring novel therapeutic strategies in future AD treatment, this review introduces the recent AD treatment technologies from three aspects, including nanoparticle (NP) based drug therapy, biological therapy and physical therapy. The nanoparticle-mediated therapeutic approaches at the nanomaterial-neural interface and biological system are described in detail, and in particular the magneto-regulated strategies by magnetic field actuating magnetic nanoparticles are highlighted. Promising application of magneto-mechanical force regulated strategy in future AD treatment is also addressed, which offer possibilities for the remote manipulation in a precise manner. In the future, it may be possible for physicians to realize a remote, precise and effective therapy for AD using magneto-mechanical force regulated technology based on the combination of magnetic nanoparticles and an external magnetic field.",37721092,,10.1039/d3tb01629c,0
Evolving Role of Natural Products from Traditional Medicinal Herbs in the Treatment of Alzheimer's Disease,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prevalent neurodegenerative disease that causes dementia by impairing mental capacity growth and disrupting neurocognitive activity. Despite recent advancements in AD therapy, therapeutic effectiveness has been small, noncurative, and susceptible to drug resistance. The reality that AD's origin remains unknown and that the blood-brain barrier limits treatment effectiveness are two significant impediments to science. Plants are repositories for novel chemical entities, which provide an exciting avenue for Alzheimer's disease studies. Although several herbal remedies are unquestionably efficient, only a small number have been clinically tested for their active chemical constituents and biological activities. Using published data in the literature, we summarized commonly used medicinal plants and herbs and their phyto components for the care and diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease as an alternative therapy. In this, we summarize the main compounds found in 30 different herbal medicines that target neurodegenerative diseases. Using the experimental study of physicochemical properties, we put forward a hypothesis about potential medicinal plants and the management of Alzheimer's disease. The summary analysis demonstrates that conventional herbal medicines produce compounds with physicochemical properties with a high degree of similarities with existing approved medicines.",34010562,,10.1021/acschemneuro.1c00206,11
[Changes in olfaction during ageing and in certain neurodegenerative diseases: up-to-date],"Olfaction is a complex sensory system, and increasing interest is being shown in the link between olfaction and cognition, notably in the elderly. In this literature review, we revisit the specific neurophysiological features of the olfactory system and odorants that lead to a durable olfactory memory and an emotional memory, for which the implicit component produces subconscious olfactory conditioning. Olfaction is known to affect cognitive abilities and mood. We also consider the impairment of olfactory function due to ageing and to neurodegenerative diseases, in particular Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease, through anatomopathological changes in the peripheral and central olfactory structures. The high frequency of these olfactory disorders as well as their early occurrence in Alzheimer disease and Parkinson disease are in favour of their clinical detection in subjects suffering from these two neurodegenerative diseases. Finally, we analyse the impact of olfactory stimulation on cognitive performance and attention. Current observational data from studies in elderly patients with Alzheimer-type dementia are limited to multiple sensory stimulation methods, such as the Snoezelen method, and aromatherapy. These therapies have shown benefits for dementia-related mood and behaviour disorders in the short term, with few side effects. Since olfactory chemosensory stimulation may be beneficial, it may be proposed in patients with dementia, especially Alzheimer-type dementia, as a complementary or even alternative therapy to existing medical strategies.",25304170,,10.1016/j.revmed.2014.09.008,4
Tau-mediated Neurodegeneration and Potential Implications in Diagnosis and Treatment of Alzheimer's Disease,"Objective:To review recent research advances on tau, a major player in Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis, a biomarker for AD onset, and potential target for AD therapy.Data sources:This review was based on a comprehensive search using online literature databases, including PubMed, Web of Science, and Google Scholar.Study selection:Literature search was based on the following keywords: Alzheimer's disease, tau protein, biomarker, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), therapeutics, plasma, imaging, propagation, spreading, seeding, prion, conformational templating, and posttranslational modification. Relevant articles were carefully reviewed, with no exclusions applied to study design and publication type.Results:Amyloid plaques enriched with extracellular amyloid beta (Aβ) and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles comprised of hyperphosphorylated tau proteins are the two main pathological hallmarks of AD. Although the Aβ hypothesis has dominated AD research for many years, clinical Aβ-targeting strategies have consistently failed to effectively treat AD or prevent AD onset. The research focus in AD has recently shifted to the role of tau in AD. In addition to phosphorylation, tau is acetylated and proteolytically cleaved, which also contribute to its physiological and pathological functions. Emerging evidence characterizing pathological tau propagation and spreading provides new avenues for research into the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying AD pathogenesis. Techniques to detect tau at minute levels in CSF and blood have been developed, and improved tracers have facilitated tau imaging in the brain. These advances have potential to accurately determine tau levels at early diagnostic stages in AD. Given that tau is a potential therapeutic target, anti-tau immunotherapy may potentially be a viable treatment strategy in AD intervention.Conclusion:Detecting changes in tau and targeting tau pathology represent a promising lead in the diagnosis and treatment of AD.",29237931,PMC5742926,10.4103/0366-6999.220313,29
"Environment, epigenetics and neurodegeneration: Focus on nutrition in Alzheimer's disease","Many different environmental factors (nutrients, pollutants, chemicals, physical activity, lifestyle, physical and mental stress) can modulate epigenetic markers in the developing and adult organism. Epigenetics, in turn, can cause and is associated with several neurodegenerative and aging-dependent human diseases. Alzheimer's disease certainly represents one of the most relevant neurodegenerative disorders due to its incidence and its huge socio-economic impact. Therefore, it is easy to understand why recent literature focuses on the epigenetic modifications associated with Alzheimer's disease and other neurodegenerative disorders. One of the most intriguing and, at the same time, worrying evidence is that even ""mild"" environmental factors (such as behavioral or physical stress) as well as the under-threshold exposure to pollutants and chemicals, can be effective. Finally, even mild nutrients disequilibria can result in long-lasting and functional alterations of many epigenetic markers, although they don't have an immediate acute effect. Therefore, we will probably have to re-define the current risk threshold for many factors, molecules and stresses. Among the many different environmental factors affecting the epigenome, nutrition represents one of the most investigated fields; the reasons are probably that each person interacts with nutrients and that, in turn, nutrients can modulate at molecular level the epigenetic biochemical pathways. The role that nutrition can exert in modulating epigenetic modifications in Alzheimer's disease will be discussed with particular emphasis on the role of B vitamins and DNA methylation.",25456841,,10.1016/j.exger.2014.10.006,22
Establishment of KEIOi005-A iPSC line from urine-derived cells (UDCs) of a mild Alzheimer's disease (AD) donor with multiple risk SNPs for sporadic Alzheimer's disease (sAD),"Sporadic Alzheimer's disease (sAD) is a neurodegenerative disease that has the highest prevalence among patients with dementia. The genetic risk factors for sAD are comprised of many single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), as indicated by genome-wide association studies. Herein, we generated the KEIOi005-A-induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) line from urine-derived cells (UDCs) of a mild Alzheimer's disease (AD) patient with multiple sAD risk SNPs comprising T > C heterozygous APOE ε3/ε4 (rs429358), A > G heterozygous BIN1 (rs744373), and T > G homozygous MS4A6A (rs610932). The established iPSC line demonstrates normal stemness and pluripotency and can be used for in vitro disease modeling of AD.",35537244,,10.1016/j.scr.2022.102802,4
Perspectives in fluid biomarkers in neurodegeneration from the 2019 biomarkers in neurodegenerative diseases course-a joint PhD student course at University College London and University of Gothenburg,"Until relatively recently, a diagnosis of probable Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other neurodegenerative disorders was principally based on clinical presentation, with post-mortem examination remaining a gold standard for disease confirmation. This is in sharp contrast to other areas of medicine, where fluid biomarkers, such as troponin levels in myocardial infarction, form an integral part of the diagnostic and treatment criteria. There is a pressing need for such quantifiable and easily accessible tools in neurodegenerative diseases.In this paper, based on lectures given at the 2019 Biomarkers in Neurodegenerative Diseases Course, we provide an overview of a range of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and blood biomarkers in neurodegenerative disorders, including the 'core' AD biomarkers amyloid β (Aβ) and tau, as well as other disease-specific and general markers of neuroaxonal injury. We then highlight the main challenges in the field, and how those could be overcome with the aid of new methodological advances, such as assay automation, mass spectrometry and ultrasensitive immunoassays.As we hopefully move towards an era of disease-modifying treatments, reliable biomarkers will be essential to increase diagnostic accuracy, allow for earlier diagnosis, better participant selection and disease activity and treatment effect monitoring.",32111242,PMC7049194,10.1186/s13195-020-00586-6,21
Proteomics for Target Identification in Psychiatric and Neurodegenerative Disorders,"Psychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders such as schizophrenia (SCZ), Parkinson's disease (PD), and Alzheimer's disease (AD) continue to grow around the world with a high impact on health, social, and economic outcomes for the patient and society. Despite efforts, the etiology and pathophysiology of these disorders remain unclear. Omics technologies have contributed to the understanding of the molecular mechanisms that underlie these complex disorders and have suggested novel potential targets for treatment and diagnostics. Here, we have highlighted the unique and common pathways shared between SCZ, PD, and AD and highlight the main proteomic findings over the last 5 years using in vitro models, postmortem brain samples, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) or blood of patients. These studies have identified possible therapeutic targets and disease biomarkers. Further studies including target validation, the use of large sample sizes, and the integration of omics findings with bioinformatics tools are required to provide a better comprehension of pharmacological targets.",33725358,,10.1007/978-3-030-55035-6_17,2
Single-Base Resolution Mapping of 5-Hydroxymethylcytosine Modifications in Hippocampus of Alzheimer's Disease Subjects,"Epigenetic modifications to cytosine have been shown to regulate transcription in cancer, embryonic development, and recently neurodegeneration. While cytosine methylation studies are now common in neurodegenerative research, hydroxymethylation studies are rare, particularly genome-wide mapping studies. As an initial study to analyze 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5-hmC) in the Alzheimer's disease (AD) genome, reduced representation hydroxymethylation profiling (RRHP) was used to analyze more than 2 million sites of possible modification in hippocampal DNA of sporadic AD and normal control subjects. Genes with differentially hydroxymethylated regions were filtered based on previously published microarray data for altered gene expression in hippocampal DNA of AD subjects. Our data show significant pathways for altered levels of 5-hmC in the hippocampus of AD subjects compared to age-matched normal controls involved in signaling, energy metabolism, cell function, gene expression, protein degradation, and cell structure and stabilization. Overall, our data suggest a possible role for the dysregulation of epigenetic modifications to cytosine in late stage AD.",28866733,PMC5909840,10.1007/s12031-017-0969-y,13
The Neuropathological and Clinical Diagnostic Criteria of Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy: A Critical Examination in Relation to Other Neurodegenerative Diseases,"This work critically reviews chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), with a specific focus on the single criterion necessary and sufficient for diagnosis. Herein, CTE is compared to other well-established neurodegenerative entities including Alzheimer's disease and dementia with Lewy bodies. Each neurodegenerative disorder is reviewed in five pertinent areas: 1) historical perspective, 2) guideline formation process, 3) clinical diagnostic criteria, 4) pathological diagnostic criteria, and 5) validation of previously described diagnostic criteria (e.g., sensitivity and specificity). These comparisons indicate that CTE is a disease in the earliest stages of formation and has yet to undergo rigorous development and refinement similar to other neurodegenerative diseases. Suggested future revisions to the diagnostic criterion of CTE include establishing a lower threshold for accumulation of pathology, as well as accounting for the presence of concomitant neuropathology and comorbid neurodegenerative disorders. Currently, while initial efforts have been attempted, agreed upon antemortem clinical criteria do not exist. As has been the scientific standard with similar neurodegenerative disorders, antemortem diagnostic guidelines should first be refined through subcommittees of neuroscientists from diverse institutional backgrounds with a subclassification of levels of diagnostic certainty (possible, probably, and definite). Validation studies should then assess the predictive value and accuracy of proposed antemortem diagnostic criteria in relation to potential pathological criteria.",30856113,,10.3233/JAD-181058,2
Molecular Biomarkers of Neurodegenerative Disorders: A Practical Guide to Their Appropriate Use and Interpretation in Clinical Practice,"Neurodegenerative disorders (NDs) represent a group of different diseases characterized by the progressive degeneration and death of the nervous system's cells. The diagnosis is challenging, especially in the early stages, due to no specific clinical signs and symptoms. In this context, laboratory medicine could support clinicians in detecting and differentiating NDs. Indeed, biomarkers could indicate the pathological mechanisms underpinning NDs. The ideal biofluid for detecting the biomarkers of NDs is cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), which has limitations, hampering its widespread use in clinical practice. However, intensive efforts are underway to introduce high-sensitivity analytical methods to detect ND biomarkers in alternative nonivasive biofluid, such as blood or saliva. This study presents an overview of the ND molecular biomarkers currently used in clinical practice. For some diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease or multiple sclerosis, biomarkers are well established and recommended by guidelines. However, for most NDs, intensive research is ongoing to identify reliable and specific biomarkers, and no consensus has yet been achieved.",38673907,PMC11049959,10.3390/ijms25084323,0
Advances in multiplex PCR for Alzheimer's disease diagnostics targeting CDK genes,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a common neurodegenerative disease that lacks biomarkers for diagnosis. Biomarkers for accurate detection of AD are required for potential therapeutic approaches. Recent studies in mammalian cells have demonstrated an association between the expression of cell cycle proteins and AD occurrence. Therefore, we aimed to identify a potent biomarker among relevant cell cycle-regulating proteins such as cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) for the diagnosis of AD. We also developed a multiplex-PCR-based diagnostic method, which showed the rapid and accurate detection of AD biomarkers. Genome-wide association study (GWAS) results showed increased gene expression of CDKs in an AD mouse model. Based on genomic analysis, our multiplex-PCR method, which contained optimized primer sets and PCR conditions targeting genes of CDKs, accurately matched RT-PCR results in the AD mouse model. Interestingly, validation by in silico meta-analysis for the expression of each CDK gene showed significant expression in moderate and severe groups of AD patients. Accordingly, clinical applications relying on the diagnosis of AD using our results may shed light on AD therapeutics.",33600906,,10.1016/j.neulet.2021.135715,2
Incomplete multi-modal representation learning for Alzheimer's disease diagnosis,"Alzheimers disease (AD) is a complex neurodegenerative disease. Its early diagnosis and treatment have been a major concern of researchers. Currently, the multi-modality data representation learning of this disease is gradually becoming an emerging research field, attracting widespread attention. However, in practice, data from multiple modalities are only partially available, and most of the existing multi-modal learning algorithms can not deal with the incomplete multi-modality data. In this paper, we propose an Auto-Encoder based Multi-View missing data Completion framework (AEMVC) to learn common representations for AD diagnosis. Specifically, we firstly map the original complete view to a latent space using an auto-encoder network framework. Then, the latent representations measuring statistical dependence learned from the complete view are used to complement the kernel matrix of the incomplete view in the kernel space. Meanwhile, the structural information of original data and the inherent association between views are maintained by graph regularization and Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion (HSIC) constraints. Finally, a kernel based multi-view method is applied to the learned kernel matrix for the acquisition of common representations. Experimental results achieved on Alzheimers Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.",33460880,,10.1016/j.media.2020.101953,5
Sulfotransferase 1A3/4 copy number variation is associated with neurodegenerative disease,"The cytosolic aryl sulfotransferase genes SULT1A3 and SULT1A4 are located on chromosome 16p11.2 in a region of chromosomal instability. SULT1A3/4 are important enzymes in the metabolism of catecholamines linked to neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's and Alzheimer's. In the present study, copy number variation of the SULT1A3/4 genes in healthy individuals, as well as a cohort of Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease patients was examined. In all subjects, SULT1A3/4 copy number varied from 1 to 10. In Alzheimer's disease patients, there was a significantly lower copy number compared to controls, and a positive correlation between copy number and age of disease onset. By contrast, there were no differences in Parkinson's disease patients. However, when early-onset Parkinson's disease was evaluated separately, there appeared to be an association with gene copy number and risk. The current study shows that these neurodegenerative diseases may be related to SULT1A3/4 copy number.",28374858,,10.1038/tpj.2017.4,10

Salivaomics as a Potential Tool for Predicting Alzheimer's Disease During the Early Stages of Neurodegeneration,"Background:The metabolomic and proteomic basis of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) is poorly understood and the relationships between systemic abnormalities in metabolism and AD/AMCI pathogenesis are unclear.Objective:The aim of the study was to compare the metabolomic and proteomic signature of saliva from cognitively normal and patients diagnosed with MCI or AD, to identify specific cellular pathways altered with the progression of the disease.Methods:We analyzed 80 saliva samples from individuals with MCI or AD as well as age- and gender-matched healthy controls. Saliva proteomic and metabolomic analyses were conducted utilizing mass spectrometry methods and data combined using pathway analysis.Results:We found significant alterations in multiple cellular pathways, demonstrating that at the omics level, disease progression impacts numerous cellular processes. Multivariate statistics using SIMCA showed that partial least squares-data analysis could be used to provide separation of the three groups.Conclusion:This study found significant changes in metabolites and proteins from multiple cellular pathways in saliva. These changes were associated with AD, demonstrating that this approach might prove useful to identify new biomarkers based upon integration of multi-omics parameters.",34151801,PMC8461673,10.3233/JAD-210283,9
"The Use of Neuroimaging to Assess Associations Among Diet, Nutrients, Metabolic Syndrome, and Alzheimer's Disease","In the last decade, specific dietary patterns, mainly characterized by high consumption of vegetables and fruits, have been proven beneficial for the prevention of both metabolic syndrome (MetS)-related dysfunctions and neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). Nowadays, neuroimaging readouts can be used to diagnose AD, investigate MetS effects on brain functionality and anatomy, and assess the effects of dietary supplementations and nutritional patterns in relation to neurodegeneration and AD-related features. Here we review scientific literature describing the use of the most recent neuroimaging techniques to detect AD- and MetS-related brain features, and also to investigate associations between consolidated dietary patterns or nutritional interventions and AD, specifically focusing on observational and intervention studies in humans.",26401997,,10.3233/JAD-150301,3
Evaluation of Swallowing Function according to the Stage of Alzheimer's Disease,"Background:Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease, and swallowing difficulties may occur as the disease progresses. Dysphagia has many consequences, such as aspiration and pneumonia. In particular, in the advanced stage, approximately 70% of the causes of death in AD involve aspiration pneumonia. Therefore, it is vital to assess the presence or absence of dysphagia in AD.Objective:This study aims to describe swallowing difficulty across the stages of AD.Methods:Thirty-five AD patients were evaluated. The Mini-Mental State Examination was conducted. A bedside water swallow test (BWST) and the Eating Assessment Tool (EAT-10) were administered. Finally, fiberoptic endoscopic evaluation of swallowing was used to evaluate residual, aspiration and penetration conditions.Results:EAT-10 scores, BWST results, and penetration-aspiration status were statistically significantly different according to AD stage (p < 0.05). Among all patients, 74.3% had residue, 25.7% had penetration, and 2.9% had aspiration.Conclusions:This study has demonstrated that swallowing dysfunction begins at a mild stage and progressively worsens toward the advanced stage in patients with AD. At all stages of AD, residue was observed, and this poses a risk for the development of penetration-aspiration. Therefore, it is necessary to evaluate the early dysphagia of individuals.",34469898,,10.1159/000519263,4
Endosomal Dysfunction Induced by Directly Overactivating Rab5 Recapitulates Prodromal and Neurodegenerative Features of Alzheimer's Disease,"Neuronal endosomal dysfunction, the earliest known pathobiology specific to Alzheimer's disease (AD), is mediated by the aberrant activation of Rab5 triggered by APP-β secretase cleaved C-terminal fragment (APP-βCTF). To distinguish pathophysiological consequences specific to overactivated Rab5 itself, we activate Rab5 independently from APP-βCTF in the PA-Rab5 mouse model. We report that Rab5 overactivation alone recapitulates diverse prodromal and degenerative features of AD. Modest neuron-specific transgenic Rab5 expression inducing hyperactivation of Rab5 comparable to that in AD brain reproduces AD-related Rab5-endosomal enlargement and mistrafficking, hippocampal synaptic plasticity deficits via accelerated AMPAR endocytosis and dendritic spine loss, and tau hyperphosphorylation via activated glycogen synthase kinase-3β. Importantly, Rab5-mediated endosomal dysfunction induces progressive cholinergic neurodegeneration and impairs hippocampal-dependent memory. Aberrant neuronal Rab5-endosome signaling, therefore, drives a pathogenic cascade distinct from β-amyloid-related neurotoxicity, which includes prodromal and neurodegenerative features of AD, and suggests Rab5 overactivation as a potential therapeutic target.",33238112,PMC7714675,10.1016/j.celrep.2020.108420,40
The role of Alu-derived RNAs in Alzheimer's and other neurodegenerative conditions,"Non-coding RNAs have emerged as essential contributors to neuroinflammation. The Alu element is the most abundant potential source of non-coding RNA in the human genome represented by over 1.1 million copies totaling ∼10% of the genome's mass. Accumulation of ""Alu RNA"" was observed in the brains of individuals with dementia and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease - a degenerative brain disorder. ""Alu RNAs"" activate inflammatory pathways and apoptosis in the non-neural cells. In particular, the ""Alu RNA"" cytotoxicity is suggested as a mechanism in retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), a compartment damaged in the process of age-related macular degeneration. In RPE cells, the deficiency of Dicer is reported to lead to an accumulation of P3Alu transcripts, subsequent activation of the ERK1/2 signaling pathway, and the formation of NLRP3 inflammasome. In turn, these events result in RPE cell death by apoptosis. Importantly, RPE cells are of neuroectodermal origin, these cells display more similarity to neurons than to other epithelial cells. Thus, it is plausible that the mechanisms of ""Alu RNA"" cytotoxicity in brain neurons are similar to that in RPE. We hypothesize that accumulation of polymerase III-transcribed noncoding RNA of Alu (P3Alu) may contribute to both neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other degenerative brain disorders. This hypothesis points toward a novel molecular pathway not previously considered for the treatment of AD.",29685192,,10.1016/j.mehy.2018.03.008,10
Comprehensive Review on Alzheimer's Disease: Causes and Treatment,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a disorder that causes degeneration of the cells in the brain and it is the main cause of dementia, which is characterized by a decline in thinking and independence in personal daily activities. AD is considered a multifactorial disease: two main hypotheses were proposed as a cause for AD, cholinergic and amyloid hypotheses. Additionally, several risk factors such as increasing age, genetic factors, head injuries, vascular diseases, infections, and environmental factors play a role in the disease. Currently, there are only two classes of approved drugs to treat AD, including inhibitors to cholinesterase enzyme and antagonists toN-methyl d-aspartate (NMDA), which are effective only in treating the symptoms of AD, but do not cure or prevent the disease. Nowadays, the research is focusing on understanding AD pathology by targeting several mechanisms, such as abnormal tau protein metabolism, β-amyloid, inflammatory response, and cholinergic and free radical damage, aiming to develop successful treatments that are capable of stopping or modifying the course of AD. This review discusses currently available drugs and future theories for the development of new therapies for AD, such as disease-modifying therapeutics (DMT), chaperones, and natural compounds.",33302541,PMC7764106,10.3390/molecules25245789,523
Alzheimer's Disease: Treatment Strategies and Their Limitations,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most frequent case of neurodegenerative disease and is becoming a major public health problem all over the world. Many therapeutic strategies have been explored for several decades; however, there is still no curative treatment, and the priority remains prevention. In this review, we present an update on the clinical and physiological phase of the AD spectrum, modifiable and non-modifiable risk factors for AD treatment with a focus on prevention strategies, then research models used in AD, followed by a discussion of treatment limitations. The prevention methods can significantly slow AD evolution and are currently the best strategy possible before the advanced stages of the disease. Indeed, current drug treatments have only symptomatic effects, and disease-modifying treatments are not yet available. Drug delivery to the central nervous system remains a complex process and represents a challenge for developing therapeutic and preventive strategies. Studies are underway to test new techniques to facilitate the bioavailability of molecules to the brain. After a deep study of the literature, we find the use of soft nanoparticles, in particular nanoliposomes and exosomes, as an innovative approach for preventive and therapeutic strategies in reducing the risk of AD and solving problems of brain bioavailability. Studies show the promising role of nanoliposomes and exosomes as smart drug delivery systems able to penetrate the blood-brain barrier and target brain tissues. Finally, the different drug administration techniques for neurological disorders are discussed. One of the promising therapeutic methods is the intranasal administration strategy which should be used for preclinical and clinical studies of neurodegenerative diseases.",36430432,PMC9697769,10.3390/ijms232213954,41
The role of nutrition in Alzheimer's disease,"The aging population is a significant social, medical and economic problem due to increasing prevalence of chronic diseases in elderly population. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia and the most common neurodegenerative disease. It is characterized by a progressive deterioration of memory and cognitive function. So far, there is neither an effective prevention nor cure for dementia, so more and more attention is paid to the prevention of this group of diseases, particularly to the appropriate diet. Preventive intervention gives the best results if introduced before the first symptoms of dementia, i.e., around the age of 50. This is when the nutritional status, number of synapses, cognition, and neuropathological changes in the nervous system compensate each other, which increases the chances of staying healthy for a longer period of time. It has been proven that dietary habits, which lead to the development of cardiovascular and metabolic diseases, significantly increase the risk of dementia. On the other hand, a Mediterranean diet rich in antioxidants, fiber and omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids may have a protective effect on the neurodegenerative process. The beneficial effect of many nutrients on the course of AD has been demonstrated. These include: glutathione, polyphenols, curcumin, coenzyme Q10, vitamins B6, B12, folic acid, unsaturated fatty acids, lecithin, UA, caffeine and some probiotic bacteria. A diet rich in saturated fatty acids and branched-chain amino acids (BCAA) promotes the progression of dementia. Dietary intervention should be introduced as early as possible to minimize the risk of developing dementia. The Mediterranean and DASH diets have been documented to protect against AD. However, the MIND diet is reported to be much more effective in preventing cognitive decline/dementia than either the Mediterranean or DASH diets alone.",33882663,,10.32394/rpzh.2021.0154,12
Retinal imaging in Alzheimer's and neurodegenerative diseases,"In the last 20 years, research focused on developing retinal imaging as a source of potential biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease and other neurodegenerative diseases, has increased significantly. The Alzheimer's Association and the Alzheimer's & Dementia: Diagnosis, Assessment, Disease Monitoring editorial team (companion journal to Alzheimer's & Dementia) convened an interdisciplinary discussion in 2019 to identify a path to expedite the development of retinal biomarkers capable of identifying biological changes associated with AD, and for tracking progression of disease severity over time. As different retinal imaging modalities provide different types of structural and/or functional information, the discussion reflected on these modalities and their respective strengths and weaknesses. Discussion further focused on the importance of defining the context of use to help guide the development of retinal biomarkers. Moving from research to context of use, and ultimately to clinical evaluation, this article outlines ongoing retinal imaging research today in Alzheimer's and other brain diseases, including a discussion of future directions for this area of study.",33090722,PMC8062064,10.1002/alz.12179,59
A Unique Microglia Type Associated with Restricting Development of Alzheimer's Disease,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a detrimental neurodegenerative disease with no effective treatments. Due to cellular heterogeneity, defining the roles of immune cell subsets in AD onset and progression has been challenging. Using transcriptional single-cell sorting, we comprehensively map all immune populations in wild-type and AD-transgenic (Tg-AD) mouse brains. We describe a novel microglia type associated with neurodegenerative diseases (DAM) and identify markers, spatial localization, and pathways associated with these cells. Immunohistochemical staining of mice and human brain slices shows DAM with intracellular/phagocytic Aβ particles. Single-cell analysis of DAM in Tg-AD and triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (Trem2)-/-Tg-AD reveals that the DAM program is activated in a two-step process. Activation is initiated in a Trem2-independent manner that involves downregulation of microglia checkpoints, followed by activation of a Trem2-dependent program. This unique microglia-type has the potential to restrict neurodegeneration, which may have important implications for future treatment of AD and other neurodegenerative diseases.

Biomarkers for neurodegenerative diseases,"Biomarkers for neurodegenerative diseases are needed to improve the diagnostic workup in the clinic but also to facilitate the development and monitoring of effective disease-modifying therapies. Positron emission tomography methods detecting amyloid-β and tau pathology in Alzheimer's disease have been increasingly used to improve the design of clinical trials and observational studies. In recent years, easily accessible and cost-effective blood-based biomarkers detecting the same Alzheimer's disease pathologies have been developed, which might revolutionize the diagnostic workup of Alzheimer's disease globally. Relevant biomarkers for α-synuclein pathology in Parkinson's disease are also emerging, as well as blood-based markers of general neurodegeneration and glial activation. This review presents an overview of the latest advances in the field of biomarkers for neurodegenerative diseases. Future directions are discussed regarding implementation of novel biomarkers in clinical practice and trials.",34083813,,10.1038/s41591-021-01382-x,251
Epigenetics of Alzheimer's Disease,"There are currently no validated biomarkers which can be used to accurately diagnose Alzheimer's disease (AD) or to distinguish it from other dementia-causing neuropathologies. Moreover, to date, only symptomatic treatments exist for this progressive neurodegenerative disorder. In the search for new, more reliable biomarkers and potential therapeutic options, epigenetic modifications have emerged as important players in the pathogenesis of AD. The aim of the article was to provide a brief overview of the current knowledge regarding the role of epigenetics (including mitoepigenetics) in AD, and the possibility of applying these advances for future AD therapy. Extensive research has suggested an important role of DNA methylation and hydroxymethylation, histone posttranslational modifications, and non-coding RNA regulation (with the emphasis on microRNAs) in the course and development of AD. Recent studies also indicated mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) as an interesting biomarker of AD, since dysfunctions in the mitochondria and lower mtDNA copy number have been associated with AD pathophysiology. The current evidence suggests that epigenetic changes can be successfully detected, not only in the central nervous system, but also in the cerebrospinal fluid and on the periphery, contributing further to their potential as both biomarkers and therapeutic targets in AD.",33573255,PMC7911414,10.3390/biom11020195,54
Clinical Neurology and Epidemiology of the Major Neurodegenerative Diseases,"Neurodegenerative diseases are a common cause of morbidity and cognitive impairment in older adults. Most clinicians who care for the elderly are not trained to diagnose these conditions, perhaps other than typical Alzheimer's disease (AD). Each of these disorders has varied epidemiology, clinical symptomatology, laboratory and neuroimaging features, neuropathology, and management. Thus, it is important that clinicians be able to differentiate and diagnose these conditions accurately. This review summarizes and highlights clinical aspects of several of the most commonly encountered neurodegenerative diseases, including AD, frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and its variants, progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), corticobasal degeneration (CBD), Parkinson's disease (PD), dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), multiple system atrophy (MSA), and Huntington's disease (HD). For each condition, we provide a brief overview of the epidemiology, defining clinical symptoms and diagnostic criteria, relevant imaging and laboratory features, genetics, pathology, treatments, and differential diagnosis.",28716886,PMC5880171,10.1101/cshperspect.a033118,356
The neuropathological diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease,"Alzheimer's disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disease most often associated with memory deficits and cognitive decline, although less common clinical presentations are increasingly recognized. The cardinal pathological features of the disease have been known for more than one hundred years, and today the presence of these amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles are still required for a pathological diagnosis. Alzheimer's disease is the most common cause of dementia globally. There remain no effective treatment options for the great majority of patients, and the primary causes of the disease are unknown except in a small number of familial cases driven by genetic mutations. Confounding efforts to develop effective diagnostic tools and disease-modifying therapies is the realization that Alzheimer's disease is a mixed proteinopathy (amyloid and tau) frequently associated with other age-related processes such as cerebrovascular disease and Lewy body disease. Defining the relationships between and interdependence of various co-pathologies remains an active area of investigation. This review outlines etiologically-linked pathologic features of Alzheimer's disease, as well as those that are inevitable findings of uncertain significance, such as granulovacuolar degeneration and Hirano bodies. Other disease processes that are frequent, but not inevitable, are also discussed, including pathologic processes that can clinically mimic Alzheimer's disease. These include cerebrovascular disease, Lewy body disease, TDP-43 proteinopathies and argyrophilic grain disease. The purpose of this review is to provide an overview of Alzheimer's disease pathology, its defining pathologic substrates and the related pathologies that can affect diagnosis and treatment.",31375134,PMC6679484,10.1186/s13024-019-0333-5,927
Neuroinflammation in Alzheimer's disease: Current evidence and future directions,"Several attempts have been made to treat Alzheimer's disease (AD) using anti-amyloid strategies with disappointing results. It is clear that the ""amyloid cascade hypothesis"" alone cannot fully explain the neuronal damage in AD, as evidenced both by autopsy and imaging studies. Neuroinflammation plays a significant role in neurodegenerative diseases, whereas the debate is ongoing about its precise role, whether it is protective or harmful. In this review, we focus on the potential mechanism of glial activation and how local and systemic factors influence disease progression. We focus on neuroinflammation in AD, especially in the earliest stages, a vicious cycle of glial priming, release of pro-inflammatory factors, and neuronal damage. We review the evidence from imaging studies, regarding the temporal relationship between amyloid deposition and neuroinflammation, the influence of systemic inflammation on glial activation, both in acute and chronic stimulation and the relevance of inflammation as a diagnostic and therapeutic target.",27179961,,10.1016/j.jalz.2016.02.010,614
Tau liquid-liquid phase separation in neurodegenerative diseases,"Aggregation of the microtubule-associated protein tau plays a major role in Alzheimer's disease and several other neurodegenerative disorders. An exciting recent development is the finding that, akin to some other proteins associated with neurodegenerative disease, tau has a high propensity to condensate via the mechanism of liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS). Here, we discuss the evidence for tau LLPS in vitro, the molecular mechanisms of this reaction, and the role of post-translational modifications and pathogenic mutations in tau phase separation. We also discuss recent studies on tau LLPS in cells and the insights these studies provide regarding the link between LLPS and neurodegeneration in tauopathies.",35181198,PMC9189016,10.1016/j.tcb.2022.01.011,27
Ketogenic Diet: An Effective Treatment Approach for Neurodegenerative Diseases,"This review discusses the effects and mechanisms of a ketogenic diet on neurodegenerative diseases on the basis of available evidence. A ketogenic diet refers to a high-fat, mediumprotein, and low-carbohydrate diet that leads to a metabolic shift to ketosis. This review systematically summarizes the scientific literature supporting this effective treatment approach for neurodegenerative diseases, including effects on mitochondrial function, oxidative stress, neuronal apoptosis, neuroinflammation, and the microbiota-gut-brain axis. It also highlights the clinical evidence for the effects of the ketogenic diet in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and motor neuron disease. Finally, it discusses the common adverse effects of ketogenic therapy. Although the complete mechanism of the ketogenic diet in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases remains to be elucidated, its clinical efficacy has attracted many new followers. The ketogenic diet is a good candidate for adjuvant therapy, but its specific applicability depends on the type and the degree of the disease.",36043794,PMC9890290,10.2174/1570159X20666220830102628,9
Mitochondrial abnormalities in Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease: can mitochondria be targeted therapeutically?,"Mitochondrial abnormalities have been identified as a central mechanism in multiple neurodegenerative diseases and, therefore, the mitochondria have been explored as a therapeutic target. This review will focus on the evidence for mitochondrial abnormalities in the two most common neurodegenerative diseases, Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease. In addition, we discuss the main strategies which have been explored in these diseases to target the mitochondria for therapeutic purposes, focusing on mitochondrially targeted antioxidants, peptides, modulators of mitochondrial dynamics and phenotypic screening outcomes.",30026371,,10.1042/BST20170501,82
Alzheimer's Disease Including Focal Presentations,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the commonest neurodegenerative disease and the most frequent cause of dementia. It affects 30 million people worldwide. Current research criteria focus on biomarkers' status for amyloid and tau using positron emission tomography and cerebrospinal fluid analysis, independent of clinical status. Current epidemiological data, which mostly rely on biomarker-undetermined AD cases, have highlighted ApoE4 and age as the main risk factors. Rare autosomal dominant mutations also account for a small fraction of early-onset AD. The main clinical phenotype at presentation is the amnestic phenotype targeting episodic memory. This is followed by rarer phenotypes such as posterior cortical atrophy, logopenic variant of primary progressive aphasia, frontal variant AD, corticobasal syndrome, and other even rarer presentations mimicking language variants of frontotemporal dementia. Main differential diagnoses include hippocampal sclerosis with TDP-43, primary age-related tauopathy, argyrophilic grain disease, frontotemporal lobar degeneration, Lewy body disease, chronic traumatic encephalopathy as well as nondegenerative disorders such as cerebrovascular disease, chronic alcohol consumption, limbic encephalitis, medial temporal lobe epilepsy, and others. Co-occurrence of AD pathology with other neurodegenerative and vascular diseases is common and increases with age. This presents a challenge in current clinical practice due to a lack of reliable biomarkers for non-AD neurodegenerative diseases.",30925614,,10.1055/s-0039-1681041,39
Olfactory Dysfunction in Neurodegenerative Diseases,"Purpose of review:The sense of smell is today one of the focuses of interest in aging and neurodegenerative disease research. In several neurodegenerative diseases, such as Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease, the olfactory dysfunction is one of the initial symptoms appearing years before motor symptoms and cognitive decline, being considered a clinical marker of these diseases' early stages and a marker of disease progression and cognitive decline. Overall and under the umbrella of precision medicine, attention to olfactory function may help to improve chances of success for neuroprotective and disease-modifying therapeutic strategies.Recent findings:The use of olfaction, as clinical marker for neurodegenerative diseases is helpful in the characterization of prodromal stages of these diseases, early diagnostic strategies, differential diagnosis, and potentially prediction of treatment success. Understanding the mechanisms underlying olfactory dysfunction is central to determine its association with neurodegenerative disorders. Several anatomical systems and environmental factors may underlie or contribute to olfactory loss associated with neurological diseases, although the direct biological link to each disorder remains unclear and, thus, requires further investigation. In this review, we describe the neurobiology of olfaction, and the most common olfactory function measurements in neurodegenerative diseases. We also highlight the evidence for the presence of olfactory dysfunction in several neurodegenerative diseases, its value as a clinical marker for early stages of the diseases when combined with other clinical, biological, and neuroimage markers, and its role as a useful symptom for the differential diagnosis and follow-up of disease. The neuropathological correlations and the changes in neurotransmitter systems related with olfactory dysfunction in the neurodegenerative diseases are also described.",29904888,,10.1007/s11882-018-0796-4,103
Microglia in Alzheimer's disease,"Microglia are brain-resident myeloid cells that mediate key functions to support the CNS. Microglia express a wide range of receptors that act as molecular sensors, which recognize exogenous or endogenous CNS insults and initiate an immune response. In addition to their classical immune cell function, microglia act as guardians of the brain by promoting phagocytic clearance and providing trophic support to ensure tissue repair and maintain cerebral homeostasis. Conditions associated with loss of homeostasis or tissue changes induce several dynamic microglial processes, including changes of cellular morphology, surface phenotype, secretory mediators, and proliferative responses (referred to as an ""activated state""). Activated microglia represent a common pathological feature of several neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). Cumulative evidence suggests that microglial inflammatory activity in AD is increased while microglial-mediated clearance mechanisms are compromised. Microglia are perpetually engaged in a mutual interaction with the surrounding environment in CNS; thus, diverse microglial reactions at different disease stages may open new avenues for therapeutic intervention and modification of inflammatory activities. In this Review, the role of microglia in the pathogenesis of AD and the modulation of microglia activity as a therapeutic modality will be discussed.",28862638,PMC5669553,10.1172/JCI90606,395
"Frailty, Cognitive Decline, Neurodegenerative Diseases and Nutrition Interventions","Currently the human population is aging faster. This leads to higher dependency rates and the transformation of health and social care to adapt to this aged population. Among the changes developed by this population is frailty. It is defined as a clinically detectable syndrome, related to the aging of multiple physiological systems, which prompts a situation of vulnerability. The etiology of frailty seems to be multifactorial and its pathophysiology is influenced by the interaction of numerous factors. Morley et al. propose four main mechanisms triggering the frailty: atherosclerosis, sarcopenia, cognitive deterioration and malnutrition, with their respective metabolic alterations. Malnutrition is associated with cognitive impairment or functional loss, but it is also known that an inadequate nutritional status predisposes to cognitive frailty. Additionally, nutritional factors that may influence vascular risk factors will potentially have an effect on dementia decline among patients with cognitive frailty. This review aims to describe the nutritional factors that have been researched so far which may lead to the development of frailty, and especially cognitive decline.",31212645,PMC6600148,10.3390/ijms20112842,55
The DNA Methylation in Neurological Diseases,"DNA methylation is critical for the normal development and functioning of the human brain, such as the proliferation and differentiation of neural stem cells, synaptic plasticity, neuronal reparation, learning, and memory. Despite the physical stability of DNA and methylated DNA compared to other epigenetic modifications, some DNA methylation-based biomarkers have translated into clinical practice. Increasing reports indicate a strong association between DNA methylation profiles and various clinical outcomes in neurological diseases, making DNA methylation profiles valuable as novel clinical markers. In this review, we aim to discuss the latest evidence concerning DNA methylation alterations in the development of neurodegenerative, neurodevelopmental, and neuropsychiatric diseases. We also highlighted the relationship of DNA methylation alterations with the disease progression and outcome in many neurological diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, frontotemporal dementia, and autism.",36359835,PMC9657829,10.3390/cells11213439,14
Olfactory dysfunction in aging and neurodegenerative diseases,"Alterations in olfactory functions are proposed to be early biomarkers for neurodegeneration. Many neurodegenerative diseases are age-related, including two of the most common, Parkinson's disease (PD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). The establishment of biomarkers that promote early risk identification is critical for the implementation of early treatment to postpone or avert pathological development. Olfactory dysfunction (OD) is seen in 90% of early-stage PD patients and 85% of patients with early-stage AD, which makes it an attractive biomarker for early diagnosis of these diseases. Here, we systematically review widely applied smelling tests available for humans as well as olfaction assessments performed in some animal models and the relationships between OD and normal aging, PD, AD, and other conditions. The utility of OD as a biomarker for neurodegenerative disease diagnosis and future research directions are also discussed.",34325072,PMC8373788,10.1016/j.arr.2021.101416,43
Microglia in the Neuroinflammatory Pathogenesis of Alzheimer's Disease and Related Therapeutic Targets,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prevalent neurodegenerative disease worldwide, characterized by progressive neuron degeneration or loss due to excessive accumulation of β-amyloid (Aβ) peptides, formation of neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), and hyperphosphorylated tau. The treatment of AD has been only partially successful as the majority of the pharmacotherapies on the market may alleviate some of the symptoms. In the occurrence of AD, increasing attention has been paid to neurodegeneration, while the resident glial cells, like microglia are also observed. Microglia, a kind of crucial glial cells associated with the innate immune response, functions as double-edge sword role in CNS. They exert a beneficial or detrimental influence on the adjacent neurons through secretion of both pro-inflammatory cytokines as well as neurotrophic factors. In addition, their endocytosis of debris and toxic protein like Aβ and tau ensures homeostasis of the neuronal microenvironment. In this review, we will systematically summarize recent research regarding the roles of microglia in AD pathology and latest microglia-associated therapeutic targets mainly including pro-inflammatory genes, anti-inflammatory genes and phagocytosis at length, some of which are contradictory and controversial and warrant to further be investigated.",35558075,PMC9086828,10.3389/fimmu.2022.856376,33
Modeling Alzheimer's disease with iPSC-derived brain cells,"Alzheimer's disease is a devastating neurodegenerative disorder with no cure. Countless promising therapeutics have shown efficacy in rodent Alzheimer's disease models yet failed to benefit human patients. While hope remains that earlier intervention with existing therapeutics will improve outcomes, it is becoming increasingly clear that new approaches to understand and combat the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease are needed. Human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) technologies have changed the face of preclinical research and iPSC-derived cell types are being utilized to study an array of human conditions, including neurodegenerative disease. All major brain cell types can now be differentiated from iPSCs, while increasingly complex co-culture systems are being developed to facilitate neuroscience research. Many cellular functions perturbed in Alzheimer's disease can be recapitulated using iPSC-derived cells in vitro, and co-culture platforms are beginning to yield insights into the complex interactions that occur between brain cell types during neurodegeneration. Further, iPSC-based systems and genome editing tools will be critical in understanding the roles of the numerous new genes and mutations found to modify Alzheimer's disease risk in the past decade. While still in their relative infancy, these developing iPSC-based technologies hold considerable promise to push forward efforts to combat Alzheimer's disease and other neurodegenerative disorders.",31391546,PMC6906186,10.1038/s41380-019-0468-3,183
Apolipoprotein E in lipid metabolism and neurodegenerative disease,"Dysregulation of lipid metabolism has emerged as a central component of many neurodegenerative diseases. Variants of the lipid transport protein, apolipoprotein E (APOE), modulate risk and resilience in several neurodegenerative diseases including late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD). Allelic variants of the gene, APOE, alter the lipid metabolism of cells and tissues and have been broadly associated with several other cellular and systemic phenotypes. Targeting APOE-associated metabolic pathways may offer opportunities to alter disease-related phenotypes and consequently, attenuate disease risk and impart resilience to multiple neurodegenerative diseases. We review the molecular, cellular, and tissue-level alterations to lipid metabolism that arise from different APOE isoforms. These changes in lipid metabolism could help to elucidate disease mechanisms and tune neurodegenerative disease risk and resilience.",37357100,,10.1016/j.tem.2023.05.002,12
Ferroptosis as a mechanism of neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's disease,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prevalent form of dementia, with complex pathophysiology that is not fully understood. While β-amyloid plaque and neurofibrillary tangles define the pathology of the disease, the mechanism of neurodegeneration is uncertain. Ferroptosis is an iron-mediated programmed cell death mechanism characterised by phospholipid peroxidation that has been observed in clinical AD samples. This review will outline the growing molecular and clinical evidence implicating ferroptosis in the pathogenesis of AD, with implications for disease-modifying therapies.",34553778,,10.1111/jnc.15519,52
"Investigating Casual Associations Among Gut Microbiota, Metabolites, and Neurodegenerative Diseases: A Mendelian Randomization Study","Background:Recent studies had explored that gut microbiota was associated with neurodegenerative diseases (including Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)) through the gut-brain axis, among which metabolic pathways played an important role. However, the underlying causality remained unclear.Objective:Our study aimed to evaluate potential causal relationships between gut microbiota, metabolites, and neurodegenerative diseases through Mendelian randomization (MR) approach.Methods:We selected genetic variants associated with gut microbiota traits (N = 18,340) and gut microbiota-derived metabolites (N = 7,824) from genome-wide association studies. Summary statistics of neurodegenerative diseases were obtained from IGAP (AD, 17,008 cases; 37,154 controls), IPDGC (PD, 37,688 cases; 141,779 controls), and IALSC (ALS, 20,806 cases; 59,804 controls) respectively.Results:Greater abundance of Ruminococcus (OR, 1.245; 95% CI, 1.103-1.405; p = 0.0004) was found significantly related to higher risk of ALS. Besides, our study found suggestive associations of Actinobacteria, Lactobacillaceae, Faecalibacterium, Ruminiclostridium, and Lachnoclostridium with AD, of Lentisphaerae, Lentisphaeria, Oxalobacteraceae, Victivallales, Bacillales, Eubacteriumhalliigroup, Anaerostipes, and Clostridiumsensustricto1 with PD, and of Lachnospira, Fusicatenibacter, Catenibacterium, and Ruminococcusgnavusgroup with ALS. Our study also revealed suggestive associations between 12 gut microbiome-dependent metabolites and neurodegenerative diseases. Glutamine was related to lower risk of AD. For the serotonin pathway, serotonin was found as a protective factor of PD, while kynurenine as a risk factor for ALS.Conclusion:Our study firstly applied a two-sample MR approach to detect causal relationships among gut microbiota, gut metabolites, and neurodegenerative diseases. Our findings may provide new targets for treatments and may offer valuable insights for further studies on the underlying mechanisms.",35275534,,10.3233/JAD-215411,30
Epigenetic Modifications by Estrogen and Androgen in Alzheimer's Disease,"For the development and maintenance of neuron networks in the brain, epigenetic mechanisms are necessary, as indicated by recent findings. This includes some of the high-order brain processes, such as behavior and cognitive functions. Epigenetic mechanisms could influence the pathophysiology or etiology of some neuronal diseases, altering disease susceptibility and therapy responses. Recent studies support epigenetic dysfunctions in neurodegenerative and psychiatric conditions, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). These dysfunctions in epigenetic mechanisms also play crucial roles in the transgenerational effects of the environment on the brain and subsequently in the inheritance of pathologies. The possible role of gonadal steroids in the etiology and progression of neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease, has become the subject of a growing body of research over the last 20 years. Recent scientific findings suggest that epigenetic changes, driven by estrogen and androgens, play a vital role in brain functioning. Therefore, exploring the role of estrogen and androgen-based epigenetic changes in the brain is critical for the deeper understanding of AD. This review highlights the epigenetic modifications caused by these two gonadal steroids and the possible therapeutic strategies for AD.",35232367,,10.2174/1871527321666220225110501,1
TREM2: Potential therapeutic targeting of microglia for Alzheimer's disease,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disease, resulting in the loss of cognitive ability and memory. However, there is no specific treatment to mechanistically inhibit the progression of Alzheimer's disease, and most drugs only provide symptom relief and do not fundamentally reverse AD. Current studies show that triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2) is predominantly expressed in microglia of the central nervous system (CNS) and is involved in microglia proliferation, survival, migration and phagocytosis. The current academic view suggests that TREM2 and its ligands have CNS protective effects in AD. Specifically, TREM2 acts by regulating the function of microglia and promoting the clearance of neuronal toxic substances and abnormal proteins by microglia. In addition, TREM2 is also involved in regulating inflammatory response and cell signaling pathways, affecting the immune response and regulatory role of microglia. Although the relationship between TREM2 and Alzheimer's disease has been extensively studied, its specific mechanism of action is not fully understood. The purpose of this review is to provide a comprehensive analysis of the research of TREM2, including its regulation of the inflammatory response, lipid metabolism and phagocytosis in microglia of CNS in AD, and to explore the potential application prospects as well as limitations of targeting TREM2 for the treatment of AD.",37517293,,10.1016/j.biopha.2023.115218,3
Insulin signaling pathway and related molecules: Role in neurodegeneration and Alzheimer's disease,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is one of the most common neurodegenerative diseases. Its major pathological hallmarks, neurofibrillary tangles (NFT), and amyloid-β plaques can result from dysfunctional insulin signaling. Insulin is an important growth factor that regulates cell growth, energy utilization, mitochondrial function, autophagy, oxidative stress, synaptic plasticity, and cognitive function. Insulin and its downstream signaling molecules are located majorly in the regions of cortex and hippocampus. The major molecules involved in impaired insulin signaling include IRS, PI3K, Akt, and GSK-3β. Activation or inactivation of these major molecules through increased or decreased phosphorylation plays a role in insulin signaling abnormalities or insulin resistance. Insulin resistance, therefore, is considered as a major culprit in generating the hallmarks of AD arising from neuroinflammation and oxidative stress, etc. Moreover, caspases, Nrf2, and NF-κB influence this pathway in an indirect way. Various studies also suggest a strong link between Diabetes Mellitus and AD due to the impairment of insulin signaling pathway. Moreover, studies also depict a strong correlation of other neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's disease and Huntington's disease with insulin resistance. Hence this review will provide an insight into the role of insulin signaling pathway and related molecules as therapeutic targets in AD and other neurodegenerative diseases.",32092326,,10.1016/j.neuint.2020.104707,72
Revisiting the Cholinergic Hypothesis in Alzheimer's Disease: Emerging Evidence from Translational and Clinical Research,"Scientific evidence collected over the past 4 decades suggests that a loss of cholinergic innervation in the cerebral cortex of patients with Alzheimer's disease is an early pathogenic event correlated with cognitive impairment. This evidence led to the formulation of the ""Cholinergic Hypothesis of AD"" and the development of cholinesterase inhibitor therapies. Although approved only as symptomatic therapies, recent studies suggest that long-term use of these drugs may also have disease-modifying benefits. A Cholinergic System Workgroup reassessed the role of the cholinergic system on AD pathogenesis in light of recent data, including neuroimaging data charting the progression of neurodegeneration in the cholinergic system and suggesting that cholinergic therapy may slow brain atrophy. Other pathways that contribute to cholinergic synaptic loss and their effect on cognitive impairment in AD were also reviewed. These studies indicate that the cholinergic system as one of several interacting systems failures that contribute to AD pathogenesis.",30569080,,10.14283/jpad.2018.43,97
Mitophagy in Alzheimer's Disease and Other Age-Related Neurodegenerative Diseases,"Mitochondrial dysfunction is a central aspect of aging and neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and Huntington's disease. Mitochondria are the main cellular energy powerhouses, supplying most of ATP by oxidative phosphorylation, which is required to fuel essential neuronal functions. Efficient removal of aged and dysfunctional mitochondria through mitophagy, a cargo-selective autophagy, is crucial for mitochondrial maintenance and neuronal health. Mechanistic studies into mitophagy have highlighted an integrated and elaborate cellular network that can regulate mitochondrial turnover. In this review, we provide an updated overview of the recent discoveries and advancements on the mitophagy pathways and discuss the molecular mechanisms underlying mitophagy defects in Alzheimer's disease and other age-related neurodegenerative diseases, as well as the therapeutic potential of mitophagy-enhancing strategies to combat these disorders.",31936292,PMC7017092,10.3390/cells9010150,89
COVID-19 and risk of neurodegenerative disorders: A Mendelian randomization study,"Emerging evidence has suggested a close correlation between COVID-19 and neurodegenerative disorders. However, whether there exists a causal association and the effect direction remains unknown. To examine the causative role of COVID-19 in the risk of neurodegenerative disorders, we estimated their genetic correlation, and then conducted a two-sample Mendelian randomization analysis using summary statistics from genome-wide association studies of susceptibility, hospitalization, and severity of COVID-19, as well as six major neurodegenerative disorders including Alzheimer's disease (AD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, frontotemporal dementia, Lewy body dementia, multiple sclerosis, and Parkinson's disease. We identified a significant and positive genetic correlation between hospitalization of COVID-19 and AD (genetic correlation: 0.23, P = 8.36E-07). Meanwhile, hospitalization of COVID-19 was significantly associated with a higher risk of AD (OR: 1.02, 95% CI: 1.01-1.03, P: 1.19E-03). Consistently, susceptibility (OR: 1.05, 95% CI: 1.01-1.09, P: 9.30E-03) and severity (OR: 1.01, 95% CI: 1.00-1.02, P: 0.012) of COVID-19 were nominally associated with higher risk of AD. The results were robust under all sensitivity analyses. These results demonstrated that COVID-19 could increase the risk of AD. Future development of preventive or therapeutic interventions could attach importance to this to alleviate the complications of COVID-19.",35835752,PMC9281279,10.1038/s41398-022-02052-3,33
The cell biology of APOE in the brain,"Apolipoprotein E (APOE) traffics lipids in the central nervous system. The E4 variant of APOE is a major genetic risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD) and a multitude of other neurodegenerative diseases, yet the molecular mechanisms by which APOE4 drives disease are still unclear. A growing collection of studies in iPSC models, knock-in mice, and human postmortem brain tissue have demonstrated that APOE4 expression in astrocytes and microglia is associated with the accumulation of cytoplasmic lipid droplets, defects in endolysosomal trafficking, impaired mitochondrial metabolism, upregulation of innate immune pathways, and a transition into a reactive state. In this review, we collate these developments and suggest testable mechanistic hypotheses that could explain common APOE4 phenotypes.",37805344,,10.1016/j.tcb.2023.09.004,3
Nanomedicine for Neurodegenerative Disorders: Focus on Alzheimer's and Parkinson's Diseases,"Neurodegenerative disorders involve the slow and gradual degeneration of axons and neurons in the central nervous system (CNS), resulting in abnormalities in cellular function and eventual cellular demise. Patients with these disorders succumb to the high medical costs and the disruption of their normal lives. Current therapeutics employed for treating these diseases are deemed palliative. Hence, a treatment strategy that targets the disease's cause, not just the symptoms exhibited, is desired. The synergistic use of nanomedicine and gene therapy to effectively target the causative mutated gene/s in the CNS disease progression could provide the much-needed impetus in this battle against these diseases. This review focuses on Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases, the gene/s and proteins responsible for the damage and death of neurons, and the importance of nanomedicine as a potential treatment strategy. Multiple genes were identified in this regard, each presenting with various mutations. Hence, genome-wide sequencing is essential for specific treatment in patients. While a cure is yet to be achieved, genomic studies form the basis for creating a highly efficacious nanotherapeutic that can eradicate these dreaded diseases. Thus, nanomedicine can lead the way in helping millions of people worldwide to eventually lead a better life.",34445784,PMC8396516,10.3390/ijms22169082,19
Tau Oligomers,"The accumulation of tau filaments in neurons is a pathological hallmark of various neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease. However, it is not the filamentous aggregates themselves, but non-filamentous tau species, tau oligomer, that is thought to be the culprit in tau-mediated neurodegeneration. The definition of and methodology for isolating tau oligomers vary among researchers. Here we describe how tau oligomers are identified, summarize the differences of tau oligomers among research groups, and discuss their hypothesized functions.",32096050,,10.1007/978-981-32-9358-8_27,12
Mitophagy Regulates Neurodegenerative Diseases,"Mitochondria play an essential role in supplying energy for the health and survival of neurons. Mitophagy is a metabolic process that removes dysfunctional or redundant mitochondria. This process preserves mitochondrial health. However, defective mitophagy triggers the accumulation of damaged mitochondria, causing major neurodegenerative disorders. This review introduces molecular mechanisms and signaling pathways behind mitophagy regulation. Furthermore, we focus on the recent advances in understanding the potential role of mitophagy in the pathogenesis of major neurodegenerative diseases (Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, Huntington's, etc.) and aging. The findings will help identify the potential interventions of mitophagy regulation and treatment strategies of neurodegenerative diseases.",34440645,PMC8392649,10.3390/cells10081876,14

Epigenetic regulons in Alzheimer's disease,"Alzheimer's disease is one of the most prevalent forms of dementia that occur genetically or sporadically (with increasing age) in the population of 65 years and above. The pathological hallmarks of AD include the formation of extracellular senile plaques of amyloid beta peptides 42 (Aβ42) and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles associated with hyperphosphorylated tau protein. AD has been reported as an outcome of multiple probabilistic factors such as age, lifestyle, oxidative stress, inflammation, insulin resistance, mitochondrial dysfunction, and epigenetics. Epigenetics are heritable changes in gene expression that give a phenotype without altering the DNA sequences. Epigenetic mechanisms include DNA methylation, hydroxymethylation, histone modifications, regulation of miRNAs and long non-coding RNAs, which are reported to be dysregulated in AD. Further, epigenetic mechanisms have been shown as a key player as they regulate memory development, where DNA methylation and post-translational modifications of histone tails are the prime epigenetic markers. Also, alterations of AD-related genes cause pathogenesis on the transcriptional level. In the current chapter, we summarize the role of epigenetics in the onset and progression of AD and the use of epigenetic therapeutics to ameliorate the constraints of AD.",37225321,,10.1016/bs.pmbts.2023.01.012,0
Biomarkers in Neurodegenerative Diseases,"The past decade has seen tremendous efforts in biomarker discovery and validation for neurodegenerative diseases. The source and type of biomarkers has continued to grow for central nervous system diseases, from biofluid-based biomarkers (blood or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)), to nucleic acids, tissue, and imaging. While DNA remains a predominant biomarker used to identify familial forms of neurodegenerative diseases, various types of RNA have more recently been linked to familial and sporadic forms of neurodegenerative diseases during the past few years. Imaging approaches continue to evolve and are making major contributions to target engagement and early diagnostic biomarkers. Incorporation of biomarkers into drug development and clinical trials for neurodegenerative diseases promises to aid in the development and demonstration of target engagement and drug efficacy for neurologic disorders. This review will focus on recent advancements in developing biomarkers for clinical utility in Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).",28674995,,10.1007/978-3-319-57193-5_20,37
Neurodegenerative Diseases and Ageing,"This chapter describes the main neuropathological features of the most common age associated neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's disease, Lewy body diseases, vascular dementia and the various types of frontotemporal lobar degeneration. In addition, the more recent concepts of primary age-related tauopathy and ageing-related tau astrogliopathy as well as chronic traumatic encephalopathy are briefly described. One section is dedicated to cerebral multi-morbidity as it is becoming increasingly clear that the old brain is characterised by the presence of multiple pathologies (to varying extent) rather than by one single, disease specific pathology alone. The main aim of this chapter is to inform the reader about the neuropathological basics of age associated neurodegenerative diseases as we feel this is crucial to meaningfully interpret the vast literature that is published in the broad field of dementia research.",30888650,,10.1007/978-981-13-3681-2_4,7
Mitophagy in neurodegenerative diseases,"Neurodegenerative diseases, such as Parkinson's disease (PD), Alzheimer's disease (AD), Huntington's disease (HD), and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), are a complex ""family"" of pathologies, characterised by the progressive loss of neurons and/or neuronal functions, leading to severe physical and cognitive inabilities in affected patients. These syndromes, despite differences in the causative events, the onset, and the progression of the disease, share as common features the presence of aggregate-prone neuro-toxic proteins, in the form of aggresomes and/or inclusion bodies, perturbing cellular homeostasis and neuronal function (Popovic et al., 2014), and the presence of dysfunctional mitochondria. The removal of protein aggregates and of damaged organelles, through the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) and/or the autophagy/lysosome machinery, is a crucial step for the maintenance of neuronal homeostasis. Indeed, their impairment has been reported as associated with the development of these diseases. In this review, we focus on the role played by mitophagy, a specialised form of autophagy, in the onset and progression of major neurodegenerative diseases, as well as on possible therapeutic approaches involving mitophagy modulation.",28797885,,10.1016/j.neuint.2017.08.004,51
Neurodegeneration and epigenetics: A review,"Neuronal function and differentiation are tightly regulated by both genome and epigenome. Based on the environmental information the epigenetic changes occur. Neurodegeneration is the consequence of dysregulation of both the genome and epigenome. In this study, we saw different types of alterations of epigenome present in neuronal cells of different model organisms for neurodegenerative disorders. The epigenetic modifications including chromatin modification, DNA methylation, and changes in regulatory RNAs (miRNA) are having a great impact on neurodegenerative disorders as well as memory. The effects of these re-editing in the neuronal cells cause Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease but an unusual form of neuroepigenetics has been seen in Prion Disease. Subsequently, for the development of treatment of these diseases, epigenetic modifications should be kept in mind. Although until now many reports came on drug discovery inhibiting histone deacetylases and DNA methyltransferases to reverse the epigenetic change but they lack targeted delivery and sometimes cause a cytotoxic effect on neuronal cells. In future, advancement in targeted and non-cytotoxic drugs should be the main focus for therapeutic treatment of the neurodegenerative disorders.",37344098,,10.1016/j.nrleng.2023.05.001,5
Epigenetics and pharmacology,"Recent advances in the understanding of gene regulation have shown there to be much more regulation of the genome than first thought, through epigenetic mechanisms. These epigenetic mechanisms are systems that have evolved to either switch off gene activity altogether, or fine-tune any existing genetic activation. Such systems are present in all genes and include chromatin modifications and remodelling, DNA methylation (such as CpG island methylation rates) and histone covalent modifications (e.g. acetylation, methylation), RNA interference by short interfering RNAs (siRNAs) and long non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs). These systems regulate genomic activity 'beyond' simple transcriptional factor inducer or repressor function of genes to generate mRNA. Epigenetic regulation of gene activity has been shown to be important in maintaining normal phenotypic activity of cells, as well as having a role in development and diseases such as cancer and neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's. Newer classes of drugs regulate epigenetic mechanisms to counteract disease states in humans. The reports in this issue describe some advances in epigenetic understanding that relate to human disease, and our ability to control these mechanisms by pharmacological means. Increasingly the importance of epigenetics is being uncovered - it is pharmacology that will have to keep pace.",25966315,PMC4439868,10.1111/bph.13136,9
Epigenetics and DNA methylomic profiling in Alzheimer's disease and other neurodegenerative diseases,"Recent studies have suggested a role for epigenetic mechanisms in the complex etiology of various neurodegenerative diseases. In this review, we discuss advances that have been made toward understanding the role of epigenetic processes in neurodegenerative disorders, with a particular focus on Alzheimer's disease, where the most extensive studies have been undertaken to date. We provide a brief overview of DNA modifications, followed by a summarization of studies of DNA modifications in Alzheimer's disease and other neurodegenerative diseases.",28805248,,10.1111/jnc.14148,36
Ultra-Early Phase pathologies of Alzheimer's disease and other neurodegenerative diseases,"The concept of neurodegenerative diseases and the therapeutics targeting these intractable diseases are changing rapidly. Protein aggregation as the top of pathological cascade is now challenged, and many alternative ideas are proposed. Early molecular pathologies before microscopic detection of diseases protein aggregates, which I propose to call ""Ultra-Early Phase pathologies or phase 0 pathologies"", are the focus of research that might explain the failures of clinical trials with anti-Aβ antibodies against Alzheimer's disease. In this review article, I summarize the critical issues that should be successfully and consistently answered by a new concept of neurodegeneration. For reevaluating old concepts and reconstructing a new concept of neurodegeneration that will replace the old ones, non-biased comprehensive approaches including proteome combined with systems biology analyses will be a powerful tool. I introduce our recent efforts in this orientation that have reached to the stage of non-clinical proof of concept applicable to clinical trials.",28603208,PMC5709537,10.2183/pjab.93.022,5
Neuroprotective Role of Phytochemicals,"Neurodegenerative diseases are normally distinguished as disorders with loss of neurons. Various compounds are being tested to treat neurodegenerative diseases (NDs) but they possess solitary symptomatic advantages with numerous side effects. Accumulative studies have been conducted to validate the benefit of phytochemicals to treat neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD). In this present review we explored the potential efficacy of phytochemicals such as epigallocatechin-3-galate, berberin, curcumin, resveratrol, quercetin and limonoids against the most common NDs, including Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD). The beneficial potentials of these phytochemicals have been demonstrated by evidence-based but more extensive investigation needs to be conducted for reducing the progression of AD and PD.",30262792,PMC6222499,10.3390/molecules23102485,41
Epigenetics and the neurodegenerative process,"Neurological diseases are multifactorial, genetic and environmental. Environmental factors such as diet, physical activity and emotional state are epigenetic factors. Environmental markers are responsible for epigenetic modifications. The effect of epigenetic changes is increased inflammation of the nervous system and neuronal damage. In recent years, it has been shown that epigenetic changes may cause an increased risk of neurological disorders but, currently, the relationship between epigenetic modifications and neurodegeneration remains unclear. This review summarizes current knowledge about neurological disorders caused by epigenetic changes in diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, stroke and epilepsy. Advances in epigenetic techniques may be key to understanding the epigenetics of central changes in neurological diseases.",38511224,,10.2217/epi-2023-0416,0
Epigenetic Regulation of Neuroinflammation in Alzheimer's Disease,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a chronic and progressive neurodegenerative disease and clinically manifests with cognitive decline and behavioral disabilities. Over the past years, mounting studies have demonstrated that the inflammatory response plays a key role in the onset and development of AD, and neuroinflammation has been proposed as the third major pathological driving factor of AD, ranking after the two well-known core pathologies, amyloid β (Aβ) deposits and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs). Epigenetic mechanisms, referring to heritable changes in gene expression independent of DNA sequence alterations, are crucial regulators of neuroinflammation which have emerged as potential therapeutic targets for AD. Upon regulation of transcriptional repression or activation, epigenetic modification profiles are closely involved in inflammatory gene expression and signaling pathways of neuronal differentiation and cognitive function in central nervous system disorders. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge about epigenetic control mechanisms with a focus on DNA and histone modifications involved in the regulation of inflammatory genes and signaling pathways in AD, and the inhibitors under clinical assessment are also discussed.",38201283,PMC10778497,10.3390/cells13010079,1
Photobiomodulation for Hypertension and Alzheimer's Disease,"Although the cause(s) of Alzheimer's disease in the majority of cases remains elusive, it has long been associated with hypertension. In animal models of the disease, hypertension has been shown to exacerbate Alzheimer-like pathology and behavior, while in humans, hypertension during mid-life increases the risk of developing the disease later in life. Unfortunately, once individuals are diagnosed with the disease, there are few therapeutic options available. There is neither an effective symptomatic treatment, one that treats the debilitating cognitive and memory deficits, nor, more importantly, a neuroprotective treatment, one that stops the relentless progression of the pathology. Further, there is no specific preventative treatment that offsets the onset of the disease. A key factor or clue in this quest for an effective preventative and therapeutic treatment may lie in the contribution of hypertension to the disease. In this review, we explore the idea that photobiomodulation, the application of specific wavelengths of light onto body tissues, can reduce the neuropathology and behavioral deficits in Alzheimer's disease by controlling hypertension. We suggest that treatment with photobiomodulation can be an effective preventative and therapeutic option for this neurodegenerative disease.",36189597,PMC9741744,10.3233/JAD-220632,5
Potential Epigenetic Targets for Combating Alzheimer's Disease,"Memory remains an obligatory regime of the human brain, and impaired memory causes serious obstacles in our everyday life. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is one such neurodegenerative disease which mostly affects the elderly population, above the age of 60; marked by cognitive impairment of memory. Besides the known targets of AD against the several etiologies known to date, the zone of epigenetics has recently evolved as an ingenious field in AD. Epigenetic modifications do not affect DNA sequence but only long-term gene expression. Considering the complex multifactorial nature of AD, we herein discuss the various epigenetic targets which might give rise to potential therapeutic approaches. We reviewed the possible epigenetic targets for AD-like HDAC, Sirtuins, glial cells, miRNA and epigenetic modifications like DNA methylation. A deeper insight into these target areas can surely evolve AD diagnosis and therapeutics.",33371834,,10.2174/1389557521999201228191427,1

Cell therapy, gene therapy, nanomedicine as choices used to cure neurodegenerative disease. Recently, studies related to the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders have been focused on stem cell therapy and Nano-drugs beyond other than regenerative medicine. Hence, by data from experimental models and clinical trials, we review the impact of stem cell therapy, gene therapy, and nanomedicine on the treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), and Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Indeed, improved knowledge and continued research on gene therapy and nanomedicine in treating Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis lead to advancements in effective and practical treatments for neurodegenerative diseases.",36527565,,10.1007/s10561-022-10062-0,0
Peripheral Glycolysis in Neurodegenerative Diseases,"Neurodegenerative diseases are a group of nervous system conditions characterised pathologically by the abnormal deposition of protein throughout the brain and spinal cord. One common pathophysiological change seen in all neurodegenerative disease is a change to the metabolic function of nervous system and peripheral cells. Glycolysis is the conversion of glucose to pyruvate or lactate which results in the generation of ATP and has been shown to be abnormal in peripheral cells in Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis. Changes to the glycolytic pathway are seen early in neurodegenerative disease and highlight how in multiple neurodegenerative conditions pathology is not always confined to the nervous system. In this paper, we review the abnormalities described in glycolysis in the three most common neurodegenerative diseases. We show that in all three diseases glycolytic changes are seen in fibroblasts, and red blood cells, and that liver, kidney, muscle and white blood cells have abnormal glycolysis in certain diseases. We highlight there is potential for peripheral glycolysis to be developed into multiple types of disease biomarker, but large-scale bio sampling and deciphering how glycolysis is inherently altered in neurodegenerative disease in multiple patients' needs to be accomplished first to meet this aim.",33255513,PMC7727792,10.3390/ijms21238924,26
[Treatment-Quo vadis neurodegeneration?],"Background:Hallmarks of neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease are pathological protein aggregation, neuroinflammation, neurodegeneration and progressive symptoms. Due to the limited causal treatment options they represent a big challenge.Objective:Overview of disease-modifying strategies in neurodegenerative diseases and outlook regarding future treatment development.Material and methods:Literature search regarding treatment development in neurodegenerative diseases and integration of the results. Additionally, consideration of expert opinions.Results:The development of biomarkers and genetic parameters for the detection of causal pathologies of neurodegenerative diseases as an indispensable basis for the development of disease-modifying treatment is rapidly advancing. Targets for causal interventions are all steps in the pathophysiological cascade of neurodegenerative diseases. Therapeutic antibodies are most advanced in the development and are able to remove protein deposits from the brain and to reduce the clinical progression in Alzheimer's disease. A combination of biomarkers, genetic characteristics and clinical parameters could enable an individualized treatment.Conclusion:The future of the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases focuses on disease modification using molecular-based approaches. Targeted interventions against protein aggregation, inflammation and genetic factors as well as a personalized stratification of treatment hold promise for more effective forms of treatment. Although challenges still remain, current research and clinical studies give optimism for the development of disease-modifying treatment for neurodegenerative diseases.",37801166,,10.1007/s00115-023-01544-x,0
Genomic mechanisms in Alzheimer's disease,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disease and, owing to its increasing prevalence, represents one of the leading public health problems in aging populations. The molecular causes underlying the onset and progression of AD are manifold and hitherto still incompletely understood. Research over nearly four decades has clearly delineated genetics to play a crucial role in AD susceptibility, likely in concert with non-genetic factors. The field has gained considerable momentum and novel insights over the past 10 years owing to the advent and application of high-throughput genomics technologies in datasets of increasing size. In this contribution to the Mini-Symposium on the Molecular Etiology of Alzheimer's Disease, we review the current status of genomics research in AD. To this end, we scrutinize and discuss the main findings from the two largest and most current genome-wide association studies (GWAS) in the field, that is, the papers published by Jansen et al (Nat Genet 51:404-413) and Kunkle et al (Nat Genet 51:414-430). Particular focus is laid on genomics findings overlapping across both studies and on the novel insights they provide in terms of improving our understanding of the ""genomic mechanisms"" underlying this devastating disease.",32657454,PMC8018017,10.1111/bpa.12882,18
Alzheimer's disease and the autophagic-lysosomal system,"Age-related neurodegenerative diseases are of critical concern to the general population and research/medical community due to their health impact and socioeconomic consequences. A feature of most, if not all, neurodegenerative disorders is the presence of proteinopathies, in which misfolded or conformationally altered proteins drive disease progression and are often used as a primary neuropathological marker of disease. In particular, Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by abnormal accumulation of protein aggregates, primarily extracellular plaques composed of the Aβ peptide and intracellular tangles comprised of the tau protein, both of which may indicate a primary defect in protein clearance. Protein degradation is a key cellular mechanism for protein homeostasis and is essential for cell survival but is disrupted in neurodegenerative diseases. Dysregulation in proteolytic pathways - mainly the autophagic-lysosomal system (A-LS) and the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) - has been increasingly associated with proteinopathies in neurodegenerative diseases. Here we review the role of dysfunctional autophagy underlying AD-related proteinopathy and discuss how to model this aspect of disease, as well as summarize recent advances in translational strategies for targeted A-LS dysfunction in AD.",29758300,,10.1016/j.neulet.2018.05.017,28
Peripheral Inflammatory Biomarkers of Alzheimer's Disease,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease of unknown pathological origin. The clinical diagnosis of AD is time-consuming and needs to a combination of clinical evaluation, psychological testing, and imaging assessments. Biomarkers may be good indicators for the clinical diagnosis of AD; hence, it is important to identify suitable biomarkers for the diagnosis and treatment of AD. Peripheral inflammatory biomarkers have been the focus of research in recent years. This review summarizes the role of inflammatory biomarkers in the disease course of AD.",35599478,,10.3233/JAD-215422,1
Alzheimer's Disorder: Epigenetic Connection and Associated Risk Factors,"The gene based therapeutics and drug targets have shown incredible and appreciable advances in alleviating human sufferings and complexities. Epigenetics simply means above genetics or which controls the organism beyond genetics. At present it is very clear that all characteristics of an individual are not determined by DNA alone, rather the environment, stress, life style and nutrition play a vital part in determining the response of an organism. Thus, nature (genetic makeup) and nurture (exposure) play equally important roles in the responses observed, both at the cellular and organism levels. Epigenetics influence plethora of complications at cellular and molecular levels that includes cancer, metabolic and cardiovascular complications including neurological (psychosis) and neurodegenerative disorders (Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson disease etc.). The epigenetic mechanisms include DNA methylation, histone modification and non coding RNA which have substantial impact on progression and pathways linked to Alzheimer's disease. The epigenetic mechanism gets deregulated in Alzheimer's disease and is characterized by DNA hyper methylation, deacetylation of histones and general repressed chromatin state which alter gene expression at the transcription level by upregulation, downregulation or silencing of genes. Thus, the processes or modulators of these epigenetic processes have shown vast potential as a therapeutic target in Alzheimer's disease.",31989902,PMC7536832,10.2174/1570159X18666200128125641,27
Connexins and pannexins in Alzheimer's disease,"By 2040 neurodegenerative diseases will become the world's second leading cause of death after cardiovascular disease (WHO). Major efforts are required to elucidate the underlying molecular and cellular mechanisms of neurodegenerative diseases. Connexin and pannexin membrane channel proteins are conduits through which neuronal, glial, and vascular tissues interact. In the normal brain, this interaction underlies homeostasis, metabolic supply and neuroprotection. In models of neuroinflammation these channels present aberrant functioning. Validation of the molecular mechanisms by which these membrane channels influence neurodegeneration particularly in Alzheimer's disease could lead to new and alternative therapeutic strategies targeting these channels.",28893592,,10.1016/j.neulet.2017.09.006,18
The aging immune system in Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases,"The neurodegenerative diseases Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD) both have a myriad of risk factors including genetics, environmental exposures, and lifestyle. However, aging is the strongest risk factor for both diseases. Aging also profoundly influences the immune system, with immunosenescence perhaps the most prominent outcome. Through genetics, mouse models, and pathology, there is a growing appreciation of the role the immune system plays in neurodegenerative diseases. In this review, we explore the intersection of aging and the immune system in AD and PD.",35505128,PMC9519729,10.1007/s00281-022-00944-6,8
Modeling neurodegenerative diseases with cerebral organoids and other three-dimensional culture systems: focus on Alzheimer's disease,"Many neurodegenerative diseases (NDs) such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, frontotemporal dementia, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and Huntington's disease, are characterized by the progressive accumulation of abnormal proteinaceous assemblies in specific cell types and regions of the brain, leading to cellular dysfunction and brain damage. Although animal- and in vitro-based studies of NDs have provided the field with an extensive understanding of some of the mechanisms underlying these diseases, findings from these studies have not yielded substantial progress in identifying treatment options for patient populations. This necessitates the development of complementary model systems that are better suited to recapitulate human-specific features of ND pathogenesis. Three-dimensional (3D) culture systems, such as cerebral organoids generated from human induced pluripotent stem cells, hold significant potential to model NDs in a complex, tissue-like environment. In this review, we discuss the advantages of 3D culture systems and 3D modeling of NDs, especially AD and FTD. We also provide an overview of the challenges and limitations of the current 3D culture systems. Finally, we propose a few potential future directions in applying state-of-the-art technologies in 3D culture systems to understand the mechanisms of NDs and to accelerate drug discovery.

Epigenetic regulation in Alzheimer's disease: is it a potential therapeutic target?,"Introduction: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disorder and the primary form of dementia in the elderly. Changes in DNA methylation and post-translational modifications of histone tails are increasingly observed in AD tissues, and likely contribute to disease onset and progression. The reversibility of these epigenetic marks offers the potential for therapeutic interventions.Areas covered: After a concise and updated overview of DNA methylation and post-translational modifications of histone tails in AD tissues, this review provides an overview of the animal and cell culture studies investigating the potential of targeting these modifications to attenuate AD-like features. PubMed was searched for relevant literature between 2003 and 2021.Expert opinion: Methyl donor compounds and drugs acting on histone tail modifications attenuated the AD-like features and improved cognition in several transgenic AD mice; however, there are concerns about safety and tolerability for long-term treatment in humans. The challenges will be to take advantage of recent epigenome-wide investigations to identify the principal targets for future interventions, and to design novel, selective and safer agents. Natural compounds exerting epigenetic properties could represent a promising opportunity to delay disease onset in middle-aged individuals at increased AD risk.",33843425,,10.1080/14728222.2021.1916469,9
Alzheimer's Disease-Related Epigenetic Changes: Novel Therapeutic Targets,"Aging is a significant risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD), although the precise mechanism and molecular basis of AD are not yet fully understood. Epigenetic mechanisms, such as DNA methylation and hydroxymethylation, mitochondrial DNA methylation, histone modifications, and non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs), play a role in regulating gene expression related to neuron plasticity and integrity, which are closely associated with learning and memory development. This review describes the impact of dynamic and reversible epigenetic modifications and factors on memory and plasticity throughout life, emphasizing their potential as target for therapeutic intervention in AD. Additionally, we present insight from postmortem and animal studies on abnormal epigenetics regulation in AD, as well as current strategies aiming at targeting these factors in the context of AD therapy.",37700216,,10.1007/s12035-023-03626-y,2
Blood Transcript Biomarkers Selected by Machine Learning Algorithm Classify Neurodegenerative Diseases including Alzheimer's Disease,"The clinical diagnosis of neurodegenerative diseases is notoriously inaccurate and current methods are often expensive, time-consuming, or invasive. Simple inexpensive and noninvasive methods of diagnosis could provide valuable support for clinicians when combined with cognitive assessment scores. Biological processes leading to neuropathology progress silently for years and are reflected in both the central nervous system and vascular peripheral system. A blood-based screen to distinguish and classify neurodegenerative diseases is especially interesting having low cost, minimal invasiveness, and accessibility to almost any world clinic. In this study, we set out to discover a small set of blood transcripts that can be used to distinguish healthy individuals from those with Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Friedreich's ataxia, or frontotemporal dementia. Using existing public datasets, we developed a machine learning algorithm for application on transcripts present in blood and discovered small sets of transcripts that distinguish a number of neurodegenerative diseases with high sensitivity and specificity. We validated the usefulness of blood RNA transcriptomics for the classification of neurodegenerative diseases. Information about features selected for the classification can direct the development of possible treatment strategies.",36358942,PMC9687215,10.3390/biom12111592,3
Glymphatic system dysfunction in neurodegenerative diseases,"Purpose of review:Purpose of this review is to update the ongoing work in the field of glymphatic and neurodegenerative research and to highlight focus areas that are particularly promising.Recent findings:Multiple reports have over the past decade documented that glymphatic fluid transport is broadly suppressed in neurodegenerative diseases. Most studies have focused on Alzheimer's disease using a variety of preclinical disease models, whereas the clinical work is based on various neuroimaging approaches. It has consistently been reported that brain fluid transport is impaired in patients suffering from Alzheimer's disease compared with age-matched control subjects.Summary:An open question in the field is to define the mechanistic underpinning of why glymphatic function is suppressed. Other questions include the opportunities for using glymphatic imaging for diagnostic purposes and in treatment intended to prevent or slow Alzheimer disease progression.",38345416,,10.1097/WCO.0000000000001252,2
Chaperoning shape-shifting tau in disease,"Many neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's, originate from the conversion of proteins into pathogenic conformations. The microtubule-associated protein tau converts into β-sheet-rich amyloid conformations, which underlie pathology in over 25 related tauopathies. Structural studies of tau amyloid fibrils isolated from human tauopathy tissues have revealed that tau adopts diverse structural polymorphs, each linked to a different disease. Molecular chaperones play central roles in regulating tau function and amyloid assembly in disease. New data supports the model that chaperones selectively recognize different conformations of tau to limit the accumulation of proteotoxic species. The challenge now is to understand how chaperones influence disease processes across different tauopathies, which will help guide the development of novel conformation-specific diagnostic and therapeutic strategies.",35045944,,10.1016/j.tibs.2021.12.009,8
Eye movements in neurodegenerative diseases,"Purpose of review:Abnormalities of oculomotor control accompany the pathological changes underlying many neurodegenerative diseases. Clinical examination of eye movements can contribute to differential diagnosis, whereas quantitative laboratory measures can provide detailed insight into the disease process. In this review of eye movements in neurodegenerative disease, we summarise recent empirical findings and conceptual advances.Recent findings:Oculomotor researchers continue to be particularly prolific in studying Parkinson's disease but there is also substantial activity in Alzheimer's disease and spinocerebellar ataxia. Interesting findings have been reported in Huntington's, motor neuron disease, and glaucoma. Most studies report laboratory-based investigations but useful progress in clinical description continues to be made.Summary:Eye movements remain an active field of investigation across a variety of neurodegenerative conditions. Progress continues to be made at the clinical level as well by using laboratory techniques.",26641817,,10.1097/WCO.0000000000000274,36
Translational Research in Alzheimer's and Prion Diseases,"Translational neuroscience integrates the knowledge derived by basic neuroscience with the development of new diagnostic and therapeutic tools that may be applied to clinical practice in neurological diseases. This information can be used to improve clinical trial designs and outcomes that will accelerate drug development, and to discover novel biomarkers which can be efficiently employed to early recognize neurological disorders and provide information regarding the effects of drugs on the underlying disease biology. Alzheimer's disease (AD) and prion disease are two classes of neurodegenerative disorders characterized by incomplete knowledge of the molecular mechanisms underlying their occurrence and the lack of valid biomarkers and effective treatments. For these reasons, the design of therapies that prevent or delay the onset, slow the progression, or improve the symptoms associated to these disorders is urgently needed. During the last few decades, translational research provided a framework for advancing development of new diagnostic devices and promising disease-modifying therapies for patients with prion encephalopathies and AD. In this review, we provide present evidence of how supportive can be the translational approach to the study of dementias and show some results of our preclinical studies which have been translated to the clinical application following the 'bed-to-bench-and-back' research model.",29172000,PMC5869996,10.3233/JAD-170770,5
Chemosensory dysfunction in neurodegenerative diseases,"A number of neurodegenerative diseases are accompanied by disordered smell function. The degree of dysfunction can vary among different diseases, such that olfactory testing can aid in differentiating, for example, Alzheimer's disease (AD) from major affective disorder and Parkinson's disease (PD) from progressive supranuclear palsy. Unfortunately, altered smell function often goes unrecognized by patients and physicians alike until formal testing is undertaken. Such testing uniquely probes brain regions not commonly examined in physical examinations and can identify, in some cases, patients who are already in the ""preclinical"" stage of disease. Awareness of this fact is one reason why the Quality Standards Committee of the American Academy of Neurology has designated smell dysfunction as one of the key diagnostic criteria for PD. The same recommendation has been made by the Movement Disorder Society for both the diagnosis of PD and identification of prodromal PD. Similar suggestions are proposed to include olfactory dysfunction as an additional research criterion for the diagnosis of AD. Although taste impairment, i.e., altered sweet, sour, bitter, salty, and umami perception, has also been demonstrated in some disorders, taste has received much less scientific attention than smell. In this review, we assess what is known about the smell and taste disorders of a wide range of neurodegenerative diseases and describe studies seeking to understand their pathologic underpinnings.",31604557,,10.1016/B978-0-444-63855-7.00020-4,39
Exploring the Genetic Predisposition to Epigenetic Changes in Alzheimer's Disease,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a prevalent type of dementia in elderly populations with a significant genetic component. The accumulating evidence suggests that AD involves a reconfiguration of the epigenetic landscape, including DNA methylation, post-translational modification of histone proteins, and chromatin remodeling. Along with environmental factors, individual specific genetic features play a considerable role in the formation of epigenetic architecture. In this study, we attempt to identify the non-coding regulatory SNPs (rSNPs) able to affect the epigenetic mechanisms in AD. To this end, the multi-omics approach is used. The GEO (Gene Expression Omnibus) available data (GSE153875) for AD patients and controls are integrated to reveal the rSNPs that display allele-specific features in both ChIP-seq profiles of four histone modifications and RNA-seq. Furthermore, we analyze the presence of rSNPs in the promoters of genes reported to be differentially expressed between AD and the normal brain (AD-related genes) and involved in epigenetic regulation according to the EpiFactors database. We also searched for the rSNPs in the promoters of the genes coding for transcription regulators of the identified AD-related genes. These regulators were selected based on the corresponding ChIP-seq peaks (ENCODE) in the promoter regions of these genes. Finally, we formed a panel of rSNPs localized to the promoters of genes that contribute to the epigenetic landscape in AD and, thus, to the genetic predisposition for this disease.",37175659,PMC10177989,10.3390/ijms24097955,1
Roles of Siglecs in neurodegenerative diseases,"Microglia are resident myeloid cells in the central nervous system (CNS) with a unique developmental origin, playing essential roles in developing and maintaining the CNS environment. Recent studies have revealed the involvement of microglia in neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease, through the modulation of neuroinflammation. Several members of the Siglec family of sialic acid recognition proteins are expressed on microglia. Since the discovery of the genetic association between a polymorphism in the CD33 gene and late-onset Alzheimer's disease, significant efforts have been made to elucidate the molecular mechanism underlying the association between the polymorphism and Alzheimer's disease. Furthermore, recent studies have revealed additional potential associations between Siglecs and Alzheimer's disease, implying that the reduced signal from inhibitory Siglec may have an overall protective effect in lowering the disease risk. Evidences suggesting the involvement of Siglecs in other neurodegenerative diseases are also emerging. These findings could help us predict the roles of Siglecs in other neurodegenerative diseases. However, little is known about the functionally relevant Siglec ligands in the brain, which represents a new frontier. Understanding how microglial Siglecs and their ligands in CNS contribute to the regulation of CNS homeostasis and pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases may provide us with a new avenue for disease prevention and intervention.",36089405,,10.1016/j.mam.2022.101141,4
The impact of obesity on neurodegenerative diseases,"Neurodegenerative diseases are a growing health concern. The increasing incidences of these disorders have a great impact on the patients' quality of life. Although the mechanisms of neurodegenerative diseases are still far from being clarified, several studies look for new discoveries about their pathophysiology and prevention. Furthermore, evidence has shown a strong correlation between obesity and the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD). Metabolic changes caused by overweight are related to damage to the central nervous system (CNS), which can lead to neural death, either by apoptosis or cell necrosis, as well as alter the synaptic plasticity of the neuron. This review aims to show the association between neurodegenerative diseases, focusing on AD and PD, and metabolic alterations.",28583368,,10.1016/j.lfs.2017.06.002,70
Understanding Epigenetic Alterations in Alzheimer's and Parkinson's Disease: Towards Targeted Biomarkers and Therapies,"Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease represent the two most common neurodegenerative disorders, affecting an increasing number of patients worldwide. Population ageing and lack of effective therapies and biomarkers strongly contribute to the socio-economical impact of these conditions. Message and Conclusion: The aim of the review is to present a summary of the discoveries made on the epigenetics of Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease, with a special focus on the recent advances towards the identification of new targeted therapies and biomarkers. Data supporting broad spectrum and selective small-molecule inhibition of enzymes controlling DNA methylation and histone modifications are discussed in the context of Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease. The results obtained from studies performed on patients samples are also mentioned, to provide a picture of the efforts made toward identification of epigenetic-based biomarkers. Finally, given the importance of non-coding RNAs in neurodegeneration, their contribution to Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease will be examined, together with a brief summary of the available miRNA-based biomarker signatures for these two conditions.",28120717,,10.2174/1381612823666170124121140,11
D-ribose and pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease,"It is estimated that the global prevalence of dementia will rise as high as 24 million and predicted to be double in every 20 years which is attributed to the fact that the ageing population is increasing and so more individuals are at risk of developing neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's. Many scientists favored glycation of proteins such as tau, amyloid beta (Aβ) etc. as one of the important risk factor in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Since, D-ribose shows highest glycation ability among other sugars hence, produces advanced glycation end products (AGEs) rapidly. However, there are several other mechanisms suggested by researchers through which D-ribose may cause cognitive impairments. There is a concern related to diabetic patients since they also suffer from D-ribose metabolism, may be more prone to AD risk. Thus, it is imperative that the pathogenesis and the pathways involved in AD progression are explored in the light of ribosylation and AGEs formation for identifying suitable diagnostics marker for early diagnosis or finding promising therapeutic outcomes.",31933261,,10.1007/s11033-020-05243-7,8
Histone Methylation Regulation in Neurodegenerative Disorders,"Advances achieved with molecular biology and genomics technologies have permitted investigators to discover epigenetic mechanisms, such as DNA methylation and histone posttranslational modifications, which are critical for gene expression in almost all tissues and in brain health and disease. These advances have influenced much interest in understanding the dysregulation of epigenetic mechanisms in neurodegenerative disorders. Although these disorders diverge in their fundamental causes and pathophysiology, several involve the dysregulation of histone methylation-mediated gene expression. Interestingly, epigenetic remodeling via histone methylation in specific brain regions has been suggested to play a critical function in the neurobiology of psychiatric disorders, including that related to neurodegenerative diseases. Prominently, epigenetic dysregulation currently brings considerable interest as an essential player in neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), Huntington's disease (HD), Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and drugs of abuse, including alcohol abuse disorder, where it may facilitate connections between genetic and environmental risk factors or directly influence disease-specific pathological factors. We have discussed the current state of histone methylation, therapeutic strategies, and future perspectives for these disorders. While not somatically heritable, the enzymes responsible for histone methylation regulation, such as histone methyltransferases and demethylases in neurons, are dynamic and reversible. They have become promising potential therapeutic targets to treat or prevent several neurodegenerative disorders. These findings, along with clinical data, may provide links between molecular-level changes and behavioral differences and provide novel avenues through which the epigenome may be targeted early on in people at risk for neurodegenerative disorders.",33925016,PMC8125694,10.3390/ijms22094654,23
Ghrelin and Neurodegenerative Disorders-a Review,"Ghrelin, the endogenous ligand of the growth hormone secretagogue receptor 1a (GHS-R1a), is a gut-derived, orexigenic peptide hormone that primarily regulates growth hormone secretion, food intake, and energy homeostasis. With the wide expression of GHS-R1a in extra-hypothalamic regions, the physiological role of ghrelin is more extensive than solely its involvement in metabolic function. Ghrelin has been shown to be involved in numerous higher brain functions, such as memory, reward, mood, and sleep. Some of these functions are disrupted in neurodegenerative disorders, including Parkinson's disease (PD), Alzheimer's disease (AD), and Huntington's disease (HD). This link between ghrelin and these neurodegenerative diseases is supported by numerous studies. This review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the most recent evidence of the novel neuromodulatory role of ghrelin in PD, AD, and HD. Moreover, the changes in circulating and/or central ghrelin levels that are associated with disease progression are also postulated to be a biomarker for clinical diagnosis and therapy.",26809582,,10.1007/s12035-016-9729-1,28
Lipids as Emerging Biomarkers in Neurodegenerative Diseases,"Biomarkers are molecules that can be used to observe changes in an individual's biochemical or medical status and provide information to aid diagnosis or treatment decisions. Dysregulation in lipid metabolism in the brain is a major risk factor for many neurodegenerative disorders, including frontotemporal dementia, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Thus, there is a growing interest in using lipids as biomarkers in neurodegenerative diseases, with the anionic phospholipid bis(monoacylglycerol)phosphate and (glyco-)sphingolipids being the most promising lipid classes thus far. In this review, we provide a general overview of lipid biology, provide examples of abnormal lysosomal lipid metabolism in neurodegenerative diseases, and discuss how these insights might offer novel and promising opportunities in biomarker development and therapeutic discovery. Finally, we discuss the challenges and opportunities of lipid biomarkers and biomarker panels in diagnosis, prognosis, and/or treatment response in the clinic.",38203300,PMC10778656,10.3390/ijms25010131,0
Fibrin-Targeting Immunotherapy for Dementia,"Blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption is an early event in the development of Alzheimer's disease. It precedes extracellular deposition of amyloid-β in senile plaques and blood vessel walls, the intracellular accumulation of neurofibrillary tangles containing phosphorylated tau protein, microglial activation, and neuronal cell death. BBB disruption allows the coagulation protein fibrinogen to leak from the blood into the brain, where it is converted by thrombin cleavage into fibrin and deposits in the parenchyma and CNS vessels. Fibrinogen cleavage by thrombin exposes a cryptic epitope termed P2 which can bind CD11b and CD11c on microglia, macrophages and dendritic cells and trigger an inflammatory response toxic to neurons. Indeed, genetic and pharmacological evidence demonstrates a causal role for fibrin in innate immune cell activation and the development of neurodegenerative diseases. The P2 inflammatory epitope is spatially and compositionally distinct from the coagulation epitope on fibrin. Mouse monoclonal antibody 5B8, which targets the P2 epitope without interfering with the clotting process, has been shown to reduce neurodegeneration and neuroinflammation in animal models of Alzheimer's disease and multiple sclerosis. The selectivity and efficacy of this anti-human fibrin-P2 antibody in animal models supports the development of a monoclonal antibody drug targeting fibrin P2 for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases. THN391 is a humanized, affinity-matured antibody which has a 100-fold greater affinity for fibrin P2 and improved development properties compared to the parental 5B8 antibody. It is currently in a Phase 1 clinical trial.",37874085,,10.14283/jpad.2023.105,1
Suspected non-Alzheimer's pathology - Is it non-Alzheimer's or non-amyloid?,"Neurodegeneration, the progressive loss of neurons, is a major process involved in dementia and age-related cognitive impairment. It can be detected clinically using currently available biomarker tests. Suspected Non-Alzheimer Pathology (SNAP) is a biomarker-based concept that encompasses a group of individuals with neurodegeneration, but no evidence of amyloid deposition (thereby distinguishing it from Alzheimer's disease (AD)). These individuals may often have a clinical diagnosis of AD, but their clinical features, genetic susceptibility and progression can differ significantly, carrying crucial implications for precise diagnostics, clinical management, and efficacy of clinical drug trials. SNAP has caused wide interest in the dementia research community, because it is still unclear whether it represents distinct pathology separate from AD, or whether in some individuals, it could represent the earliest stage of AD. This debate has raised pertinent questions about the pathways to AD, the need for biomarkers, and the sensitivity of current biomarker tests. In this review, we discuss the biomarker and imaging trials that first recognized SNAP. We describe the pathological correlates of SNAP and comment on the different causes of neurodegeneration. Finally, we discuss the debate around the concept of SNAP, and further unanswered questions that are emerging.",28235659,,10.1016/j.arr.2017.02.003,17
Progress regarding the context-of-use of tau as biomarker of Alzheimer's disease and other neurodegenerative diseases,"Introduction: Tau protein misfolding and accumulation in toxic species is a critical pathophysiological process of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other neurodegenerative disorders (NDDs). Tau biomarkers, namely cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) total-tau (t-tau), 181-phosphorylated tau (p-tau), and tau-PET tracers, have been recently embedded in the diagnostic criteria for AD. Nevertheless, the role of tau as a diagnostic and prognostic biomarker for other NDDs remains controversial.Areas covered: We performed a systematical PubMed-based review of the most recent advances in tau-related biomarkers for NDDs. We focused on papers published from 2015 to 2020 assessing the diagnostic or prognostic value of each biomarker.Expert opinion: The assessment of tau biomarkers in alternative easily accessible matrices, through the development of ultrasensitive techniques, represents the most significant perspective for AD-biomarker research. In NDDs, novel tau isoforms (e.g. p-tau217) or proteolytic fragments (e.g. N-terminal fragments) may represent candidate diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers and may help monitoring disease progression. Protein misfolding amplification assays, allowing the identification of different tau strains (e.g. 3 R-vs. 4 R-tau) in CSF, may constitute a breakthrough for the in vivo stratification of NDDs. Tau-PET may help tracking the spatial-temporal evolution of tau pathophysiology in AD but its application outside the AD-spectrum deserves further studies.",33545008,,10.1080/14789450.2021.1886929,3
Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis: Is there a role for folate?,"Epigenetic modifications, including changes in DNA methylation, have been implicated in a wide range of diseases including neurological diseases such as Alzheimer's. The role of dietary folate in providing methyl groups required for maintenance and modulation of DNA methylation makes it a nutrient of interest in Alzheimer's. Late onset Alzheimer's disease is the most common form of dementia and at present its aetiology is largely undetermined. From epidemiological studies, the interactions between folate, B-vitamins and homocysteine as well as the long latency period has led to difficulties in interpretation of the data, thus current evidence exploring the role of dietary folate in Alzheimer's is contradictory and unresolved. Therefore, examining the effects at a molecular level and exploring potential epigenetic mechanisms could increase our understanding of the disease and aetiology. The aim of this review is to examine the role that folate could play in Alzheimer's disease neuropathology and will focus on the effects of folate on DNA methylation which link to disease pathology, initiation and progression.",29037490,,10.1016/j.mad.2017.10.001,25
Epigenetic Peripheral Biomarkers for Early Diagnosis of Alzheimer's Disease,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder and represents the leading cause of cognitive impairment and dementia in older individuals throughout the world. The main hallmarks of AD include brain atrophy, extracellular deposition of insoluble amyloid-β (Aβ) plaques, and the intracellular aggregation of protein tau in neurofibrillary tangles. These pathological modifications start many years prior to clinical manifestations of disease and thespectrumof AD progresses along acontinuumfrom preclinical to clinical phases. Therefore, identifying specific biomarkers for detecting AD at early stages greatly improves clinical management. However, stable and non-invasive biomarkers are not currently available for the early detection of the disease. In the search for more reliable biomarkers, epigenetic mechanisms, able to mediate the interaction between the genome and the environment, are emerging as important players in AD pathogenesis. Herein, we discuss altered epigenetic signatures in blood as potential peripheral biomarkers for the early detection of AD in order to help diagnosis and improve therapy.",35893045,PMC9332601,10.3390/genes13081308,8
Biomarkers for Managing Neurodegenerative Diseases,"Neurological disorders are the leading cause of cognitive and physical disability worldwide, affecting 15% of the global population. Due to the demographics of aging, the prevalence of neurological disorders, including neurodegenerative diseases, will double over the next two decades. Unfortunately, while available therapies provide symptomatic relief for cognitive and motor impairment, there is an urgent unmet need to develop disease-modifying therapies that slow the rate of pathological progression. In that context, biomarkers could identify at-risk and prodromal patients, monitor disease progression, track responses to therapy, and parse the causality of molecular events to identify novel targets for further clinical investigation. Thus, identifying biomarkers that discriminate between diseases and reflect specific stages of pathology would catalyze the discovery and development of therapeutic targets. This review will describe the prevalence, known mechanisms, ongoing or recently concluded therapeutic clinical trials, and biomarkers of three of the most prevalent neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and Parkinson's disease (PD).",38672416,PMC11048498,10.3390/biom14040398,0
Peripheral Biomarkers for Early Detection of Alzheimer's and Parkinson's Diseases,"Neurological disorders are found to be influencing the peripheral tissues outside CNS. Recent developments in biomarkers for CNS have emerged with various diagnostic and therapeutic shortcomings. The role of central biomarkers including CSF-based and molecular imaging-based probes are still unclear for early diagnosis of major neurological diseases. Current trends show that early detection of neurodegenerative diseases with non-invasive methods is a major focus of researchers, and the development of biomarkers aiming peripheral tissues is in demand. Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases are known for the progressive loss in neural structures or functions, including the neural death. Various dysfunctions of metabolic and biochemical pathways are associated with early occurrence of neuro-disorders in peripheral tissues including skin, blood cells, and eyes. This article reviews the peripheral biomarkers explored for early detection of Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases including blood cells, skin fibroblast, proteomics, saliva, olfactory, stomach and colon, heart and peripheral nervous system, and others.

Mitochondrially-Targeted Therapeutic Strategies for Alzheimer's Disease,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an irreversible, progressive neurodegenerative disease and the most common cause of dementia among older adults. There are no effective treatments available for the disease, and it is associated with great societal concern because of the substantial costs of providing care to its sufferers, whose numbers will increase as populations age. While multiple causes have been proposed to be significant contributors to the onset of sporadic AD, increased age is a unifying risk factor. In addition to amyloid-β (Aβ) and tau protein playing a key role in the initiation and progression of AD, impaired mitochondrial bioenergetics and dynamics are likely major etiological factors in AD pathogenesis and have many potential origins, including Aβ and tau. Mitochondrial dysfunction is evident in the central nervous system (CNS) and systemically early in the disease process. Addressing these multiple mitochondrial deficiencies is a major challenge of mitochondrial systems biology. We review evidence for mitochondrial impairments ranging from mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutations to epigenetic modification of mtDNA, altered gene expression, impaired mitobiogenesis, oxidative stress, altered protein turnover and changed organelle dynamics (fission and fusion). We also discuss therapeutic approaches, including repurposed drugs, epigenetic modifiers, and lifestyle changes that target each level of deficiency which could potentially alter the course of this progressive, heterogeneous Disease while being cognizant that successful future therapeutics may require a combinatorial approach.",34879805,PMC9178515,10.2174/1567205018666211208125855,6
Applications of Nanoparticles in Alzheimer's Disease,"With the rapid aging of the global population, the prevalence of neurodegenerative diseases has become a significant concern, with Alzheimer's disease (AD) being the most common. However, the clinical trials of many drugs targeting AD have failed due to the challenges posed by the blood-brain barrier (BBB), which makes intracerebral administration of drugs difficult. However, nanoparticles (NPs) may aid in the delivery of such drugs. NPs are materials with sizes between 1-100 nm that offer several advantages, such as improving biocompatibility, prolonging half-life, transporting large molecules, crossing the BBB to deliver to the central nervous system, and exhibiting good targeting ability. In addition to drug delivery, NPs also have excellent diagnostic potential, and multifunctional NPs can integrate the advantages of diagnosis, targeting, and treatment. This mini-review article provides an overview of NPs, including the composition of the carrier, strategies for crossing the BBB, and different targets of AD pathology, with the aim of providing guidance for the development prospects of NPs.",37807779,,10.3233/JAD-230098,0
Novel Approaches for the Treatment of Alzheimer's and Parkinson's Disease,"Neurodegenerative disorders affect around one billion people worldwide. They can arise from a combination of genomic, epigenomic, metabolic, and environmental factors. Aging is the leading risk factor for most chronic illnesses of old age, including Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. A progressive neurodegenerative process and neuroinflammation occur, and no current therapies can prevent, slow, or halt disease progression. To date, no novel disease-modifying therapies have been shown to provide significant benefit for patients who suffer from these devastating disorders. Therefore, early diagnosis and the discovery of new targets and novel therapies are of upmost importance. Neurodegenerative diseases, like in other age-related disorders, the progression of pathology begins many years before the onset of symptoms. Many efforts in this field have led to the conclusion that exits some similar events among these diseases that can explain why the aging brain is so vulnerable to suffer neurodegenerative diseases. This article reviews the current knowledge about these diseases by summarizing the most common features of major neurodegenerative disorders, their causes and consequences, and the proposed novel therapeutic approaches.",30743990,PMC6386829,10.3390/ijms20030719,67
Current Concepts of Neurodegenerative Mechanisms in Alzheimer's Disease,"Neurodegenerative diseases are hereditary or sporadic conditions that result in the progressive loss of the structure and function of neurons as well as neuronal death. Although a range of diseases lie under this umbrella term, Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD) are the most common neurodegenerative diseases that affect a large population around the globe. Alzheimer's disease is characterized by the abnormal accumulation of extracellular amyloid-βplaques and intraneuronal neurofibrillary tangles in brain regions and manifests as a type of dementia in aged individuals that results in memory loss, multiple cognitive abnormalities, and intellectual disabilities that interfere with quality of life. Since the discovery of AD, a wealth of new information has emerged that delineates the causes, mechanisms of disease, and potential therapeutic agents, but an effective remedy to cure the diseases has not been identified yet. This could be because of the complexity of the disease process, as it involves various contributing factors that include environmental factors and genetic predispositions. This review summarizes the current understanding on neurodegenerative mechanisms that lead to the emergence of the pathology of AD.",29707568,PMC5863339,10.1155/2018/3740461,63
Review: Somatic mutations in neurodegeneration,"Somatic mutations are postzygotic mutations which may lead to mosaicism, the presence of cells with genetic differences in an organism. Their role in cancer is well established, but detailed investigation in health and other diseases has only been recently possible. This has been empowered by the improvements of sequencing techniques, including single-cell sequencing, which can still be error-prone but is rapidly improving. Mosaicism appears relatively common in the human body, including the normal brain, probably arising in early development, but also potentially during ageing. In this review, we first discuss theoretical considerations and current evidence relevant to somatic mutations in the brain. We present a framework to explain how they may be integrated with current views on neurodegeneration, focusing mainly on sporadic late-onset neurodegenerative diseases (Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis). We review the relevant studies so far, with the first evidence emerging in Alzheimer's in particular. We also discuss the role of mosaicism in inherited neurodegenerative disorders, particularly somatic instability of tandem repeats. We summarize existing views and data to present a model whereby the time of origin and spatial distribution of relevant somatic mutations, combined with any additional risk factors, may partly determine the development and onset age of sporadic neurodegenerative diseases.",29369391,,10.1111/nan.12465,38
The contribution of DNA methylation to the (dys)function of oligodendroglia in neurodegeneration,"Neurodegenerative diseases encompass a heterogeneous group of conditions characterised by the progressive degeneration of the structure and function of the central or peripheral nervous systems. The pathogenic mechanisms underlying these diseases are not fully understood. However, a central feature consists of regional aggregation of proteins in the brain, such as the accumulation of β-amyloid plaques in Alzheimer's disease (AD), inclusions of hyperphosphorylated microtubule-binding tau in AD and other tauopathies, or inclusions containing α-synuclein in Parkinson's disease (PD), dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) and multiple system atrophy (MSA). Various pathogenic mechanisms are thought to contribute to disease, and an increasing number of studies implicate dysfunction of oligodendrocytes (the myelin producing cells of the central nervous system) and myelin loss. Aberrant DNA methylation, the most widely studied epigenetic modification, has been associated with many neurodegenerative diseases, including AD, PD, DLB and MSA, and recent findings highlight aberrant DNA methylation in oligodendrocyte/myelin-related genes. Here we briefly review the evidence showing that changes to oligodendrocytes and myelin are key in neurodegeneration, and explore the relevance of DNA methylation in oligodendrocyte (dys)function. As DNA methylation is reversible, elucidating its involvement in pathogenic mechanisms of neurodegenerative diseases and in dysfunction of specific cell-types such as oligodendrocytes may bring opportunities for therapeutic interventions for these diseases.",37386505,PMC10311741,10.1186/s40478-023-01607-9,2
Glutathione transferases and neurodegenerative diseases,"There is substantial agreement that the unbalance between oxidant and antioxidant species may affect the onset and/or the course of a number of common diseases including Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases. Many studies suggest a crucial role for oxidative stress in the first phase of aging, or in the pathogenesis of various diseases including neurological ones. Particularly, the role exerted by glutathione and glutathione-related enzymes (Glutathione Transferases) in the nervous system appears more relevant, this latter tissue being much more vulnerable to toxins and oxidative stress than other tissues such as liver, kidney or muscle. The present review addresses the question by focusing on the results obtained by specimens from patients or by in vitro studies using cells or animal models related to Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases. In general, there is an association between glutathione depletion and Parkinson's or Alzheimer's disease. In addition, a significant decrease of glutathione transferase activity in selected areas of brain and in ventricular cerebrospinal fluid was found. For some glutathione transferase genes there is also a correlation between polymorphisms and onset/outcome of neurodegenerative diseases. Thus, there is a general agreement about the protective effect exerted by glutathione and glutathione transferases but no clear answer about the mechanisms underlying this crucial role in the insurgence of neurodegenerative diseases.",25661512,,10.1016/j.neuint.2015.01.008,46
The role of microRNA-485 in neurodegenerative diseases,"Neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs) are age-related disorders characterized by progressive neurodegeneration and neuronal cell loss in the central nervous system. Neuropathological conditions such as the accumulation of misfolded proteins can cause neuroinflammation, apoptosis, and synaptic dysfunction in the brain, leading to the development of NDDs including Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD). MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small noncoding RNA molecules that regulate gene expression post-transcriptionally via RNA interference. Recently, some studies have reported that some miRNAs play an important role in the development of NDDs by regulating target gene expression. MiRNA-485 (miR-485) is a highly conserved brain-enriched miRNA. Accumulating clinical reports suggest that dysregulated miR-485 may be involved in the pathogenesis of AD and PD. Emerging studies have also shown that miR-485 plays a novel role in the regulation of neuroinflammation, apoptosis, and synaptic function in the pathogenesis of NDDs. In this review, we introduce the biological characteristics of miR-485, provide clinical evidence of the dysregulated miR-485 in NDDs, novel roles of miR-485 in neuropathological events, and discuss the potential of targeting miR-485 as a diagnostic and therapeutic marker for NDDs.",35793556,,10.1515/revneuro-2022-0039,4
Role of epigenetics in Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis,"Advances in molecular biology technologies have allowed uncovering the role of epigenetic regulation in several complex diseases, such as cancer and neurodegenerative disorders. Although the role of epigenetic mechanisms in Alzheimer's disease is still little understood, recent findings clearly show that such mechanisms are dysregulated during disease progression, already in its early stages. However, it is not clear if the observed epigenetic changes represent a cause or a consequence of the disease. Promising results are emerging from studies performed in peripheral blood DNA that could provide early biomarkers of the pathology. Moreover, given the dynamic nature of the epigenetic marks, intense research is carried out to investigate the therapeutic efficacy of compounds exerting epigenetic properties.",29888987,,10.2217/nmt-2018-0004,35
Cell models for Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease: At the interface of biology and drug discovery,"Neurodegenerative diseases are severely debilitating conditions characterized primarily by progressive neuronal loss and impairment of the nervous system. Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases are the most common neurodegenerative disorders, and their impact is increasing as average life expectancy increases worldwide. Although the underlying mechanisms of both progressive diseases have been extensively studied, we still lack a comprehensive understanding of the molecular basis of both diseases. Current therapeutic options do not slow the progression of the diseases and only provide symptom relief. Cell models that resemble the characteristics of the disease in question are important in drug discovery projects because they provide information about the therapeutic benefits of drugs under development. Here, we review current in vitro cell models used to study the molecular basis of Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease focusing on their potential for discovering of disease-modifying therapeutics to combat neurodegenerative diseases. We discuss phenotypic screening as an important approach for identifying novel therapeutic molecules. Advances in the development of cell-based assays for drug discovery are discussed, ranging from simple monoculture cell models to high-throughput three-dimensional cell models. Finally, we critically present the limitations of cell models and the caveats encountered in drug discovery to find effective treatment for neurodegenerative diseases.",36068783,,10.1016/j.biopha.2022.112924,12
The pathogenic effects of particulate matter on neurodegeneration: a review,"The increasing amount of particulate matter (PM) in the ambient air is a pressing public health issue globally. Epidemiological studies involving data from millions of patients or volunteers have associated PM with increased risk of dementia and Alzheimer's disease in the elderly and cognitive dysfunction and neurodegenerative pathology across all age groups, suggesting that PM may be a risk factor for neurodegenerative diseases. Neurodegenerative diseases affect an increasing population in this aging society, putting a heavy burden on economics and family. Therefore, understanding the mechanism by which PM contributes to neurodegeneration is essential to develop effective interventions. Evidence in human and animal studies suggested that PM induced neurodenegerative-like pathology including neurotoxicity, neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, and damage in blood-brain barrier and neurovascular units, which may contribute to the increased risk of neurodegeneration. Interestingly, antagonizing oxidative stress alleviated the neurotoxicity of PM, which may underlie the essential role of oxidative stress in PM's potential effect in neurodegeneration. This review summarized up-to-date epidemiological and experimental studies on the pathogenic role of PM in neurodegenerative diseases and discussed the possible underlying mechanisms.",35189880,PMC8862284,10.1186/s12929-022-00799-x,11
miRNAs Identify Shared Pathways in Alzheimer's and Parkinson's Diseases,"Despite the identification of several dozens of common genetic variants associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD), most of the genetic risk remains uncharacterised. Therefore, it is important to understand the role of regulatory elements, such as miRNAs. Dysregulated miRNAs are implicated in AD and PD, with potential value in dissecting the shared pathophysiology between the two disorders. miRNAs relevant to both neurodegenerative diseases are related to axonal guidance, apoptosis, and inflammation, therefore, AD and PD likely arise from similar underlying biological pathway defects. Furthermore, pathways regulated by APP, L1CAM, and genes of the caspase family may represent promising therapeutic miRNA targets in AD and PD since they are targeted by dysregulated miRNAs in both disorders.",31221572,,10.1016/j.molmed.2019.05.006,20
ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE AND ITS RELATIONSHIP WITH THE MICROBIOTA-GUT-BRAIN AXIS,"Background:Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive and irreversible neurodegenerative disease, characterized by the accumulation of amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles in the brain. Several pathways enable bidirectional communication between the central nervous system (CNS), the intestine and its microbiota, constituting the microbiota-gut-brain axis.Objective:Review the pathophysiology of AD, relate it to the microbiota-gut-brain axis and discuss the possibility of using probiotics in the treatment and/or prevention of this disease.Methods:Search of articles from the PubMed database published in the last 5 years (2017 to 2022) structure the narrative review.Results:The composition of the gut microbiota influences the CNS, resulting in changes in host behavior and may be related to the development of neurodegenerative diseases. Some metabolites produced by the intestinal microbiota, such as trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO), may be involved in the pathogenesis of AD, while other compounds produced by the microbiota during the fermentation of food in the intestine, such as D-glutamate and fatty acids short chain, are beneficial in cognitive function. The consumption of live microorganisms beneficial to health, known as probiotics, has been tested in laboratory animals and humans to evaluate the effect on AD.Conclusion:Although there are few clinical trials evaluating the effect of probiotic consumption in humans with AD, the results to date indicate a beneficial contribution of the use of probiotics in this disease.",37194773,,10.1590/S0004-2803.202301000-17,2
Determination of Anti-Alzheimer's Disease Activity of Selected Plant Ingredients,"Neurodegenerative diseases, among which one of the more common is Alzheimer's disease, are the one of the biggest global public health challenges facing our generation because of the increasing elderly population in most countries. With the growing burden of these diseases, it is essential to discover and develop new treatment options capable of preventing and treating them. Neurodegenerative diseases, among which one of the most common is Alzheimer's disease, are a multifactorial disease and therefore demand multiple therapeutic approaches. One of the most important therapeutic strategies is controlling the level of acetylcholine-a neurotransmitter in cholinergic synapses-by blocking the degradation of acetylcholine using acetylcholinesterase inhibitors such as tacrine, galantamine, donepezil and rivastigmine. However, these drugs can cause some adverse side effects, such as hepatotoxicity and gastrointestinal disorder. Thus, the search for new, more effective drugs is very important. In the last few years, different active constituents from plants have been tested as potential drugs in neurodegenerative disease therapy. The availability, lower price and less toxic effects of herbal medicines compared with synthetic agents make them a simple and excellent choice in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases. The empirical approach to discovering new drugs from the systematic screening of plant extracts or plant-derived compounds is still an important strategy when it comes to finding new biologically active substances. The aim of this review is to identify new, safe and effective compounds that are potential candidates for further in vivo and clinical tests from which more effective drugs for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease could be selected. We reviewed the methods used to determine anti-Alzheimer's disease activity. Here, we have discussed the relevance of plant-derived compounds with in vitro activity. Various plants and phytochemical compounds have shown different activity that could be beneficial in the treatment of Alzheimer's disorders. Most often, medicinal plants and their active components have been investigated as acetylcholinesterase and/or butyrylcholinesterase activity inhibitors, modifiers of β-amyloid processing and antioxidant agents. This study also aims to highlight species with assessed efficacy, usable plant parts and the most active plant components in order to identify species and compounds of interest for further study. Future research directions are suggested and recommendations made to expand the use of medicinal plants, their formulations and plant-derived active compounds to prevent, mitigate and treat Alzheimer's disease.",35630702,PMC9147832,10.3390/molecules27103222,16
Review of beneficial effects of resveratrol in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease,"Purpose:The prevalence of Alzheimer's Disease is rising, in part due to increase in the medium age of residents in developed countries. The aim of the study has been to determine whether resveratrol (RSV) can be effective in the prevention or treatment of Alzheimer's Disease, providing its antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and SIRT1-activating properties.Methods:A systematic review of some experimental and clinical studies has been made. The eligibility criteria have comprised: maximum 10 years passed from the study publication, geographical diversity of the studies performed, and - as much as possible - pertaining of the reviewed study results both to animal models of AD, and to humans.Results:After the final assessment of the eligibility criteria, 96 research studies have been included in the review. Overall results suggest that RSV can be effectively used in the prevention of AD, especially in reference to its familial forms with an early onset. At the same time, efficacy of RSV in the treatment of AD needs further studies, aimed at: improving its transport through the blood-brain barrier (BBB), performing prospective clinical in vivo trials on large groups of patients, and determining the optimal RSV dosage.Discussion:Providing RSV mechanisms of action, inhibitory in reference to many pathomechanisms of AD, it seems very likely that RSV could be effective in AD prevention. The main limitations referring to such presumption include: limited permeability of BBB to RSV, and scarcity of clinical studies on RSV pertaining to large groups of humans.",32871321,,10.1016/j.advms.2020.08.002,18
Genetic insights into immune mechanisms of Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease,"Microglia, the macrophages of the brain, are vital for brain homeostasis and have been implicated in a broad range of brain disorders. Neuroinflammation has gained traction as a possible therapeutic target for neurodegeneration, however, the precise function of microglia in specific neurodegenerative disorders is an ongoing area of research. Genetic studies offer valuable insights into understanding causality, rather than merely observing a correlation. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified many genetic loci that are linked to susceptibility to neurodegenerative disorders. (Post)-GWAS studies have determined that microglia likely play an important role in the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD). The process of understanding how individual GWAS risk loci affect microglia function and mediate susceptibility is complex. A rapidly growing number of publications with genomic datasets and computational tools have formulated new hypotheses that guide the biological interpretation of AD and PD genetic risk. In this review, we discuss the key concepts and challenges in the post-GWAS interpretation of AD and PD GWAS risk alleles. Post-GWAS challenges include the identification of target cell (sub)type(s), causal variants, and target genes. Crucially, the prediction of GWAS-identified disease-risk cell types, variants and genes require validation and functional testing to understand the biological consequences within the pathology of the disorders. Many AD and PD risk genes are highly pleiotropic and perform multiple important functions that might not be equally relevant for the mechanisms by which GWAS risk alleles exert their effect(s). Ultimately, many GWAS risk alleles exert their effect by changing microglia function, thereby altering the pathophysiology of these disorders, and hence, we believe that modelling this context is crucial for a deepened understanding of these disorders.",37359515,PMC10285485,10.3389/fimmu.2023.1168539,3
Relevance of biomarkers across different neurodegenerative diseases,"Background:The panel of fluid- and imaging-based biomarkers available for neurodegenerative disease research is growing and has the potential to close important gaps in research and the clinic. With this growth and increasing use, appropriate implementation and interpretation are paramount. Various biomarkers feature nuanced differences in strengths, limitations, and biases that must be considered when investigating disease etiology and clinical utility. For example, neuropathological investigations of Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis can fall in disagreement with conclusions reached by biomarker-based investigations. Considering the varied strengths, limitations, and biases of different research methodologies and approaches may help harmonize disciplines within the neurodegenerative disease field.Purpose of review:Along with separate review articles covering fluid and imaging biomarkers in this issue of Alzheimer's Research and Therapy, we present the result of a discussion from the 2019 Biomarkers in Neurodegenerative Diseases course at the University College London. Here, we discuss themes of biomarker use in neurodegenerative disease research, commenting on appropriate use, interpretation, and considerations for implementation across different neurodegenerative diseases. We also draw attention to areas where biomarker use can be combined with other disciplines to understand issues of pathophysiology and etiology underlying dementia. Lastly, we highlight novel modalities that have been proposed in the landscape of neurodegenerative disease research and care.",32404143,PMC7222479,10.1186/s13195-020-00601-w,33
Synaptic Effects of Palmitoylethanolamide in Neurodegenerative Disorders,"Increasing evidence strongly supports the key role of neuroinflammation in the pathophysiology of neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease, frontotemporal dementia, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Neuroinflammation may alter synaptic transmission contributing to the progression of neurodegeneration, as largely documented in animal models and in patients' studies. In the last few years, palmitoylethanolamide (PEA), an endogenous lipid mediator, and its new composite, which is a formulation constituted of PEA and the well-recognized antioxidant flavonoid luteolin (Lut) subjected to an ultra-micronization process (co-ultraPEALut), has been identified as a potential therapeutic agent in different disorders by exerting potential beneficial effects on neurodegeneration and neuroinflammation by modulating synaptic transmission. In this review, we will show the potential therapeutic effects of PEA in animal models and in patients affected by neurodegenerative disorders.",36009055,PMC9405819,10.3390/biom12081161,8
Functional Connectivity in Neurodegenerative Disorders: Alzheimer's Disease and Frontotemporal Dementia,"Neurodegenerative disorders are a growing cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Onset is typically insidious and clinical symptoms of behavioral change, memory loss, or cognitive dysfunction may not be evident early in the disease process. Efforts have been made to discover biomarkers that allow for earlier diagnosis of neurodegenerative disorders, to initiate treatment that may slow the course of clinical deterioration. Neuronal dysfunction occurs earlier than clinical symptoms manifest. Thus, assessment of neuronal function using functional brain imaging has been examined as a potential biomarker. While most early studies used task-functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), with the more recent technique of resting-state fMRI, ""intrinsic"" relationships between brain regions or brain networks have been studied in greater detail in neurodegenerative disorders. In Alzheimer's disease, the most common neurodegenerative disorder, and frontotemporal dementia, another of the common dementias, specific brain networks may be particularly susceptible to dysfunction. In this review, we highlight the major findings of functional connectivity assessed by resting state fMRI in Alzheimer's disease and frontotemporal dementia.",31794504,,10.1097/RMR.0000000000000223,17
Engrampigenetics: Epigenetics of engram memory cells,"For long time, the epidemiology of late-onset sporadic Alzheimer's disease (AD) risk factors has centered on adult life-style. Recent studies have, instead, focused on the role of early life experiences in progression of such disease especially in the context of prenatal and postnatal life. Although no single unfavorable environmental event has been shown to be neither necessary nor sufficient for AD development, it is possible that the sum of several environmentally induced effects, over time, contribute to its pathophysiology through epigenetic mechanisms. Indeed, epigenetic changes are influenced by environmental factors and have been proposed to play a role in multifactorial pathologies such as AD. At the same time, recent findings suggest that epigenetic mechanisms are one method that neurons use to translate transient stimuli into stable memories. Thus, the characteristics of epigenetics being a critical link between the environment and genes and playing a crucial role in memory formation make candidate epigenetic mechanisms a natural substrate for AD research. Indeed, independent groups have reported several epigenetically dysregulated genes in AD models; however, the role of epigenetic mechanisms in AD has remained elusive owing to contradictory results. Here, I propose that restricting the analysis of epigenetic changes specifically to subpopulations of neurons (namely, engram memory cells) might be helpful in understanding the role of the epigenetic process in the memory-related specific epigenetic code and might constitute a new template for therapeutic interventions against AD.",27899292,,10.1016/j.bbr.2016.11.043,4
Microglial phagocytosis in aging and Alzheimer's disease,"Microglia are the innate immune cells of the brain, which maintain homeostasis by constantly scanning and surveying the environment with their highly ramified processes. In order to exert this function, they need to phagocytose synapses as well as debris and dead cells, a process that is further amplified in pathological conditions. Importantly, it has been shown that microglia phagocytic capacity is altered in the course of neurodegenerative disease, for which aging is one of the highest risk factors. Thus, understanding how phagocytosis is impaired during aging is a priority for future research. Advances in this area are expected to significantly contribute to our understanding of normal cognition during aging, as well as changes that take place in age-associated neurodegenerative diseases. In this review, we will summarize the current knowledge on how phagocytosis is executed and affected by aging or in age-associated neurological disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). Furthermore, we will summarize both protective and deleterious consequences of altered phagocytosis in AD and where relevant in other neurodegenerative diseases.",30942936,,10.1002/jnr.24419,57
Alzheimer's disease as an inflammatory disease,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative condition characterized by the formation of amyloid-β plaques, aggregated and hyperphosphorylated tau protein, activated microglia and neuronal cell death, ultimately leading to progressive dementia. In this short review, we focus on neuroinflammation in AD. Specifically, we describe the participation of microglia, as well as other factors that may contribute to inflammation, in neurodegeneration.",28231054,,10.1515/bmc-2016-0029,94
Resveratrol: A Focus on Several Neurodegenerative Diseases,"Molecules of the plant world are proving their effectiveness in countering, slowing down, and regressing many diseases. The resveratrol for its intrinsic properties related to its stilbene structure has been proven to be a universal panacea, especially for a wide range of neurodegenerative diseases. This paper evaluates (in vivo and in vitro) the various molecular targets of this peculiar polyphenol and its ability to effectively counter several neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, and Huntington's diseases and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. What emerges is that, in the deep heterogeneity of the pathologies evaluated, resveratrol through a convergence on the protein targets is able to give therapeutic responses in neuronal cells deeply diversified not only in morphological structure but especially in their function performed in the anatomical district to which they belong.",26180587,PMC4477222,10.1155/2015/392169,67
Ceramide/Sphingosine 1-Phosphate Axis as a Key Target for Diagnosis and Treatment in Alzheimer's Disease and Other Neurodegenerative Diseases,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is considered the most prevalent neurodegenerative disease and the leading cause of dementia worldwide. Sphingolipids, such as ceramide or sphingosine 1-phosphate, are bioactive molecules implicated in structural and signaling functions. Metabolic dysfunction in the highly conserved pathways to produce sphingolipids may lead to or be a consequence of an underlying disease. Recent studies on transcriptomics and sphingolipidomics have observed alterations in sphingolipid metabolism of both enzymes and metabolites involved in their synthesis in several neurodegenerative diseases, including AD. In this review, we highlight the most relevant findings related to ceramide and neurodegeneration, with a special focus on AD.",35897658,PMC9331765,10.3390/ijms23158082,7
Natural Products as the Potential to Improve Alzheimer's and Parkinson's Disease,"Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease are the two most common neurodegenerative diseases in the world, and their incidence rates are increasing as our society ages. This creates a significant social and economic burden. Although the exact cause and treatment methods for these diseases are not yet known, research suggests that Alzheimer's disease is caused by amyloid precursor protein, while α-synuclein acts as a causative agent in Parkinson's disease. The accumulation of abnormal proteins such as these can lead to symptoms such as loss of protein homeostasis, mitochondrial dysfunction, and neuroinflammation, which ultimately result in the death of nerve cells and the progression of neurodegenerative diseases. The medications currently available for these diseases only delay their progression and have many adverse effects, which has led to increased interest in developing natural products with fewer adverse effects. In this study, we selected specific keywords and thesis content to investigate natural products that are effective in treating Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. We reviewed 16 papers on natural products and found that they showed promising mechanisms of action such as antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and mitochondrial function improvement. Other natural products with similar properties could also be considered potential treatments for neurodegenerative diseases, and they can be consumed as part of a healthy diet rather than as medicine.",37240173,PMC10218422,10.3390/ijms24108827,2
Epigenetics in Alzheimer's Disease: Perspective of DNA Methylation,"Research over the years has shown that causes of Alzheimer's disease are not well understood, but over the past years, the involvement of epigenetic mechanisms in the developing memory formation either under pathological or physiological conditions has become clear. The term epigenetics represents the heredity of changes in phenotype that are independent of altered DNA sequences. Different studies validated that cytosine methylation of genomic DNA decreases with age in different tissues of mammals, and therefore, the role of epigenetic factors in developing neurological disorders in aging has been under focus. In this review, we summarized and reviewed the involvement of different epigenetic mechanisms especially the DNA methylation in Alzheimer's disease (AD), late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD), familial Alzheimer's disease (FAD), and autosomal dominant Alzheimer's disease (ADAD). Down to the minutest of details, we tried to discuss the methylation patterns like mitochondrial DNA methylation and ribosomal DNA (rDNA) methylation. Additionally, we mentioned some therapeutic approaches related to epigenetics, which could provide a potential cure for AD. Moreover, we reviewed some recent studies that validate DNA methylation as a potential biomarker and its role in AD. We hope that this review will provide new insights into the understanding of AD pathogenesis from the epigenetic perspective especially from the perspective of DNA methylation.",28092081,,10.1007/s12035-016-0357-6,58
Harnessing Immunoproteostasis to Treat Neurodegenerative Disorders,"Immunoproteostasis is a term used to reflect interactions between the immune system and the proteinopathies that are presumptive ""triggers"" of many neurodegenerative disorders. The study of immunoproteostasis is bolstered by several observations. Mutations or rare variants in genes expressed in microglial cells, known to regulate immune functions, or both can cause, or alter risk for, various neurodegenerative disorders. Additionally, genetic association studies identify numerous loci harboring genes that encode proteins of known immune function that alter risk of developing Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other neurodegenerative proteinopathies. Further, preclinical studies reveal beneficial effects and liabilities of manipulating immune pathways in various neurodegenerative disease models. Although there are concerns that manipulation of the immune system may cause more harm than good, there is considerable interest in developing immune modulatory therapies for neurodegenerative disorders. Herein, I highlight the promise and challenges of harnessing immunoproteostasis to treat neurodegenerative proteinopathies.",30897353,PMC6594693,10.1016/j.neuron.2019.02.027,19
Biological Basis for Amyloidogenesis in Alzheimer's Disease,"Certain cellular proteins normally soluble in the living organism under certain conditions form aggregates with a specific cross-β sheet structure called amyloid. These intra- or extracellular insoluble aggregates (fibers or plaques) are hallmarks of many neurodegenerative pathologies including Alzheimer's disease (AD), Huntington's disease, Parkinson's disease, prion disease, and other progressive neurological diseases that develop in the aging human central nervous system. Amyloid diseases (amyloidoses) are widespread in the elderly human population, a rapidly expanding demographic in many global populations. Increasing age is the most significant risk factor for neurodegenerative diseases associated with amyloid plaques. To date, nearly three dozen different misfolded proteins targeting brain and other organs have been identified in amyloid diseases and AD, the most prevalent neurodegenerative amyloid disease affecting over 15 million people worldwide. Here we (i) highlight the latest data on mechanisms of amyloid formation and further discuss a hypothesis on the amyloid cascade as a primary mechanism of AD pathogenesis and (ii) review the evolutionary aspects of amyloidosis, which allow new insight on human-specific mechanisms of dementia development.",28320296,,10.1134/S0006297917020043,14
Applications of CRISPR-Cas9 in Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders,"Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and Huntington's disease represent some of the most prevalent neurodegenerative disorders afflicting millions of people worldwide. Unfortunately, there is a lack of efficacious treatments to cure or stop the progression of these disorders. While the causes of such a lack of therapies can be attributed to various reasons, the disappointing results of recent clinical trials suggest the need for novel and innovative approaches. Since its discovery, there has been a growing excitement around the potential for CRISPR-Cas9 mediated gene editing to identify novel mechanistic insights into disease pathogenesis and to mediate accurate gene therapy. To this end, the literature is rich with experiments aimed at generating novel models of these disorders and offering proof-of-concept studies in preclinical animal models validating the great potential and versatility of this gene-editing system. In this review, we provide an overview of how the CRISPR-Cas9 systems have been used in these neurodegenerative disorders.",35955847,PMC9368966,10.3390/ijms23158714,9
Targeting epigenetics: A novel promise for Alzheimer's disease treatment,"So far, the search for a cure for Alzheimer Disease (AD) has been unsuccessful. The only approved drugs attenuate some symptoms, but do not halt the progress of this disease, which affects 50 million people worldwide and will increase its incidence in the coming decades. Such scenario demands new therapeutic approaches to fight against this devastating dementia. In recent years, multi-omics research and the analysis of differential epigenetic marks in AD subjects have contributed to our understanding of AD; however, the impact of epigenetic research is yet to be seen. This review integrates the most recent data on pathological processes and epigenetic changes relevant for aging and AD, as well as current therapies targeting epigenetic machinery in clinical trials. Evidence shows that epigenetic modifications play a key role in gene expression, which could provide multi-target preventative and therapeutic approaches in AD. Both novel and repurposed drugs are employed in AD clinical trials due to their epigenetic effects, as well as increasing number of natural compounds. Given the reversible nature of epigenetic modifications and the complexity of gene-environment interactions, the combination of epigenetic-based therapies with environmental strategies and drugs with multiple targets might be needed to properly help AD patients.",37422087,,10.1016/j.arr.2023.102003,4
Common therapeutic strategies for prion and Alzheimer's diseases,"A number of unexpected pathophysiological connections linking different neurodegenerative diseases have emerged over the past decade. An example is provided by prion and Alzheimer's diseases. Despite being distinct pathologies, these disorders share several neurotoxic mechanisms, including accumulation of misfolded protein isoforms, stress of the protein synthesis machinery, and activation of a neurotoxic signaling mediated by the cellular prion protein. Here, in addition to reviewing these mechanisms, we will discuss the potential therapeutic interventions for prion and Alzheimer's diseases that are arising from the comprehension of their common neurodegenerative pathways.",27279060,,10.1515/hsz-2016-0190,3
Potential for Treatment of Neurodegenerative Diseases with Natural Products or Synthetic Compounds that Stabilize Microtubules,"No effective therapeutics to treat neurodegenerative diseases exist, despite significant attempts to find drugs that can reduce or rescue the debilitating symptoms of tauopathies such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, frontotemporal dementia, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or Pick's disease. A number of in vitro and in vivo models exist for studying neurodegenerative diseases, including cell models employing induced-pluripotent stem cells, cerebral organoids, and animal models of disease. Recent research has focused on microtubulestabilizing agents, either natural products or synthetic compounds that can prevent the axonal destruction caused by tau protein pathologies. Although promising results have come from animal model studies using brainpenetrant natural product microtubule-stabilizing agents, such as paclitaxel analogs that can access the brain, epothilones B and D, and other synthetic compounds such as davunetide or the triazolopyrimidines, early clinical trials in humans have been disappointing. This review aims to summarize the research that has been carried out in this area and discuss the potential for the future development of an effective microtubule stabilizing drug to treat neurodegenerative disease.",32564745,,10.2174/1381612826666200621171302,6
The role of magnetic fields in neurodegenerative diseases,"The term neurodegenerative diseases include a long list of diseases affecting the nervous system that are characterized by the degeneration of different neurological structures. Among them, Alzheimer disease (AD), Parkinson disease (PD), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) are the most representative ones. The vast majority of cases are sporadic and results from the interaction of genes and environmental factors in genetically predisposed individuals. Among environmental conditions, electromagnetic field exposure has begun to be assessed as a potential risk factor for neurodegeneration. In this review, we discuss the existing literature regarding electromagnetic fields and neurodegenerative diseases. Epidemiological studies in AD, PD, and ALS have shown discordant results; thus, a clear correlation between electromagnetic exposure and neurodegeneration has not been demonstrated. In addition, we discuss the role of electromagnetic radiation as a potential non-invasive therapeutic strategy for some neurodegenerative diseases, particularly for PD and AD.",32198562,,10.1007/s00484-020-01896-y,13
Orexins role in neurodegenerative diseases: From pathogenesis to treatment,"Orexin is a neurotransmitter that mainly regulates sleep/wake cycle. In addition to its sleep cycle regulatory role, it is involved in regulation of attention, energy homeostasis, neurogenesis and cognition. Several evidences has shown the involvement of orexin in narcolepsy, but there are also growing evidences that shows the disturbance in orexin system in neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, Epilepsy, Huntington's diseases and Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Pathogenesis and clinical symptoms of these disorders can be partly attributed from orexin system imbalance. However, there are controversial reports on the exact relationship between orexin and these neurodegenerative diseases. Therefore, the aim of this review is to summarize the current evidences regarding the role of orexin in these neurodegenerative diseases.",32315694,,10.1016/j.pbb.2020.172929,7
The Role of Cdk5 in Alzheimer's Disease,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is known as the most fatal chronic neurodegenerative disease in adults along with progressive loss of memory and other cognitive function disorders. Cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5), a unique member of the cyclin-dependent kinases (Cdks), is reported to intimately associate with the process of the pathogenesis of AD. Cdk5 is of vital importance in the development of CNS and neuron movements such as neuronal migration and differentiation, synaptic functions, and memory consolidation. However, when neurons suffer from pathological stimuli, Cdk5 activity becomes hyperactive and causes aberrant hyperphosphorylation of various substrates of Cdk5 like amyloid precursor protein (APP), tau and neurofilament, resulting in neurodegenerative diseases like AD. Deregulation of Cdk5 contributes to an array of pathological events in AD, ranging from formation of senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles, synaptic damage, mitochondrial dysfunction to cell cycle reactivation as well as neuronal cell apoptosis. More importantly, an inhibition of Cdk5 activity with inhibitors such as RNA inference (RNAi) could protect from memory decline and neuronal cell loss through suppressing β-amyloid (Aβ)-induced neurotoxicity and tauopathies. This review will briefly describe the above-mentioned possible roles of Cdk5 in the physiological and pathological mechanisms of AD, further discussing recent advances and challenges in Cdk5 as a therapeutic target.",26227906,,10.1007/s12035-015-9369-x,103
Research on ferroptosis as a therapeutic target for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases,"Ferroptosis is an iron- and lipid peroxidation (LPO)-mediated programmed cell death type. Recently, mounting evidence has indicated the involvement of ferroptosis in neurodegenerative diseases, especially in Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), multiple sclerosis (MS), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Huntington's disease (HD), and so on. Treating ferroptosis presents opportunities as well as challenges for neurodegenerative diseases. This review provides a comprehensive overview of typical features of ferroptosis and the underlying mechanisms that contribute to its occurrence, as well as their implications in the pathogenesis and advancement of major neurodegenerative disorders. Meanwhile, we summarize the utilization of ferroptosis inhibition in both experimental and clinical approaches for the treatment of major neurodegenerative disorders. In addition, we specifically summarize recent advances in developing therapeutic means targeting ferroptosis in these diseases, which may guide future approaches for the effective management of these devastating medical conditions.",37619619,,10.1016/j.arr.2023.102035,6
Biosensor approaches on the diagnosis of neurodegenerative diseases: Sensing the past to the future,"Early diagnosis of neurodegeneration-oriented diseases that develop with the aging world is essential for improving the patient's living conditions as well as the treatment of the disease. Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases are prominent examples of neurodegeneration characterized by dementia leading to the death of nerve cells. The clinical diagnosis of these diseases only after the symptoms appear, delays the treatment process. Detection of biomarkers, which are distinctive molecules in biological fluids, involved in neurodegeneration processes, has the potential to allow early diagnosis of neurodegenerative diseases. Studies on biosensors, whose main responsibility is to detect the target analyte with high specificity, has gained momentum in recent years with the aim of high detection of potential biomarkers of neurodegeneration process. This study aims to provide an overview of neuro-biosensors developed on the basis of biomarkers identified in biological fluids for the diagnosis of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), and Parkinson's disease (PD), and to provide an overview of the urgent needs in this field, emphasizing the importance of early diagnosis in the general lines of the neurodegeneration pathway. In this review, biosensor systems developed for the detection of biomarkers of neurodegenerative diseases, especially in the last 5 years, are discussed.",34861607,,10.1016/j.jpba.2021.114479,6
Loneliness as Risk Factor for Alzheimer´s disease,"There is considerable empirical evidence that unequivocally points to loneliness as a modifiable risk factor for the development of Alzheimer's disease and other related dementias. With the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting lockdown and social distancing, there has been a renewed interest in studying this topic. The present review examines the links between loneliness and Alzheimer's disease, with particular emphasis on the mechanisms common to both conditions.",35249519,,10.2174/1874609815666220304195049,2
A Review on Chitosan in Drug Delivery for Treatment of Neurological and Psychiatric Disorders,"Neurological diseases are known as global health problems with a growing number of patients annually. Neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease as well as spinal cord injury, hypoxic ischemia injury, epilepsy, depression and etc., are some examples of neurological diseases. One of the main problems in the treatment of these diseases is the delivery of drugs across the blood-brain barrier (BBB). These days, researchers have tended to find non-invasive and non-toxic strategies for solving this problem. As a non-toxic, safe, and potential agent, chitosan has attracted attention for use in drug delivery systems. Recently, numerous studies have been designed to develop drug delivery systems by using chitosan to treat various neurological diseases. In this paper, the latest developments of chitosan and its derivatives utilization in the drug delivery systems for the treatment of different neurological and psychiatric diseases were reviewed.",34161209,,10.2174/1389201022666210622111028,3
Neuroimmune interactions in Alzheimer's disease-New frontier with old challenges?,"The perceived role of the immune system in neurodegenerative diseases has undergone drastic changes over time. Initially considered as a passive bystander, then condemned as a mediator of neurodegeneration and now established as an important player in the pathogenetic cascade, neuroimmune interactions have come a long way to arrive center stage in Alzheimer's disease research. Despite major breakthroughs in recent years, basic questions remain unanswered as conflicting data describe immune overactivation, inadequate response or exhaustion of the immune system in neurodegenerative diseases. Furthermore, difficulties in translating in vitro and in vivo studies in model systems to the complex human disease condition with multiple overlapping pathologies and the long disease duration in patients suffering from neurodegenerative diseases have hampered progress. Development of novel, advanced model systems, as well as new technologies to interrogate existing disease models and valuable collections of human tissue samples, including brain tissue in parallel with improved imaging and biomarker technologies are guiding the way to better understand the role of the immune system in Alzheimer's disease with hopes for more effective interventions in the future.",31699314,PMC6939624,10.1016/bs.pmbts.2019.10.002,7
Targeted Mitochondrial Epigenetics: A New Direction in Alzheimer's Disease Treatment,"Mitochondrial epigenetic alterations are closely related to Alzheimer's disease (AD), which is described in this review. Reports of the alteration of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) methylation in AD demonstrate that the disruption of the dynamic balance of mtDNA methylation and demethylation leads to damage to the mitochondrial electron transport chain and the obstruction of mitochondrial biogenesis, which is the most studied mitochondrial epigenetic change. Mitochondrial noncoding RNA modifications and the post-translational modification of mitochondrial nucleoproteins have been observed in neurodegenerative diseases and related diseases that increase the risk of AD. Although there are still relatively few mitochondrial noncoding RNA modifications and mitochondrial nuclear protein post-translational modifications reported in AD, we have reason to believe that these mitochondrial epigenetic modifications also play an important role in the AD process. This review provides a new research direction for the AD mechanism, starting from mitochondrial epigenetics. Further, this review summarizes therapeutic approaches to targeted mitochondrial epigenetics, which is the first systematic summary of therapeutic approaches in the field, including folic acid supplementation, mitochondrial-targeting antioxidants, and targeted ubiquitin-specific proteases, providing a reference for therapeutic targets for AD.",36077101,PMC9456144,10.3390/ijms23179703,3
"Disentangling tau: One protein, many therapeutic approaches","The tauopathies encompass over 20 adult neurodegenerative diseases and are characterized by the dysfunction and accumulation of insoluble tau protein. Among them, Alzheimer's disease, frontotemporal dementia, and progressive supranuclear palsy collectively impact millions of patients and their families worldwide. Despite years of drug development using a variety of mechanisms of action, no therapeutic directed against tau has been approved for clinical use. This raises important questions about our current model of tau pathology and invites thoughtful consideration of our approach to nonclinical models and clinical trial design. In this article, we review what is known about the biology and genetics of tau, placing it in the context of current and failed clinical trials. We highlight potential reasons for the lack of success to date and offer suggestions for new pathways in therapeutic development. Overall, our viewpoint to the future is optimistic for this important group of neurodegenerative diseases.",38278659,PMC10963923,10.1016/j.neurot.2024.e00321,1
O-GlcNAcylation and Its Roles in Neurodegenerative Diseases,"As a non-classical post-translational modification, O-linked β-N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc) modification (O-GlcNAcylation) is widely found in human organ systems, particularly in our brains, and is indispensable for healthy cell biology. With the increasing age of the global population, the incidence of neurodegenerative diseases is increasing, too. The common characteristic of these disorders is the aggregation of abnormal proteins in the brain. Current research has found that O-GlcNAcylation dysregulation is involved in misfolding or aggregation of these abnormal proteins to mediate disease progression, but the specific mechanism has not been defined. This paper reviews recent studies on O-GlcNAcylation's roles in several neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Huntington's disease, Machado-Joseph's disease, and giant axonal neuropathy, and shows that O-GlcNAcylation, as glucose metabolism sensor, mediating synaptic function, participating in oxidative stress response and signaling pathway conduction, directly or indirectly regulates characteristic pathological protein toxicity and affects disease progression. The existing results suggest that targeting O-GlcNAcylation will provide new ideas for clinical diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of neurodegenerative diseases.",38250776,,10.3233/JAD-230955,0
Neurogenesis-based epigenetic therapeutics for Alzheimer's disease (Review),"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a worldwide health problem with multiple pathogenic causes including aging, and genetic and environmental factors. As the interfaces between genes and the environment, epigenetic mechanisms, including DNA methylation, histone modification and microRNAs, are also involved in the pathogenesis of AD. Neurogenesis occurs throughout life in the normal adult brain of mammals. The neurogenic process, consisting of the proliferation, differentiation and maturation of neural stem cells (NSC), is regulated via epigenetic mechanisms by controlling the expression of specific sets of genes. In the pathology of AD, due to impairments in epigenetic mechanisms, the generation of neurons from NSCs is damaged, which exacerbates the loss of neurons and the deficits in learning and memory function associated with AD. Based on neurogenesis, a number of therapeutic strategies have shown capability in promoting neuronal generation to compensate for the neurons lost in AD, thereby improving cognitive function through epigenetic modifications. This provides potential for the treatment of AD by stimulating neurogenesis using epigenetic strategies. The present review discusses the epigenetics of AD and adult neurogenesis, and summarizes the neurogenesis-based epigenetic therapies targeted at AD. Such a review may offer information for the guidance of future developments of therapeutic strategies for AD.",27314984,,10.3892/mmr.2016.5390,15
Alzheimer's Disease and Medicinal Plants: An Overview,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is progressive neurodegenerative disorder and identified as a major health concern globally. Individuals with AD and their care givers are affected in personal, emotional, financial, and social levels. Due to its significant impact and heavy burden on the individual, the patients' families, and society, it is highly needed to search for cost effective, long-time retention therapeutic targets. In recent decades, there are lots of research conducted the possible benefit of natural products and their active components on AD and other neurodegenerative disease, which are discussed here.",27651250,,10.1007/978-3-319-28383-8_6,4
Bridging the age spectrum of neurodegenerative storage diseases,"For over a century, researchers have observed similar neurodegenerative hallmarks in brains of people affected by rare early-onset lysosomal storage diseases and late-onset neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease. Increasing evidence suggests these apparently disparate diseases share a common underlying feature, namely, a dysfunctional clearance of cellular cargo through the secretory-endosomal-autophagic-lysosomal-exocytic (SEALE) network. By providing examples of rare and common neurodegenerative diseases known to have pathologically altered cargo flux through the SEALE network, we explore the unifying hypothesis that impaired catabolism or exocytosis of SEALE cargo, places a burden of stress on neurons that initiates pathogenesis. We also describe how a growing understanding of genetic, epigenetic and age-related modifications of the SEALE network, has inspired a number of novel disease-modifying therapeutic approaches aimed at alleviating SEALE storage and providing therapeutic benefit to people affected by these devastating diseases across the age spectrum.",25987168,,10.1016/j.beem.2014.08.009,11
Extracellular vesicles in the study of Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases: Methodologies applied from cells to biofluids,"Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are gaining increased importance in fundamental research as key players in disease pathogenic mechanisms, but also in translational and clinical research due to their value in biomarker discovery, either for diagnostics and/or therapeutics. In the first research scenario, the study of EVs isolated from neuronal models mimicking neurodegenerative diseases can open new avenues to better understand the pathological mechanisms underlying these conditions or to identify novel molecular targets for diagnosis and/or therapeutics. In the second research scenario, the easy availability of EVs in body fluids and the specificity of their cargo, which can reflect the cell of origin or disease profiles, turn these into attractive diagnostic tools. EVs with exosome-like characteristics, circulating in the bloodstream and other peripheral biofluids, constitute a non-invasive and rapid alternative to study several conditions, including brain-related disorders. In both cases, several EVs isolation methods are already available, but each neuronal model or biofluid presents its own challenges. Herein, a literature overview on EVs isolation methodologies from distinct neuronal models (cellular culture and brain tissue) and body fluids (serum, plasma, cerebrospinal fluid, urine and saliva) was carried out. Focus was given to approaches employed in the context of Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases, and the main research findings discussed. The topics here revised will facilitate the choice of EVs isolation methodologies and potentially prompt new discoveries in EVs research and in the neurodegenerative diseases field.",36156258,PMC9828694,10.1111/jnc.15697,5
Alzheimer's Disease Puzzle: Delving into Pathogenesis Hypotheses,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a prevalent neurodegenerative disease characterized by both amnestic and non-amnestic clinical manifestations. It accounts for approximately 60-70% of all dementia cases worldwide. With the increasing number of AD patients, elucidating underlying mechanisms and developing corresponding interventional strategies are necessary. Hypotheses about AD such as amyloid cascade, Tau hyper-phosphorylation, neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, cholinergic, and vascular hypotheses are not mutually exclusive, and all of them play a certain role in the development of AD. The amyloid cascade hypothesis is currently the most widely studied; however, other hypotheses are also gaining support. This article summarizes the recent evidence regarding major pathological hypotheses of AD and their potential interplay, as well as the strengths and weaknesses of each hypothesis and their implications for the development of effective treatments. This could stimulate further studies and promote the development of more effective therapeutic strategies for AD.",37450931,PMC10796101,10.14336/AD.2023.0608,8
Gut microbiota defined epigenomes of Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases reveal novel targets for therapy,"The origins of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD) involve genetic mutations, epigenetic changes, neurotoxin exposure and gut microbiota dysregulation. The gut microbiota's dynamic composition and its metabolites influence intestinal and blood-brain barrier integrity, contributing to AD and PD development. This review explores protein misfolding, aggregation and epigenetic links in AD and PD pathogenesis. It also highlights the role of a leaky gut and the microbiota-gut-brain axis in promoting these diseases through inflammation-induced epigenetic alterations. In addition, we investigate the potential of diet, probiotics and microbiota transplantation for preventing and treating AD and PD via epigenetic modifications, along with a discussion related to current challenges and future considerations. These approaches offer promise for translating research findings into practical clinical applications.",38088063,,10.2217/epi-2023-0342,0
Impact of the Cannabinoid System in Alzheimer's Disease,"Cannabinoids are compounds isolated from cannabis and are also widely present in both nervous and immune systems of animals. In recent years, with in-depth research on cannabinoids, their clinical medicinal value has been evaluated, and many exciting achievements have been continuously accumulating, especially in the field of neurodegenerative disease. Alzheimer's disease is the most common type of neurodegenerative disease that causes dementia and has become a global health problem that seriously impacts human health today. In this review, we discuss the therapeutic potential of cannabinoids for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. How cannabinoids act on different endocannabinoid receptor subtypes to regulate Alzheimer's disease and the roles of the endocannabinoid system in Alzheimer's disease are outlined, and the underlying mechanisms are discussed. Finally, we summarize the most relevant opportunities of cannabinoid pharmacology related to Alzheimer's disease and discuss the potential usefulness of cannabinoids in the clinical treatment of Alzheimer's disease.",35105293,PMC10207907,10.2174/1570159X20666220201091006,1
Engineering extracellular vesicles for Alzheimer's disease: An emerging cell-free approach for earlier diagnosis and treatment,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a debilitating neurodegenerative disorder affecting over five million people globally and has no established cure. Current AD-related treatments only alleviate cognitive and behavioral symptoms and do not address disease onset or progression, underlining the unmet need to create an effective, innovative AD therapeutic. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) have emerged as a new class of nanotherapeutics. These secreted, lipid-bound cellular signaling carriers show promise for potential clinical applications for neurodegenerative diseases like AD. Additionally, analyzing contents and characteristics of patient-derived EVs may address the unmet need for earlier AD diagnostic techniques, informing physicians of altered genetic expression or cellular communications specific to healthy and diseased physiological states. There are numerous recent advances in regenerative medicine using EVs and include bioengineering perspectives to modify EVs, target glial cells in neurodegenerative diseases like AD, and potentially use EVs to diagnose and treat AD earlier.

Ketogenic Diet: A Promising Neuroprotective Composition for Managing Alzheimer's Diseases and its Pathological Mechanisms,"Ketogenic diet and ketone bodies gained significant attention in recent years due to their ability to influence the specific energy metabolism and restoration of mitochondrial homeostasis that can help in hindering the progression of many metabolic diseases, including diabetes and neurodegenerative diseases. A ketogenic diet consists of high fat and low carbohydrate contents, which makes the body glucose deprived and rely on alternative sources (ketone bodies) for energy. It has been initially designed and supplemented for the treatment of epilepsy, and, later, its influence on many energyderiving biochemical pathways made it a highly sorted food supplement for many metabolic diseases and even for bodybuilding and calorie restriction in healthy individuals. Among the reported therapeutic action over a range of diseases, neurodegenerative disorders, especially Alzheimer's disease, gained the attention of many researchers and clinicians because of the higher benefits of the ketogenic diet on this disease. Complex pathology and multiple influencing factors of Alzheimer's disease make exploration of its therapeutic strategies a demanding task. It was a common phenomenon that energy deprivation in neurological disorders, including Alzheimer's disease, progress rapidly. The ability of ketone bodies to stabilize the mitochondrial energy metabolism makes it a suitable intervening agent. In this review, we will discuss various research progress made with regards to ketone bodies/ketogenic diet for the management of Alzheimer's disease and elaborate in detail about the mechanisms that are influenced during their therapeutic action.",34607541,,10.2174/1566524021666211004104703,6
Blood RNA transcripts reveal similar and differential alterations in fundamental cellular processes in Alzheimer's disease and other neurodegenerative diseases,"Background:Dysfunctional processes in Alzheimer's disease and other neurodegenerative diseases lead to neural degeneration in the central and peripheral nervous system. Research demonstrates that neurodegeneration of any kind is a systemic disease that may even begin outside of the region vulnerable to the disease. Neurodegenerative diseases are defined by the vulnerabilities and pathology occurring in the regions affected.Method:A random forest machine learning analysis on whole blood transcriptomes from six neurodegenerative diseases generated unbiased disease-classifying RNA transcripts subsequently subjected to pathway analysis.Results:We report that transcripts of the blood transcriptome selected for each of the neurodegenerative diseases represent fundamental biological cell processes including transcription regulation, degranulation, immune response, protein synthesis, apoptosis, cytoskeletal components, ubiquitylation/proteasome, and mitochondrial complexes that are also affected in the brain and reveal common themes across six neurodegenerative diseases.Conclusion:Neurodegenerative diseases share common dysfunctions in fundamental cellular processes. Identifying regional vulnerabilities will reveal unique disease mechanisms.Highlights:Transcriptomics offer information about dysfunctional processes. Comparing multiple diseases will expose unique malfunctions within diseases. Blood RNA can be used ante mortem to track expression changes in neurodegenerative diseases. Protocol standardization will make public datasets compatible.",36541444,,10.1002/alz.12880,4
Diet and Inflammation in Alzheimer's Disease and Related Chronic Diseases: A Review,"Inflammation is one of the pathological features of the neurodegenerative disease, Alzheimer's disease (AD). A number of additional disorders are likewise associated with a state of chronic inflammation, including obesity, cardiovascular disease, and type-2 diabetes, which are themselves risk factors for AD. Dietary components have been shown to modify the inflammatory process at several steps of the inflammatory pathway. This review aims to evaluate the published literature on the effect of consumption of pro- or anti-inflammatory dietary constituents on the severity of both AD pathology and related chronic diseases, concentrating on the dietary constituents of flavonoids, spices, and fats. Diet-based anti-inflammatory components could lead to the development of potent novel anti-inflammatory compounds for a range of diseases. However, further work is required to fully characterize the therapeutic potential of such compounds, including gaining an understanding of dose-dependent relationships and limiting factors to effectiveness. Nutritional interventions utilizing anti-inflammatory foods may prove to be a valuable asset in not only delaying or preventing the development of age-related neurodegenerative diseases such as AD, but also treating pre-existing conditions including type-2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and obesity.",26682690,,10.3233/JAD-150765,23
Understanding the contributions of VPS35 and the retromer in neurodegenerative disease,"Perturbations of the endolysosomal pathway have been suggested to play an important role in the pathogenesis of several neurodegenerative diseases, including Parkinson's disease (PD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). Specifically, VPS35 and the retromer complex play an important role in the endolysosomal system and are implicated in the pathophysiology of these diseases. A single missense mutation in VPS35, Asp620Asn (D620N), is known to cause late-onset, autosomal dominant familial PD. In this review, we focus on the emerging role of the PD-linked D620N mutation in causing retromer dysfunction and dissect its implications in neurodegeneration. Additionally, we will discuss how VPS35 and the retromer are linked to AD, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and primary tauopathies. Interestingly, reduced levels of VPS35 and other retromer components have been observed in post-mortem brain tissue, suggesting a role for the retromer in the pathophysiology of these diseases. This review will provide a comprehensive dive into the mechanisms of VPS35 dysfunction in neurodegenerative diseases. Furthermore, we will highlight outstanding questions in the field and the retromer as a therapeutic target for neurodegenerative disease at large.",35588987,PMC9233057,10.1016/j.nbd.2022.105768,8
MicroRNAs in Alzheimer's disease: Potential diagnostic markers and therapeutic targets,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disease, with cognitive decline as the primary clinical feature. According to epidemiological statistics, 50 million people worldwide are currently affected by Alzheimer's disease. Although new drugs such as aducanumab have been approved for use in the treatment of AD, none of them have reversed the progression of AD. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small molecule RNAs that exert their biological functions by regulating the expression of intracellular proteins, and differential abundance and varieties are found between the central and peripheral tissues of AD patients and healthy controls. This article will summarise the changes of miRNAs in the AD process, and the potential role of diagnostic markers and therapeutic targets in AD will be explored.",35177290,,10.1016/j.biopha.2022.112681,26
Proteostasis Disturbances and Inflammation in Neurodegenerative Diseases,"Protein homeostasis (proteostasis) disturbances and inflammation are evident in normal aging and some age-related neurodegenerative diseases. While the proteostasis network maintains the integrity of intracellular and extracellular functional proteins, inflammation is a biological response to harmful stimuli. Cellular stress conditions can cause protein damage, thus exacerbating protein misfolding and leading to an eventual overload of the degradation system. The regulation of proteostasis network is particularly important in postmitotic neurons due to their limited regenerative capacity. Therefore, maintaining balanced protein synthesis, handling unfolding, refolding, and degrading misfolded proteins are essential to preserve all cellular functions in the central nervous sysytem. Failing proteostasis may trigger inflammatory responses in glial cells, and the consequent release of inflammatory mediators may lead to disturbances in proteostasis. Here, we review the mechanisms of proteostasis and inflammatory response, emphasizing their role in the pathological hallmarks of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Furthermore, we discuss the interplay between proteostatic stress and excessive immune response that activates inflammation and leads to dysfunctional proteostasis.",32998318,PMC7601929,10.3390/cells9102183,19
Depression as a Prodromal Symptom of Neurodegenerative Diseases,"Neurodegenerative diseases can manifest as psychiatric symptoms in the prodromal phase, before the onset of core symptoms such as neurological, motor, and cognitive symptoms. Positron emission tomography (PET) has made it possible to detect the pathology of some neurodegenerative diseases in vivo. Many studies have indicated that depression is a preclinical symptom of neurodegenerative diseases. Approximately 10% of non-demented participants with depression developed Alzheimer's disease (AD) during the follow-up period. The prevalence of depression/dysphoria was 42.9% in the preclinical stage of dementia with Lewy bodies. Depression was present in 33.3% of patients with preclinical behavioral-variant frontotemporal lobar degeneration. Approximately 10% of patients had a history of depression at the time of diagnosis with Parkinson's disease. PET studies have revealed the pathology of neurodegenerative diseases in some cases of geriatric depression. Increased brain amyloid-beta deposition in late-onset depression is a possible reflection of prodromal AD. The severity of depression was significantly associated with greater inferior temporal tau and marginally associated with greater entorhinal cortex tau, and depression was associated with significantly greater mean cortical tau deposition. Thus, the presence of depression as a preclinical/prodromal symptom of neurodegenerative diseases has been demonstrated by epidemiological, pathological, and biomarker studies. A growing body of evidence from PET studies indicates that some cases of geriatric depression have pathologies of degenerative neurological disease. In the future, it is expected that PET will be utilized as an imaging biomarker for diagnosis of psychiatric disorders and development of new therapeutic agents.",37258256,,10.1272/jnms.JNMS.2023_90-216,2
Evidence and perspectives of cell senescence in neurodegenerative diseases,"Increased life expectancies have significantly increased the number of individuals suffering from geriatric neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD). The financial cost for current and future patients with these diseases is overwhelming, resulting in substantial economic and societal costs. Unfortunately, most recent high-profile clinical trials for neurodegenerative diseases have failed to obtain efficacious results, indicating that novel approaches are desperately needed to treat these pathologies. Cell senescence, characterized by permanent cell cycle arrest, resistance to apoptosis, mitochondrial alterations, and secretion of senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) components, has been extensively studied in mitotic cells such as fibroblasts, which is considered a hallmark of aging. Furthermore, multiple cell types in the senescent state in the brain, including neurons, microglia, astrocytes, and neural stem cells, have recently been observed in the context of neurodegenerative diseases, suggesting that these senescent cells may play an essential role in the pathological processes of neurodegenerative diseases. Therefore, this review begins by outlining key aspects of cell senescence constitution followed by examining the evidence implicating senescent cells in neurodegenerative diseases. In the final section, we review how cell senescence may be targeted as novel therapeutics to treat pathologies associated with neurodegenerative diseases.",33545662,,10.1016/j.biopha.2021.111327,28
Role of miRNAs in Neurodegeneration: From Disease Cause to Tools of Biomarker Discovery and Therapeutics,"Neurodegenerative diseases originate from neuronal loss in the central nervous system (CNS). These debilitating diseases progress with age and have become common due to an increase in longevity. The National Institute of Environmental Health Science's 2021 annual report suggests around 6.2 million Americans are living with Alzheimer's disease, and there is a possibility that there will be 1.2 million Parkinson's disease patients in the USA by 2030. There is no clear-cut universal mechanism for identifying neurodegenerative diseases, and therefore, they pose a challenge for neurobiology scientists. Genetic and environmental factors modulate these diseases leading to familial or sporadic forms. Prior studies have shown that miRNA levels are altered during the course of the disease, thereby suggesting that these noncoding RNAs may be the contributing factor in neurodegeneration. In this review, we highlight the role of miRNAs in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases. Through this review, we aim to achieve four main objectives: First, we highlight how dysregulation of miRNA biogenesis led to these diseases. Second, we highlight the computational or bioinformatics tools required to identify the putative molecular targets of miRNAs, leading to biological molecular pathways or mechanisms involved in these diseases. Third, we focus on the dysregulation of miRNAs and their target genes leading to several neurodegenerative diseases. In the final section, we highlight the use of miRNAs as potential diagnostic biomarkers in the early asymptomatic preclinical diagnosis of these age-dependent debilitating diseases. Additionally, we discuss the challenges and advances in the development of miRNA therapeutics for brain targeting. We list some of the innovative strategies employed to deliver miRNA into target cells and the relevance of these viral and non-viral carrier systems in RNA therapy for neurodegenerative diseases. In summary, this review highlights the relevance of studying brain-enriched miRNAs, the mechanisms underlying their regulation of target gene expression, their dysregulation leading to progressive neurodegeneration, and their potential for biomarker marker and therapeutic intervention. This review thereby highlights ways for the effective diagnosis and prevention of these neurodegenerative disorders in the near future.",35327979,PMC8951370,10.3390/genes13030425,26
Expression of Alzheimer's disease risk genes in ischemic brain degeneration,"We review the Alzheimer-related expression of genes following brain ischemia as risk factors for late-onset of sporadic Alzheimer's disease and their role in Alzheimer's disease ischemia-reperfusion pathogenesis. More recent advances in understanding ischemic etiology of Alzheimer's disease have revealed dysregulation of Alzheimer-associated genes including amyloid protein precursor, β-secretase, presenilin 1 and 2, autophagy, mitophagy and apoptosis. We review the relationship between these genes dysregulated by brain ischemia and the cellular and neuropathological characteristics of Alzheimer's disease. Here we summarize the latest studies supporting the theory that Alzheimer-related genes play an important role in ischemic brain injury and that ischemia is a needful and leading supplier to the onset and progression of sporadic Alzheimer's disease. Although the exact molecular mechanisms of ischemic dependent neurodegenerative disease and neuronal susceptibility finally are unknown, a downregulated expression of neuronal defense genes like alfa-secretase in the ischemic brain makes the neurons less able to resist injury. The recent challenge is to find ways to raise the adaptive reserve of the brain to overcome such ischemic-associated deficits and support and/or promote neuronal survival. Understanding the mechanisms underlying the association of these genes with risk for Alzheimer's disease will provide the most meaningful targets for therapeutic development to date.",27710863,,10.1016/j.pharep.2016.09.006,9
"Posterior cortical atrophy: clinical, neuroimaging, and neuropathological features","Introduction:Posterior Cortical Atrophy (PCA) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by impairment of higher-order visual processing in the setting of progressive atrophy of the parietal and occipital lobes. The underlying pathology is variable but most commonly Alzheimer's disease. The majority of individuals develop symptoms before 65 years of age; however, delayed diagnosis is common due to misattribution of symptoms to ocular rather than cortical pathology.Areas covered:The purpose of this review is to provide readers with an in-depth analysis of Posterior Cortical Atrophy syndrome, including clinical, imaging, pathological, and genetic features, management, and treatments.Expert opinion:Most patients present initially with a relatively pure visuoperceptual-visuospatial syndrome, though other cognitive domains become affected over time. Structural neuroimaging demonstrates parieto-occipital or temporo-occipital predominant atrophy. Cerebrospinal fluid Alzheimer's disease biomarkers, or amyloid/tau PET imaging can help evaluate for underlying Alzheimer's disease, which is the most common underlying neuropathology. The cornerstone of management is focused on nonpharmacologic measures. Early etiologic diagnosis is important with the arrival of disease-modifying therapies, especially for Alzheimer's disease.",36920752,,10.1080/14737175.2023.2190885,1
Sex-related differences in oxidative stress and neurodegeneration,"Oxidative stress has been implicated in a number of neurodegenerative diseases spanning various fields of research. Reactive oxygen species can be beneficial or harmful, depending on their concentration. High levels of reactive oxygen species can lead to oxidative stress, which is an imbalance between free radicals and antioxidants. Increased oxidative stress can result in cell loss. Interestingly, sex differences have been observed in oxidative stress generation, which may underlie sex differences observed in neurodegenerative disorders. An enhanced knowledge of the role of sex hormones on oxidative stress signaling and cell loss can yield valuable information, leading to sex-based mechanistic approaches to neurodegeneration.",29274405,PMC5864532,10.1016/j.steroids.2017.12.010,41
The effect of epigenetic aging on neurodegenerative diseases: a Mendelian randomization study,"Background:Aging has always been considered as a risk factor for neurodegenerative diseases, but there are individual differences and its mechanism is not yet clear. Epigenetics may unveil the relationship between aging and neurodegenerative diseases.Methods:Our study employed a bidirectional two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) design to assess the potential causal association between epigenetic aging and neurodegenerative diseases. We utilized publicly available summary datasets from several genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Our investigation focused on multiple measures of epigenetic age as potential exposures and outcomes, while the occurrence of neurodegenerative diseases served as potential exposures and outcomes. Sensitivity analyses confirmed the accuracy of the results.Results:The results show a significant decrease in risk of Parkinson's disease with GrimAge (OR = 0.8862, 95% CI 0.7914-0.9924,p= 0.03638). Additionally, we identified that HannumAge was linked to an increased risk of Multiple Sclerosis (OR = 1.0707, 95% CI 1.0056-1.1401,p= 0.03295). Furthermore, we also found that estimated plasminogen activator inhibitor-1(PAI-1) levels demonstrated an increased risk for Alzheimer's disease (OR = 1.0001, 95% CI 1.0000-1.0002,p= 0.04425). Beyond that, we did not observe any causal associations between epigenetic age and neurodegenerative diseases risk.Conclusion:The findings firstly provide evidence for causal association of epigenetic aging and neurodegenerative diseases. Exploring neurodegenerative diseases from an epigenetic perspective may contribute to diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment of neurodegenerative diseases.",38800486,PMC11116635,10.3389/fendo.2024.1372518,0
Ferroptosis: A potential therapeutic target for neurodegenerative diseases,"Ferroptosis is a newly identified regulated form of cell death, which is thought to play a major role in neurodegenerative diseases. In this review, we discuss recent studies elucidating the molecular mechanisms involved in the regulation and execution of ferroptotic cell death and also its role in the brain. Ferroptosis is regulated mainly via iron homeostasis, glutathione metabolism, and lipid peroxidation. Ferroptotic cell death and pro-ferroptotic factors are correlated with the etiopathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). Ferroptosis and etiological factors act synergistically in PD and AD pathogenesis. Furthermore, several preclinical and clinical studies targeting ferroptosis in PD and AD have also shown positive results. Evidence of ferroptosis in the brain thus gives new insights into understanding neurodegenerative diseases. Ferroptosis studies in the brain are still in their infancy, but the existing pieces of evidence suggest a strong correlation between ferroptotic cell death and neurodegenerative diseases. Thus, ferroptosis might be a promising target for treating neurodegenerative diseases.",34047408,,10.1002/jbt.22830,22
The emerging field of epigenetics in neurodegeneration and neuroprotection,"Epigenetic mechanisms - including DNA methylation, histone post-translational modifications and changes in nucleosome positioning - regulate gene expression, cellular differentiation and development in almost all tissues, including the brain. In adulthood, changes in the epigenome are crucial for higher cognitive functions such as learning and memory. Striking new evidence implicates the dysregulation of epigenetic mechanisms in neurodegenerative disorders and diseases. Although these disorders differ in their underlying causes and pathophysiologies, many involve the dysregulation of restrictive element 1-silencing transcription factor (REST), which acts via epigenetic mechanisms to regulate gene expression. Although not somatically heritable, epigenetic modifications in neurons are dynamic and reversible, which makes them good targets for therapeutic intervention.",28515491,PMC6380351,10.1038/nrn.2017.46,133
Epigenome-wide association studies in Alzheimer's disease; achievements and challenges,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) represents a devastating progressive neurodegenerative disease with a complex pathophysiology, affecting millions of people worldwide. Recent epigenome-wide association studies suggest a key role for epigenetic mechanisms in its development and course. Despite the fact that current evidence on the role of epigenetic dysregulation in aging and AD is convincing, the pioneering field of neuroepigenetics is still facing many challenges that need to be addressed to fundamentally increase our understanding about the underlying mechanisms of this neurodegenerative disorder. This perspective paper describes the current state of play for epigenetic research into AD and discusses how new methodological advances in the field of epigenetics and related data science disciplines could further spur the development of novel therapeutic agents and biomarker assays.",32654262,PMC8018126,10.1111/bpa.12880,6
Role of Exosomes in the Pathogenesis and Theranostic of Alzheimer's Disease and Parkinson's Disease,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD) are the most common neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs) threatening the lives of millions of people worldwide, including especially elderly people. Currently, due to the lack of a timely diagnosis and proper intervention strategy, AD and PD largely remain incurable. Innovative diagnosis and therapy are highly desired. Exosomes are small vesicles that are present in various bodily fluids, which contain proteins, nucleic acids, and active biomolecules, and which play a crucial role especially in intercellular communication. In recent years, the role of exosomes in the pathogenesis, early diagnosis, and treatment of diseases has attracted ascending attention. However, the exact role of exosomes in the pathogenesis and theragnostic of AD and PD has not been fully illustrated. In the present review, we first introduce the biogenesis, components, uptake, and function of exosomes. Then we elaborate on the involvement of exosomes in the pathogenesis of AD and PD. Moreover, the application of exosomes in the diagnosis and therapeutics of AD and PD is also summarized and discussed. Additionally, exosomes serving as drug carriers to deliver medications to the central nervous system are specifically addressed. The potential role of exosomes in AD and PD is explored, discussing their applications in diagnosis and treatment, as well as their current limitations. Given the limitation in the application of exosomes, we also propose future perspectives for better utilizing exosomes in NDDs. Hopefully, it would pave ways for expanding the biological applications of exosomes in fundamental research as well as theranostics of NDDs.",37446231,PMC10341856,10.3390/ijms241311054,2
Stem Cells: Innovative Therapeutic Options for Neurodegenerative Diseases?,"Neurodegenerative diseases are characterized by the progressive loss of structure and/or function of both neurons and glial cells, leading to different degrees of pathology and loss of cognition. The hypothesis of circuit reconstruction in the damaged brain via direct cell replacement has been pursued extensively so far. In this context, stem cells represent a useful option since they provide tissue restoration through the substitution of damaged neuronal cells with exogenous stem cells and create a neuro-protective environment through the release of bioactive molecules for healthy neurons, as well. These peculiar properties of stem cells are opening to potential therapeutic strategies for the treatment of severe neurodegenerative disorders, for which the absence of effective treatment options leads to an increasingly socio-economic burden. Currently, the introduction of new technologies in the field of stem cells and the implementation of alternative cell tissues sources are pointing to exciting frontiers in this area of research. Here, we provide an update of the current knowledge about source and administration routes of stem cells, and review light and shadows of cells replacement therapy for the treatment of the three main neurodegenerative disorders (Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Parkinson's, and Alzheimer's disease).",34440761,PMC8391848,10.3390/cells10081992,10
Proteopathic Strains and the Heterogeneity of Neurodegenerative Diseases,"Most age-related neurodegenerative diseases are associated with the misfolding and aberrant accumulation of specific proteins in the nervous system. The proteins self-assemble and spread by a prion-like process of corruptive molecular templating, whereby abnormally folded proteins induce the misfolding and aggregation of like proteins into characteristic lesions. Despite the apparent simplicity of this process at the molecular level, diseases such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, Creutzfeldt-Jakob, and others display remarkable phenotypic heterogeneity, both clinically and pathologically. Evidence is growing that this variability is mediated, at least in part, by the acquisition of diverse molecular architectures by the misfolded proteins, variants referred to as proteopathic strains. The structural and functional diversity of the assemblies is influenced by genetic, epigenetic, and local contextual factors. Insights into proteopathic strains gleaned from the classical prion diseases can be profitably incorporated into research on other neurodegenerative diseases. Their potentially wide-ranging influence on disease phenotype also suggests that proteopathic strains should be considered in the design and interpretation of diagnostic and therapeutic approaches to these disorders.",27893962,PMC6690197,10.1146/annurev-genet-120215-034943,32
Astroglial activation: Current concepts and future directions,"Astrocytes are abundantly and ubiquitously expressed cell types with diverse functions throughout the central nervous system. Astrocytes show remarkable plasticity and exhibit morphological, molecular, and functional remodeling in response to injury, disease, or infection of the central nervous system, as evident in neurodegenerative diseases. Astroglial mediated inflammation plays a prominent role in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases. This review focus on the role of astrocytes as essential players in neuroinflammation and discuss their morphological and functional heterogeneity in the normal central nervous system and explore the spatial and temporal variations in astroglial phenotypes observed under different disease conditions. This review discusses the intimate relationship of astrocytes to pathological hallmarks of neurodegenerative diseases. Finally, this review considers the putative therapeutic strategies that can be deployed to modulate the astroglial functions in neurodegenerative diseases. HIGHLIGHTS: Astroglia mediated neuroinflammation plays a key role in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases. Activated astrocytes exhibit diverse phenotypes in a region-specific manner in brain and interact with β-amyloid, tau, and α-synuclein species as well as with microglia and neuronal circuits. Activated astrocytes are likely to influence the trajectory of disease progression of neurodegenerative diseases, as determined by the stage of disease, individual susceptibility, and state of astroglial priming. Modulation of astroglial activation may be a therapeutic strategy at various stages in the trajectory of neurodegenerative diseases to modify the disease course.",38305570,PMC11032537,10.1002/alz.13678,0
Determinants of approved acetylcholinesterase inhibitor response outcomes in Alzheimer's disease: relevance for precision medicine in neurodegenerative diseases,"Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (ChEI) are the global standard of care for the symptomatic treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and show significant positive effects in neurodegenerative diseases with cognitive and behavioral symptoms. Although experimental and large-scale clinical evidence indicates the potential long-term efficacy of ChEI, primary outcomes are generally heterogeneous across outpatient clinics and regional healthcare systems. Sub-optimal dosing or slow tapering, heterogeneous guidelines about the timing for therapy initiation (prodromal versus dementia stages), healthcare providers' ambivalence to treatment, lack of disease awareness, delayed medical consultation, prescription of ChEI in non-AD cognitive disorders, contribute to the negative outcomes. We present an evidence-based overview of determinants, spanning genetic, molecular, and large-scale networks, involved in the response to ChEI in patients with AD and other neurodegenerative diseases. A comprehensive understanding of cerebral and retinal cholinergic system dysfunctions along with ChEI response predictors in AD is crucial since disease-modifying therapies will frequently be prescribed in combination with ChEI. Therapeutic algorithms tailored to genetic, biological, clinical (endo)phenotypes, and disease stages will help leverage inter-drug synergy and attain optimal combined response outcomes, in line with the precision medicine model.",36526257,,10.1016/j.arr.2022.101819,6
Ultrasensitive techniques and protein misfolding amplification assays for biomarker-guided reconceptualization of Alzheimer's and other neurodegenerative diseases,"Introduction:The clinical validation and qualification of biomarkers reflecting the complex pathophysiology of neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs) is a fundamental challenge for current drug discovery and development and next-generation clinical practice. Novel ultrasensitive detection techniques and protein misfolding amplification assays hold the potential to optimize and accelerate this process.Areas covered:Here we perform a PubMed-based state of the art review and perspective report on blood-based ultrasensitive detection techniques and protein misfolding amplification assays for biomarkers discovery and development in NDDs.Expert opinion:Ultrasensitive assays represent innovative solutions for blood-based assessments during the entire Alzheimer's disease (AD) biological and clinical continuum, for contexts of use (COU) such as prediction, detection, early diagnosis, and prognosis of AD. Moreover, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)-based misfolding amplification assays show encouraging performance in detecting α-synucleinopathies in prodromal or at-high-risk individuals and may serve as tools for patients' stratification by the presence of α-synuclein pathology. Further clinical research will help overcome current methodological limitations, also through exploring multiple accessible bodily matrices. Eventually, integrative longitudinal studies will support precise definitions for appropriate COU across NDDs.",34365867,,10.1080/14737175.2021.1965879,3
Immunotherapy: An emerging treatment option for neurodegenerative diseases,"Accumulation of misfolded proteins and protein aggregates leading to degeneration of neurons is a hallmark of several neurodegenerative diseases. Therapy mostly relies on symptomatic relief. Immunotherapy offers a promising approach for the development of disease-modifying routes. Such strategies have shown remarkable results in oncology, and this promise is increasingly being realized for neurodegenerative diseases in advanced preclinical and clinical studies. This review highlights cases of passive and active immunotherapies in Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases. The reasons for success and failure, wherever available, and strategies to cross the blood-brain barrier, are discussed. The need for conditional modulation of the immune response is also reflected on.",38555032,,10.1016/j.drudis.2024.103974,0
Caspases: therapeutic targets in neurologic disease,"Specific therapies for neurologic diseases such as Alzheimer's disease provide the potential for better clinical outcomes. Expression of caspases in the brain is developmentally regulated, and dysregulated in neurologic disease, supporting that caspases may be therapeutic targets. The activity of caspases is carefully regulated via binding partners, cleavage, or endogenous inhibitors to prevent spontaneous activation, which could lead to aberrant cell death. This review serves as a brief examination of the current understanding of the regulation and function of caspases, and approaches to specifically target aberrant caspase activity. The use of proper tools to investigate individual caspases is addressed. Moreover, it summarizes the reports of various caspases in Alzheimer's disease studies. A better understanding of specific caspase pathways in heath and neurodegenerative disease is crucial for identifying specific targets for the development of therapeutic interventions.",25339539,PMC4322071,10.1007/s13311-014-0307-9,17
Natural Terpenoids as Neuroinflammatory Inhibitors in LPS-stimulated BV-2 Microglia,"Neuroinflammation is a typical feature of many neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. Microglia, the resident immune cells of the brain, readily become activated in response to an infection or an injury. Uncontrolled and overactivated microglia can release pro-inflammatory and cytotoxic factors and are the major culprits in neuroinflammation. Hence, research on novel neuroinflammatory inhibitors is of paramount importance for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases. Bacterial lipopolysaccharide, widely used in the studies of brain inflammation, initiates several major cellular activities that critically contribute to the pathogenesis of neuroinflammation. This review will highlight the progress on terpenoids, an important and structurally diverse group of natural compounds, as neuroinflammatory inhibitors in lipopolysaccharidestimulated BV-2 microglial cells over the last 20 years.",31198113,,10.2174/1389557519666190611124539,7
[Testosterone and Alzheimer's disease],"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease that causes dementia in half of the cases. Asthma is usually found in people over 65 years of age. The etiopathogenesis of the disease is multifactorial and includes genetic factors, nutritional disorders, mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, and aging. Sex hormones have an important influence on the development of AD, as evidenced by a higher incidence in women than in men. Considering the significant influence of T on the maintenance of normal brain function, the present study is aimed at evaluating the impact of androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), as well as testosterone therapy, on the risk of AD development and progression. Although there is some clinical inconsistency between studies, androgens have a significant effect on brain function and are beneficial for AD patients. Low levels of circulating androgens should be considered as a significant risk factor for the development of AD and memory loss. With a reduced level of T in the plasma of men, its administration improves cognitive performance and memory, treatment should be started at an early stage of the disease. In men and women with AD, androgens improve mental state and slow the progression of the disease, providing a protective effect. In the future, it is necessary to conduct studies on a large population, taking into account personality factors and a more specific approach to assessing cognitive functions and the causal relationship of T administration in AD.",36337024,PMC9762454,10.14341/probl13136,1
Age related neurodegenerative Alzheimer's disease: Usage of traditional herbs in therapeutics,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common progressive neurodegenerative disease mainly associated with cognition impairment. Studies in last more than six decades have suggested that the disease pathology primarily includes the depleted cholinergic neurons, accumulation of amyloid beta plaques and hyper phosphorylation of tau proteins. However, the disease etiology remains enigmatic and no therapy is available to modify the disease status. Studies in experimental models and in post mortem brain of AD patients have suggested the involvement of oxidative stress, inflammatory responses, unfolded protein responses and apoptosis in disease pathology, yet the information is deficit to develop the disease modifying therapeutics. Owing to the need of novel effective treatment, chronic consumption of medicines with minimum side effects, recently the researchers turned towards the traditional medicines. This review is mainly focusing on the traditional herbs which have been suggested to contain disease related antidote activities and may be utilized for the effective treatment of AD patients.",31816333,,10.1016/j.neulet.2019.134679,4
Impact of TRPV1 on Pathogenesis and Therapy of Neurodegenerative Diseases,"Transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) is a transmembrane and non-selective cation channel protein, which can be activated by various physical and chemical stimuli. Recent studies have shown the strong pathogenetic associations of TRPV1 with neurodegenerative diseases (NDs), in particular Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD) and multiple sclerosis (MS) via regulating neuroinflammation. Therapeutic effects of TRPV1 agonists and antagonists on the treatment of AD and PD in animal models also are emerging. We here summarize the current understanding of TRPV1's effects and its agonists and antagonists as a therapeutic means in neurodegenerative diseases, and highlight future treatment strategies using natural TRPV1 agonists. Developing new targets and applying natural products are becoming a promising direction in the treatment of chronic disorders, especially neurodegenerative diseases.",38202764,PMC10779880,10.3390/molecules29010181,0
Therapeutic approach to pain in neurodegenerative diseases: current evidence and perspectives,"Neurodegenerative diseases are increasing in parallel to the lengthening of survival. The management of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other dementias, Parkinson's disease (PD) and PD-related disorders, and motor neuron diseases (MND), is mainly targeted to motor and cognitive impairment, with special care for vital functions such as breathing and feeding. Areas covered: The present review focuses on chronic pain in main neurodegenerative diseases, addressing current evidence on pain therapeutic management, pain frequency and clinical features, and possible pathophysiological mechanisms. The search on PubMed had no time limits and was performed by searching for the following key issues: pain, dementia, Alzheimer disease, Parkinson's disease, extrapyramidal disorders, motoneuronal disease, Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, FXTAS, frequency, pathophysiology, treatments, therapy, efficacy, opioids, side effects. No controlled therapeutic trials and guidelines are currently available. The effects of current therapies such as L-Dopa or riluzole on pain symptoms are not clear. Emerging evidences on the possible anti-nociceptive effects of cannabis or botulinum toxin might be available soon. Expert commentary: Pain needs to be better evaluated and fully considered in the global management of neurodegenerative disease because a more focused treatment may have a positive impact on the global burden of these devastating disorders.",27400329,,10.1080/14737175.2016.1210512,7
TargetingN-Methyl-d-Aspartate Receptors in Neurodegenerative Diseases,"N-methyl-d-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) are the main class of ionotropic receptors for the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate. They play a crucial role in the permeability of Ca2+ions and excitatory neurotransmission in the brain. Being heteromeric receptors, they are composed of several subunits, including two obligatory GluN1 subunits (eight splice variants) and regulatory GluN2 (GluN2A~D) or GluN3 (GluN3A~B) subunits. Widely distributed in the brain, they regulate other neurotransmission systems and are therefore involved in essential functions such as synaptic transmission, learning and memory, plasticity, and excitotoxicity. The present review will detail the structure, composition, and localization of NMDARs, their role and regulation at the glutamatergic synapse, and their impact on cognitive processes and in neurodegenerative diseases (Alzheimer's, Huntington's, and Parkinson's disease). The pharmacology of different NMDAR antagonists and their therapeutic potentialities will be presented. In particular, a focus will be given on fluoroethylnormemantine (FENM), an investigational drug with very promising development as a neuroprotective agent in Alzheimer's disease, in complement to its reported efficacy as a tomography radiotracer for NMDARs and an anxiolytic drug in post-traumatic stress disorder.",38612544,PMC11011887,10.3390/ijms25073733,0
Multifactorial Causation of Alzheimer's Disease Due to COVID-19,"There are several implications of the surge in the incidence of pandemics and epidemics in the last decades. COVID-19 being the most remarkable one, showed the vulnerability of patients with neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's disease (AD). This review studies the pathological interlinks and triggering factors between the two illnesses and proposes a multifactorial pathway of AD causation due to COVID-19. The article evaluates and describes all the postulated hypotheses which explain the etiology and possible pathogenesis of the disease in four domains: Inflammation & Neurobiochemical interactions, Oxidative Stress, Genetic Factors, and Social Isolation. We believe that a probable hypothesis of an underlying cause of AD after COVID-19 infection could be the interplay of all these factors.",38007649,,10.3233/JAD-230396,0
Molecular imaging of neuropsychiatric symptoms in Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease,"Neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) are very common in neurodegenerative diseases and are a major contributor to disability and caregiver burden. There is accumulating evidence that NPS may be a prodrome and/or a ""risk factor"" of neurodegenerative diseases. The medications used to treat these symptoms in younger patients are not very effective in patients with neurodegenerative disease and may have serious side effects. An understanding of the neurobiology of NPS is critical for the development of more effective intervention strategies. Targeting these symptoms may also have implications for prevention of cognitive or motor decline. Molecular brain imaging represents a bridge between basic and clinical observations and provides many opportunities for translation from animal models and human post-mortem studies to in vivo human studies. Molecular brain imaging studies in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD) are reviewed with a primary focus on positron emission tomography studies of NPS. Future directions for the field of molecular imaging in AD and PD to understand the neurobiology of NPS will be discussed.",25446948,PMC4806385,10.1016/j.neubiorev.2014.11.010,14
Microglia in Alzheimer's disease: A target for immunotherapy,"Microglia are resident Mϕs of the CNS that play pleiotropic functions in brain development and homeostasis. Impaired microglial functions are thought to be involved in the onset and progression of various neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative diseases. Thus, understanding microglia in these settings may indicate new approaches for therapeutic intervention. Here, we review recent evidence implicating microglia in Alzheimer's disease and discuss potential therapeutic strategies targeting microglia and their receptors in this disease.",30725482,,10.1002/JLB.MR0818-319R,45
Epigenetic Changes in Alzheimer's Disease: DNA Methylation and Histone Modification,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a devastating neurodegenerative disorder characterized by progressive cognitive decline and memory loss, imposing a significant burden on affected individuals and their families. Despite the recent promising progress in therapeutic approaches, more needs to be done to understand the intricate molecular mechanisms underlying the development and progression of AD. Growing evidence points to epigenetic changes as playing a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of the disease. The dynamic interplay between genetic and environmental factors influences the epigenetic landscape in AD, altering gene expression patterns associated with key pathological events associated with disease pathogenesis. To this end, epigenetic alterations not only impact the expression of genes implicated in AD pathogenesis but also contribute to the dysregulation of crucial cellular processes, including synaptic plasticity, neuroinflammation, and oxidative stress. Understanding the complex epigenetic mechanisms in AD provides new avenues for therapeutic interventions. This review comprehensively examines the role of DNA methylation and histone modifications in the context of AD. It aims to contribute to a deeper understanding of AD pathogenesis and facilitate the development of targeted therapeutic strategies.",38667333,PMC11049073,10.3390/cells13080719,0
Epigenetic Modifications in Neurological Diseases: Natural Products as Epigenetic Modulators a Treatment Strategy,"Epigenetic modifications, including DNA methylation, covalent histone modifications, and small noncoding RNAs, play a key role in regulating the gene expression. This regulatory mechanism is important in cellular differentiation and development. Recent advances in the field of epigenetics extended the role of epigenetic mechanisms in controlling key biological processes such as genome imprinting and X-chromosome inactivation. Aberrant epigenetic modifications are associated with the development of many diseases. The role of epigenetic modifications in various neurodegenerative disorders including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington disease, epilepsy, and multiple sclerosis is rapidly emerging. The use of epigenetic modifying drugs to treat these diseases has been the interest in recent years. A number of natural products having diverse mechanism of action are used for drug discovery. For many years, natural compounds have been used to treat various neurodegenerative diseases, but the use of such compounds as epigenetic modulators to reverse or treat neurological diseases are not well studied. In this chapter, we mainly focus on how various epigenetic modifications play a key role in neurodegenerative diseases, their mechanism of action, and how it acts as a potential therapeutic target for epigenetic drugs to treat these diseases will be discussed.",27651245,,10.1007/978-3-319-28383-8_1,4
Polygala tenuifolia: a source for anti-Alzheimer's disease drugs,"Context:Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a chronic neurodegenerative disease that originates from central nervous system lesions or recessions. Current estimates suggest that this disease affects over 35 million people worldwide. However, lacking effective drugs is the biggest handicap in treating AD. In traditional Chinese medicine (TCM),Polygala tenuifoliaWilld. (Polygalaceae) is generally used to treat insomnia, memory dysfunction and neurasthenia.Objective:This review article explores the role ofP. tenuifoliaand its active components in anti-Alzheimer's disease.Methods:Literature for the last ten years was obtained through a search on PubMed, SciFinder, CNKI, Google Scholar, Web of Science, Science Direct and China Knowledge Resource Integrated with the following keywords: Polygala tenuifolia, polygalasaponin XXXII (PGS 32), tenuifolin, polygalacic acid, senegenin, tenuigenin, Alzheimer's disease.Results:Polygala tenuifoliaand its active components have multiplex neuroprotective potential associated with AD, such as anti-Aβaggregation, anti-Tau protein, anti-inflammation, antioxidant, anti-neuronal apoptosis, enhancing central cholinergic system and promote neuronal proliferation.Conclusions:Polygala tenuifoliaand its active components exhibit multiple neuroprotective effects. Hence,P. tenuifoliais a potential drug against Alzheimer's disease, especially in terms of prevention.",32429787,PMC7301717,10.1080/13880209.2020.1758732,15
Dysfunction of the neurovascular unit in diabetes-related neurodegeneration,"In current aging societies, diabetes mellitus and neurodegenerative diseases represented by Alzheimer's disease are highly prevalent among adults, especially the elderly all over the world. It is worth noting that a substantial body of evidence suggests diabetes contributes to accelerated neurodegenerative processes and the decline of cognition. Over the last few years, some studies have indicated neurovascular uncoupling and disrupted functional connectivity in the early stages of many neurodegenerative diseases, and the concept of the neurovascular unit (NVU) has been highlighted to understand the initiation and progression of neurodegenerative diseases recently. Considering that some components of the NVU are also demonstrated to have abnormal morphology and function under the condition of diabetes, we propose the hypothesis that diabetes may promote the onset and development of neurodegenerative diseases by impairing the integrity of the NVU, named Diabetes-NVU-Neurodegeneration Hypothesis. The existing body of literature supporting the hypothesis and elucidating the underlying mechanisms will be summarized in this review.",32841897,,10.1016/j.biopha.2020.110656,12
"Cinnamon, a promising prospect towards Alzheimer's disease","Over the last decades, an exponential increase of efforts concerning the treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD) has been practiced. Phytochemicals preparations have a millenary background to combat various pathological conditions. Various cinnamon species and their biologically active ingredients have renewed the interest towards the treatment of patients with mild-to-moderate AD through the inhibition of tau protein aggregation and prevention of the formation and accumulation of amyloid-β peptides into the neurotoxic oligomeric inclusions, both of which are considered to be the AD trademarks. In this review, we presented comprehensive data on the interactions of a number of cinnamon polyphenols (PPs) with oxidative stress and pro-inflammatory signaling pathways in the brain. In addition, we discussed the potential association between AD and diabetes mellitus (DM), vis-à-vis the effluence of cinnamon PPs. Further, an upcoming prospect of AD epigenetic pathophysiological conditions and cinnamon has been sighted. Data was retrieved from the scientific databases such as PubMed database of the National Library of Medicine, Scopus and Google Scholar without any time limitation. The extract of cinnamon efficiently inhibits tau accumulations, Aβ aggregation and toxicity in vivo and in vitro models. Indeed, cinnamon possesses neuroprotective effects interfering multiple oxidative stress and pro-inflammatory pathways. Besides, cinnamon modulates endothelial functions and attenuates the vascular cell adhesion molecules. Cinnamon PPs may induce AD epigenetic modifications. Cinnamon and in particular, cinnamaldehyde seem to be effective and safe approaches for treatment and prevention of AD onset and/or progression. However, further molecular and translational research studies as well as prolonged clinical trials are required to establish the therapeutic safety and efficacy in different cinnamon spp.",29258915,,10.1016/j.phrs.2017.12.011,30
Toxic Protein Spread in Neurodegeneration: Reality versus Fantasy,"Over the past decade, the importance of the propagation of amyloidogenic proteins such as α-synuclein and tau in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases has been supported by numerous neuropathological and experimental studies. While these proteins behave similarly to prions, recent evidence suggests the existence of fundamental differences, as they can propagate in the absence of endogenous template, they do not exhibit a strict 'strain' behavior, and they may not be transmissible between individuals. We therefore propose to name these proteins 'prionoids'. In this review we critically assess the extent of the overlap between these two entities and evaluate how the propagation of prionoids can fit into the wider system dysfunction seen in the brains of patients with Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases.",30442495,,10.1016/j.molmed.2018.09.004,14
Modification of the gut microbiome to combat neurodegeneration,"The gut microbiome was extensively researched for its biological variety and its potential role in propagating diseases outside of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. Recently, a lot of effort was focused on comprehending the gut-brain axis and the bizarre communication between the GI system and the nervous system. Ample amount of studies being carried out also revealed the involvement of the gut microbiome in enhancing the degree of many neurological disorders, including neurodegenerative diseases. It was widely observed that there were distinct microbiome profiles and dysbiosis within patients suffering from Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and multiple sclerosis. Various approaches to re-establish the balance of the gut microbiome, from antibiotic therapy, fecal microbiota transplant, or ingestion of psychobiotics, are discussed within this review within the specific context of combating neurodegenerative diseases. Present studies and clinical trials indicate that although there is an immense potential of gut microbiome modification to be preventive or therapeutic, there are still many intercalated components of the gut-brain axis at play and thus, more research needs to be carried out to delineate microbiome factors that may potentially alleviate symptoms of neurodegeneration.",31095511,,10.1515/revneuro-2019-0005,19
Improving Anti-Neurodegenerative Benefits of Acetylcholinesterase Inhibitors in Alzheimer's Disease: Are Irreversible Inhibitors the Future?,"Decades of research have produced no effective method to prevent, delay the onset, or slow the progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD). In contrast to these failures, acetylcholinesterase (AChE, EC 3.1.1.7) inhibitors slow the clinical progression of the disease and randomized, placebo-controlled trials in prodromal and mild to moderate AD patients have shown AChE inhibitor anti-neurodegenerative benefits in the cortex, hippocampus, and basal forebrain. CNS neurodegeneration and atrophy are now recognized as biomarkers of AD according to the National Institute on Aging-Alzheimer's Association (NIA-AA) criteria and recent evidence shows that these markers are among the earliest signs of prodromal AD, before the appearance of amyloid. The current AChE inhibitors (donepezil, rivastigmine, and galantamine) have short-acting mechanisms of action that result in dose-limiting toxicity and inadequate efficacy. Irreversible AChE inhibitors, with a long-acting mechanism of action, are inherently CNS selective and can more than double CNS AChE inhibition possible with short-acting inhibitors. Irreversible AChE inhibitors open the door to high-level CNS AChE inhibition and improved anti-neurodegenerative benefits that may be an important part of future treatments to more effectively prevent, delay the onset, or slow the progression of AD.",32414155,PMC7279429,10.3390/ijms21103438,27
PARP-1 involvement in neurodegeneration: A focus on Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases,"DNA damage is the prime activator of the enzyme poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase1 (PARP-1) whose overactivation has been proven to be associated with the pathogenesis of numerous central nervous system disorders, such as ischemia, neuroinflammation, and neurodegenerative diseases. Under oxidative stress conditions PARP-1 activity increases, leading to an accumulation of ADP-ribose polymers and NAD(+) depletion, that induces energy crisis and finally cell death. This review aims to explain the contribution of PARP-1 in neurodegenerative diseases, focusing on Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease, to stimulate further studies on this issue and thereby engage a new perspective regarding the design of possible therapeutic agents or the identification of biomarkers.",25881554,,10.1016/j.mad.2015.04.001,100
Necroptosis and Alzheimer's Disease: Pathogenic Mechanisms and Therapeutic Opportunities,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is considered to be the most common neurodegenerative disease, with clinical symptoms encompassing progressive memory loss and cognitive impairment. Necroptosis is a form of programmed necrosis that promotes cell death and neuroinflammation, which further mediates the pathogenesis of several neurodegenerative diseases, especially AD. Current evidence has strongly suggested that necroptosis is activated in AD brains, resulting in neuronal death and cognitive impairment. We searched the PubMed database, screening all articles published before September 28, 2022 related to necroptosis in the context of AD pathology. The keywords in the search included: ""necroptosis"", ""Alzheimer's disease"", ""signaling pathways"", ""Aβ"", Aβo"", ""Tau"", ""p-Tau"", ""neuronal death"", ""BBB damage"", ""neuroinflammation"", ""microglia"", ""mitochondrial dysfunction"", ""granulovacuolar degeneration"", ""synaptic loss"", ""axonal degeneration"", ""Nec-1"", ""Nec-1s"", ""GSK872"", ""NSA"", ""OGA"", ""RIPK1"", ""RIPK3"", and ""MLKL"". Results show that necroptosis has been involved in multiple pathological processes of AD, including amyloid-β aggregation, Tau accumulation, neuronal death, and blood-brain barrier damage, etc. More importantly, existing research on AD necroptosis interventions, including drug intervention and potential gene targets, as well as its current clinical development status, was discussed. Finally, the issues pertaining to necroptosis in AD were presented. Accordingly, this review may provide further insight into clinical perspectives and challenges for the future treatment of AD by targeting the necroptosis pathway.",36463451,PMC10473100,10.3233/JAD-220809,9
New advances in brain-targeting nano-drug delivery systems for Alzheimer's disease,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disease worldwide and its incidence is increasing due to the ageing population. Currently, the main limitations of AD treatment are low blood-brain barrier permeability, severe off-target of drugs, and immune abnormality. In this review, four hypotheses for Alzheimer's pathogenesis and three challenges for Alzheimer's drug delivery are discussed. In addition, this article summarises the different strategies of brain targeting nano-drug delivery systems (NDDSs) developed in the last 10 years. These strategies include receptor-mediated (transferrin receptor, low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein, lactoferrin receptor, etc.), adsorption-mediated (cationic, alkaline polypeptide, cell-penetrating peptides, etc.), and transporter-mediated (P-gp, GLUT1, etc.). Moreover, it provides insights into novel strategies used in AD, such as exosomes, virus-like particles, and cell membrane coating particles. Hence, this review will help researchers to understand the current progress in the field of NDDSs for the central nervous system and find new directions for AD therapy.HighlightsCharacteristics and challenges based on the pathogenesis of AD were discussed.Recent advances in novel brain-targeting NDDSs for AD over the past 10 years were summarised.",33983096,,10.1080/1061186X.2021.1927055,17
Neuromodulation by nanozymes and ultrasound during Alzheimer's disease management,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder with complex pathogenesis and effective clinical treatment strategies for this disease remain elusive. Interestingly, nanomedicines are under extensive investigation for AD management. Currently, existing redox molecules show highly bioactive property but suffer from instability and high production costs, limiting clinical application for neurological diseases. Compared with natural enzymes, artificial enzymes show high stability, long-lasting catalytic activity, and versatile enzyme-like properties. Further, the selectivity and performance of artificial enzymes can be modulated for neuroinflammation treatments through external stimuli. In this review, we focus on the latest developments of metal, metal oxide, carbon-based and polymer based nanozymes and their catalytic mechanisms. Recent developments in nanozymes for diagnosing and treating AD are emphasized, especially focusing on their potential to regulate pathogenic factors and target sites. Various applications of nanozymes with different stimuli-responsive features were discussed, particularly focusing on nanozymes for treating oxidative stress-related neurological diseases. Noninvasiveness and focused application to deep body regions makes ultrasound (US) an attractive trigger mechanism for nanomedicine. Since a complete cure for AD remains distant, this review outlines the potential of US responsive nanozymes to develop future therapeutic approaches for this chronic neurodegenerative disease and its emergence in AD management.",38555420,PMC10981335,10.1186/s12951-024-02406-7,0
Recent Advances in the Roles of MicroRNA and MicroRNA-Based Diagnosis in Neurodegenerative Diseases,"Neurodegenerative diseases manifest as progressive loss of neuronal structures and their myelin sheaths and lead to substantial morbidity and mortality, especially in the elderly. Despite extensive research, there are few effective treatment options for the diseases. MicroRNAs have been shown to be involved in the developmental processes of the central nervous system. Mounting evidence suggest they play an important role in the development of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. However, there are few reviews regarding the roles of miRNAs in neurodegenerative diseases. This review summarizes the recent developments in the roles of microRNAs in neurodegenerative diseases and presents the application of microRNA-based methods in the early diagnosis of these diseases.",36551041,PMC9776063,10.3390/bios12121074,2
The Role of DNA Methylation and Histone Modifications in Neurodegenerative Diseases: A Systematic Review,"Importance:Epigenetic modifications of the genome, such as DNA methylation and histone modifications, have been reported to play a role in neurodegenerative diseases (ND) such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD).Objective:To systematically review studies investigating epigenetic marks in AD or PD.Methods:Eleven bibliographic databases (Embase.com, Medline (Ovid), Web-of-Science, Scopus, PubMed, Cinahl (EBSCOhost), Cochrane Central, ProQuest, Lilacs, Scielo and Google Scholar) were searched until July 11th 2016 to identify relevant articles. We included all randomized controlled trials, cohort, case-control and cross-sectional studies in humans that examined associations between epigenetic marks and ND. Two independent reviewers, with a third reviewer available for disagreements, performed the abstract and full text selection. Data was extracted using a pre-designed data collection form.Results:Of 6,927 searched references, 73 unique case-control studies met our inclusion criteria. Overall, 11,453 individuals were included in this systematic review (2,640 AD and 2,368 PD outcomes). There was no consistent association between global DNA methylation pattern and any ND. Studies reported epigenetic regulation of 31 genes (including cell communication, apoptosis, and neurogenesis genes in blood and brain tissue) in relation to AD and PD. Methylation at the BDNF, SORBS3 and APP genes in AD were the most consistently reported associations. Methylation of α-synuclein gene (SNCA) was also found to be associated with PD. Seven studies reported histone protein alterations in AD and PD.Conclusion:Many studies have investigated epigenetics and ND. Further research should include larger cohort or longitudinal studies, in order to identify clinically significant epigenetic changes. Identifying relevant epigenetic changes could lead to interventional strategies in ND.",27973581,PMC5156363,10.1371/journal.pone.0167201,42
[A new paradigm for the development of neurodegenerative diseases on the example of Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease],"The role of neuronal inflammation developing during the formation of amyloid plaques and Lewy bodies has been investigated. The influence of various exogenous and endogenous factors on the development of neuroinflammation has been established, but the role of various infectious agents in the development of this process has been much less studied. Today, the existence of a universal trigger mechanism of the neurodegenerative process is obvious: a specific pathogen of a bacterial or viral nature (including a long-term persistent in the nervous tissue in a latent state), reactivating, penetrates into certain cerebral structures, where it is influenced by either Aβ or resident macrophages of the central nervous system, which, in turn, are activated and induce the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, leading to the development of neuronal inflammation, autophagy and neurodegeneration. Reactivation of latent, such as herpes, infection in individuals who are carriers of APOE4 significantly increases the risk of developing Alzheimer's disease. Class II genes of the HLA locus (HLA II) may be related to the progression of neurodegenerative diseases. The increase in iron levels in the glia is induced by inflammation, which leads to neurodegeneration. Disruption of the homeostasis of redox-active metals, iron and copper, is an integral part of the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. The developing neuroinflammation leads to the intensification of the processes of peroxidation, oxidation of metals and the development of ferroptosis.",35727933,,,0
DNA methylation in the pathology of Alzheimer's disease: from gene to cognition,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a debilitating disorder that manifests with amyloid beta plaque deposition, neurofibrillary tangles, neuronal loss, and severe cognitive impairment. Although much effort has been made to decipher the pathogenesis of this disease, the mechanisms causing these detrimental outcomes remain obscure. Over the past few decades, neuroepigenetics has emerged as an important field that, among other things, explores how reversible modifications can change gene expression to control behavior and cognitive abilities. Among epigenetic modifications, DNA methylation requires further elucidation for the conflicting observations from AD research and its pivotal role in learning and memory. In this review, we focus on the essential components of DNA methylation, the effects of aberrant methylation on gene expressions in the amyloidogenic pathway and neurochemical processes, as well as memory epigenetics in Alzheimer's disease.",32491215,,10.1111/nyas.14373,15
Targeting neuroplasticity in patients with neurodegenerative diseases using brain stimulation techniques,"Deficits in synaptic transmission and plasticity are thought to contribute to the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD). Several brain stimulation techniques are currently available to assess or modulate human neuroplasticity, which could offer clinically useful interventions as well as quantitative diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers. In this review, we discuss several brain stimulation techniques, with a special emphasis on transcranial magnetic stimulation and deep brain stimulation (DBS), and review the results of clinical studies that applied these techniques to examine or modulate impaired neuroplasticity at the local and network levels in patients with AD or PD. The impaired neuroplasticity can be detected in patients at the earlier and later stages of both neurodegenerative diseases. However, current brain stimulation techniques, with a notable exception of DBS for PD treatment, cannot serve as adequate clinical tools to assist in the diagnosis, treatment, or prognosis of individual patients with AD or PD. Targeting the impaired neuroplasticity with improved brain stimulation techniques could offer a powerful novel approach for the treatment of AD and PD.",33280613,PMC7720463,10.1186/s40035-020-00224-z,9
"Structure and function of the perivascular fluid compartment and vertebral venous plexus: Illumining a novel theory on mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's, cerebral small vessel, and neurodegenerative diseases","Blood dynamically and richly supplies the cerebral tissue via microvessels invested in pia matter perforating the cerebral substance. Arteries penetrating the cerebral substance derive an investment from one or two successive layers of pia mater, luminally apposed to the pial-glial basal lamina of the microvasculature and abluminally apposed to a series of aquaporin IV-studded astrocytic end feet constituting the soi-disant glia limitans. The full investment of successive layers forms the variably continuous walls of the periarteriolar, pericapillary, and perivenular divisions of the perivascular fluid compartment. The pia matter disappears at the distal periarteriolar division of the perivascular fluid compartment. Plasma from arteriolar blood sequentially transudates into the periarteriolar division of the perivascular fluid compartment and subarachnoid cisterns in precession to trickling into the neural interstitium. Fluid from the neural interstitium successively propagates into the venules through the subarachnoid cisterns and perivenular division of the perivascular fluid compartment. Fluid fluent within the perivascular fluid compartment flows gegen the net direction of arteriovenular flow. Microvessel oscillations at the central tendency of the cerebral vasomotion generate corresponding oscillations of within the surrounding perivascular fluid compartment, interposed betwixt the abluminal surface of the vessels and internal surface of the pia mater. The precise microanatomy of this most fascinating among designable spaces has eluded the efforts of various investigators to interrogate its structure, though most authors non-consensusly concur the investing layers effectively and functionally segregate the perivascular and subarachnoid fluid compartments. Enlargement of the perivascular fluid compartment in a variety of neurological disorders, including senile dementia of the Alzheimer's type and cerebral small vessel disease, may alternately or coordinately constitute a correlative marker of disease severity and a possible cause implicated in the mechanistic pathogenesis of these conditions. Venular pressures modulating oscillatory dynamic flow within the perivascular fluid compartment may similarly contribute to the development of a variety among neurological disorders. An intimate understanding of subtle features typifying microanatomy and microphysiology of the investing structures and spaces of the cerebral microvasculature may powerfully inform mechanistic pathophysiology mediating a variety of neurovascular ischemic, neuroinfectious, neuroautoimmune, and neurodegenerative diseases.",32687942,,10.1016/j.nbd.2020.105022,6
Limbic-Predominant Age-Related TDP-43 Encephalopathy: LATE-Breaking Updates in Clinicopathologic Features and Biomarkers,"Purpose of review:Limbic-predominant age-related TDP-43 encephalopathy (LATE) is a recently defined neurodegenerative disease characterized by amnestic phenotype and pathological inclusions of TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43). LATE is distinct from rarer forms of TDP-43 diseases such as frontotemporal lobar degeneration with TDP-43 but is also a common copathology with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and cerebrovascular disease and accelerates cognitive decline. LATE contributes to clinicopathologic heterogeneity in neurodegenerative diseases, so it is imperative to distinguish LATE from other etiologies.Recent findings:Novel biomarkers for LATE are being developed with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and positron emission tomography (PET). When cooccurring with AD, LATE exhibits identifiable patterns of limbic-predominant atrophy on MRI and hypometabolism on18F-fluorodeoxyglucose PET that are greater than expected relative to levels of local AD pathology. Efforts are being made to develop TDP-43-specific radiotracers, molecularly specific biofluid measures, and genomic predictors of TDP-43. LATE is a highly prevalent neurodegenerative disease distinct from previously characterized cognitive disorders.",36190653,PMC9633415,10.1007/s11910-022-01232-4,3
Incretin and insulin signaling as novel therapeutic targets for Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease,"Despite an ever-growing prevalence and increasing economic burden of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD), recent advances in drug development have only resulted in minimally effective treatment. In AD, along with amyloid and tau phosphorylation, there is an associated increase in inflammation/glial activation, a decrease in synaptic function, an increase in astrocyte activation, and a state of insulin resistance. In PD, along with α-synuclein accumulation, there is associated inflammation, synaptic dysfunction, dopaminergic neuronal loss, and some data to suggest insulin resistance. Therapeutic strategies for neurodegenerative disorders have commonly targeted individual pathological processes. An effective treatment might require either utilization of multiple drugs which target the individual pathological processes which underlie the neurodegenerative disease or the use of a single agent which could influence multiple pathological processes. Insulin and incretins are compounds with multiple effects on neurodegenerative processes. Preclinical studies have demonstrated that GLP-1 receptor agonists reduce neuroinflammation, reduce tau phosphorylation, reduce amyloid deposition, increase synaptic function, and improve memory formation. Incretin mimetics may act through the restoration of insulin signaling pathways, inducing further neuroprotective effects. Currently, phase 2 and phase 3 trials are underway in AD and PD populations. Here, we provide a comprehensive review of the therapeutic potential of incretin mimetics and insulin in AD and PD.",36258018,PMC9812772,10.1038/s41380-022-01792-4,19
Causal Association Between Sepsis and Neurodegenerative Diseases: A Bidirectional Two-Sample Mendelian Randomization Study,"Background:Previous observational studies suggested an association between sepsis and neurodegenerative diseases, but causality remains unclear.Objective:Determining the causal association between sepsis and four neurodegenerative diseases (Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and Lewy body dementia) through bidirectional two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis.Methods:Genome-wide association study summary statistics for all traits were obtained from publicly available databases. Inverse variance weighted (IVW) was the primary method for evaluating causal associations. In addition, three additional MR methods (MR-Egger, weighted median, and maximum likelihood method) were employed to supplement IVW. Furthermore, various sensitivity tests were conducted to assess the reliability: 1) Cochrane's Q test for assessing heterogeneity; 2) MR-Egger intercept test and MR-PRESSO global test for evaluating horizontal pleiotropy; 3) leave-one-out sensitivity test for determining the stability.Results:The results of IVW indicated that sepsis significantly increased the risk of Alzheimer's disease (OR = 1.11, 95% CI: 1.01-1.21, p = 0.025). In addition, three additional MR methods suggested parallel results. However, no causal effect of sepsis on the three other neurodegenerative diseases was identified. Subsequently, reverse MR analysis indicated that the four neurodegenerative diseases do not causally affect sepsis. Furthermore, sensitivity tests demonstrated the reliability of the MR analyses, suggesting no heterogeneity or horizontal pleiotropy.Conclusions:The present study contributes to a deeper comprehension of the intricate interplay between sepsis and neurodegenerative disorders, thereby offering potential avenues for the development of therapeutic agents that can effectively mitigate the multifarious complications associated with sepsis.",38189756,,10.3233/JAD-230954,0
Role of Hypoxia Inducible Factor-1α in Alzheimer's Disease,"Amyloid-β (Aβ) peptides and hyperphosphorylated tau protein are the most important pathological markers of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Neuroinflammation and oxidative stress are also involved in the development and pathological mechanism of AD. Hypoxia inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) is a transcriptional factor responsible for cellular and tissue adaption to low oxygen tension. Emerging evidence has revealed HIF-1α as a potential medicinal target for neurodegenerative diseases. On the one hand, HIF-1α increases AβPP processing and Aβ generation by promoting β/γ-secretases and suppressing α-secretases, inactivates microglia and reduces their activity, contributes to microglia death and neuroinflammation, which promotes AD pathogenesis. On the other hand, HIF-1α could resist the toxic effect of Aβ, inhibits tau hyperphosphorylation and promotes microglial activation. In summary, this review focuses on the potential complex roles and the future perspectives of HIF-1α in AD, in order to provide references for seeking new drug targets and treatment methods for AD.",33612545,,10.3233/JAD-201448,12
Novel GLP-1 (Glucagon-Like Peptide-1) Analogues and Insulin in the Treatment for Alzheimer's Disease and Other Neurodegenerative Diseases,"The link between diabetes mellitus and Alzheimer's disease (AD) has been known for the last few decades. Since insulin and insulin receptors are known to be present in the brain, the downstream signalling as well as the effect of hyperinsulinemia have been extensively studied in both AD and Parkinson's disease. Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) is a hormone belonging to the incretin family, and its receptors (GLP-1Rs) can be found in pancreatic cells and in vascular endothelium. Interestingly, GLP-1Rs are found in the neuronal cell body and dendrites in the central nervous system (CNS), in particular in the hypothalamus, hippocampus, cerebral cortex and olfactory bulb. Several studies have shown the importance of both insulin and GLP-1 signalling on cognitive function, and many preclinical studies have been performed to evaluate the potential protective role of GLP-1 on the brain. Here we review the underlying mechanism of insulin and GLP-1 signalling in the CNS, as well as the preclinical data for the use of GLP-1 analogues such as liraglutide, exenatide and lixisenatide in neurodegenerative diseases.",26666230,,10.1007/s40263-015-0301-8,30
Treating neurodegenerative diseases with multitarget drugs: an interview with Maria João Matos,"Neurodegenerative diseases are one of the leading causes of death, disability and dependency worldwide. Since the etiology of these complex pathologies is not completely known, the available therapeutic options can only cause temporary relief of the symptoms, but cannot cure them. Life-changing therapeutic solutions are urgently needed, as the number of people suffering from these pathologies has been increasing quickly over the last few decades. Recent studies regarding the paradigm of using multitarget compounds to treat both Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases have been analyzed and included in the review entitled""Multitarget therapeutic approaches for Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases: an opportunity or an illusion?"".

"How strong is the relationship between glaucoma, the retinal nerve fibre layer, and neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease and multiple sclerosis?","Glaucoma is a neurodegenerative disorder with established relationships with ocular structures such as the retinal nerve fibre layer (RNFL) and the ganglion cell layer (GCL). Ocular imaging techniques such as optical coherence tomography (OCT) allow for quantitative measurement of these structures. OCT has been used in the monitoring of glaucoma, as well as investigating other neurodegenerative conditions such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) and multiple sclerosis (MS). In this review, we highlight the association between these disorders and ocular structures (RNFL and GCL), examining their usefulness as biomarkers of neurodegeneration. The average RNFL thickness loss in patients with AD is 11 μm, and 7 μm in MS patients. Most of the studies investigating these changes are cross-sectional. Further longitudinal studies are required to assess sensitivity and specificity of these potential ocular biomarkers to neurodegenerative disease progression.",26337943,PMC4815693,10.1038/eye.2015.158,36
Opportunities for Cellular Rejuvenation in Alzheimer's Disease: How Epigenetic Reprogramming and Chaperone-Mediated Autophagy Are Enabling Next Generation Therapeutic Approaches,"Age remains the largest risk factor in the development of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). Numerous cellular hallmarks of aging contribute to the advancement of the pathologies associated with neurodegenerative disease. Not all cellular hallmarks of aging are independent and several fall into the broader category of cellular rejuvenation, which captures returning cells to a more youthful, improved functional state. Cellular rejuvenation is quickly becoming a hot topic in the development of novel therapeutic modalities for a range of diseases. Therapeutic approaches utilizing cellular rejuvenation technologies are rapidly advancing and will represent the next phase of AD therapeutics. This review focuses on two important processes, epigenetic reprogramming, and chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA) that play a critical role in aging and in neurodegenerative diseases and the potential therapeutic approaches (gene therapy, small molecule) towards targeting these mechanisms. In aging and in AD, epigenetic changes on DNA (e.g., hypermethylation on CpG islands) lead to alterations in gene expression. Partial epigenetic reprogramming utilizes transcription factors to remove the epigenetic marks and to rejuvenate cells to a more youthful state. During aging and in neurodegenerative disorders, CMA becomes impaired resulting in a buildup of proteins known to be associated with neurodegenerative pathologies. The protein buildups lead to aggregates that preclude proteostasis leading to cell toxicity. Small-molecule CMA activators restore proteostasis and limit toxicity enabling cellular rejuvenation.",37874086,,10.14283/jpad.2023.106,0
MR Brain Screening using Optimization Techniques - A Survey,"Background:Alzheimer's disease (AD) is associated with Dementia, and it is also a memory syndrome in the brain. It affects the brain tissues and causes major changes in day-to-day activities. Aging is a major cause of Alzheimer's disease. AD is characterized by two pathological hallmarks, Amyloid β protein and neurofibrillary tangles of hyperphosphorylated tau protein. The imaging hallmarks for Alzheimer's disease are swelling, shrinkage of brain tissues due to cell loss, and atrophy in the brain due to protein dissemination. Based on the survey, 60% to 80% of dementia patients belong to Alzheimer's disease.Introduction:AD is now becoming an important brain disease. The goal of AD pathology is to cause changes/damage in brain tissues. Alzheimer's disease is thought to begin 20 years or more before symptoms appear, with tiny changes in the brain that are undetectable to the person affected. The changes in a person's brain after a few years are noticeable through symptoms such as language difficulties and memory loss. Neurons in different parts of the brain have detected symptoms such as cognitive impairments and learning disabilities. In this case, neuroimaging tools are necessary to identify the development of pathology which relates to the clinical symptoms.Methods:Several approaches have been tried during the last two decades for brain screening to analyse AD using pre-processing, segmentation, and classification. Different individuals, such as Grey Wolf optimization, Lion Optimization, Ant Lion Optimization, etc., have been attempted in the proposed study. Similarly, hybrid optimization techniques are also attempted to segment the brain sub-regions, which helps in identifying the biomarkers to analyse AD.Conclusion:This study discusses a review of neuroimaging technologies for diagnosing Alzheimer's disease, as well as the discovery of hallmarks for the disease and the methodologies for finding hallmarks from brain images to evaluate AD. According to the literature review, most of the techniques predicted higher accuracy (more than 90%), which is beneficial for assessing and screening neurodegenerative disease, particularly Alzheimer's disease.",34825877,,10.2174/1573405617666211126154101,0
Mitochondria in Alzheimer's Disease and Diabetes-Associated Neurodegeneration: License to Heal!,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a difficult puzzle to solve, in part because the etiology of this devastating neurodegenerative disorder remains murky. However, diabetes has been pinpointed as a major risk factor for the sporadic forms of AD. Several overlapping neurodegenerative mechanisms have been identified between AD and diabetes, including mitochondrial malfunction. This is not surprising taking into account that neurons are cells with a complex morphology, long lifespan, and high energetic requirements which make them particularly reliant on a properly organized and dynamic mitochondrial network to sustain neuronal function and integrity. In this sense, this chapter provides an overview on the role of mitochondrial bioenergetics and dynamics to the neurodegenerative events that occur in AD and diabetes, and how these organelles may represent a mechanistic link between these two pathologies. From a therapeutic perspective, it will be discussed how mitochondria can be targeted in order to efficaciously counteract neurodegeneration associated with AD and diabetes.",28251365,,10.1007/164_2017_3,12
"Autophagy, its mechanisms and regulation: Implications in neurodegenerative diseases","Autophagy is a major regulatory cellular mechanism which gives the cell an ability to cope with some of the destructive events that normally occur within a metabolically living cell. This is done by maintaining the cellular homeostasis, clearance of damaged organelles and proteins and recycling necessary molecules like amino acids and fatty acids. There is a wide array of factors that influence autophagy in the state of health and disease. Disruption of these mechanisms may not only give rise to several autophagy-related disease, but also it can occur as the result of intracellular changes induced during disease pathogenesis causing exacerbation of the disease. Our knowledge is increasing regarding the role of autophagy and its mechanisms in the pathogenesis of various neurodegenerative diseases such as multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's disease and Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Indeed, getting to know about the pathways of autophagy and its regulation can provide the basis for designing therapeutic interventions. In the present paper, we review the pathways of autophagy, its regulation and the possible autophagy-targeting interventions for the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders.",28923312,,10.1016/j.arr.2017.09.005,45
Role of primary aging hallmarks in Alzheimer´s disease,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disease, which severely threatens the health of the elderly and causes significant economic and social burdens. The causes of AD are complex and include heritable but mostly aging-related factors. The primary aging hallmarks include genomic instability, telomere wear, epigenetic changes, and loss of protein stability, which play a dominant role in the aging process. Although AD is closely associated with the aging process, the underlying mechanisms involved in AD pathogenesis have not been well characterized. This review summarizes the available literature about primary aging hallmarks and their roles in AD pathogenesis. By analyzing published literature, we attempted to uncover the possible mechanisms of aberrant epigenetic markers with related enzymes, transcription factors, and loss of proteostasis in AD. In particular, the importance of oxidative stress-induced DNA methylation and DNA methylation-directed histone modifications and proteostasis are highlighted. A molecular network of gene regulatory elements that undergoes a dynamic change with age may underlie age-dependent AD pathogenesis, and can be used as a new drug target to treat AD.",36593969,PMC9800733,10.7150/thno.79535,6
Repurposing small-molecule drugs for modulating toxic protein aggregates in neurodegenerative diseases,"Neurodegenerative diseases (NDs) are often age-related disorders that can cause dementia in people, usually over 65 years old, are still lacking effective therapies. Some NDs have recently been linked to toxic protein aggregates, for example Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and Huntington disease; therefore, mulating toxic protein aggregates would be a promising therapeutic strategy. Moreover, drug repurposing, in other words exploiting drugs that are already in use for another indication, has been attracting mounting attention for potential therapeutic purposes in NDs. Thus, in this review, we focus on summarizing a series of repurposed small-molecule drugs for eliminating or inhibiting toxic protein aggregates and further discuss their intricate molecular mechanisms to improve the current ND treatment. Taken together, these findings will shed new light on exploiting more repurposed small-molecule drugs targeting different types of toxic proteins to fight NDs in the future.",35395400,,10.1016/j.drudis.2022.04.003,9
Epigenetics of Aging and Alzheimer's Disease: Implications for Pharmacogenomics and Drug Response,"Epigenetic variability (DNA methylation/demethylation, histone modifications, microRNA regulation) is common in physiological and pathological conditions. Epigenetic alterations are present in different tissues along the aging process and in neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). Epigenetics affect life span and longevity. AD-related genes exhibit epigenetic changes, indicating that epigenetics might exert a pathogenic role in dementia. Epigenetic modifications are reversible and can potentially be targeted by pharmacological intervention. Epigenetic drugs may be useful for the treatment of major problems of health (e.g., cancer, cardiovascular disorders, brain disorders). The efficacy and safety of these and other medications depend upon the efficiency of the pharmacogenetic process in which different clusters of genes (pathogenic, mechanistic, metabolic, transporter, pleiotropic) are involved. Most of these genes are also under the influence of the epigenetic machinery. The information available on the pharmacoepigenomics of most drugs is very limited; however, growing evidence indicates that epigenetic changes are determinant in the pathogenesis of many medical conditions and in drug response and drug resistance. Consequently, pharmacoepigenetic studies should be incorporated in drug development and personalized treatments.",26703582,PMC4691177,10.3390/ijms161226236,41
Understanding Epigenetics in the Neurodegeneration of Alzheimer's Disease: SAMP8 Mouse Model,"Epigenetics is emerging as the missing link among genetic inheritance, environmental influences, and body and brain health status. In the brain, specific changes in nucleic acids or their associated proteins in neurons and glial cells might imprint differential patterns of gene activation that will favor either cognitive enhancement or cognitive loss for more than one generation. Furthermore, derangement of age-related epigenetic signaling is appearing as a significant risk factor for illnesses of aging, including neurodegeneration and Alzheimer's disease (AD). In addition, better knowledge of epigenetic mechanisms might provide hints and clues in the triggering and progression of AD. Intense research in experimental models suggests that molecular interventions for modulating epigenetic mechanisms might have therapeutic applications to promote cognitive maintenance through an advanced age. The SAMP8 mouse is a senescence model with AD traits in which the study of epigenetic alterations may unveil epigenetic therapies against the AD.",29562529,PMC5870033,10.3233/JAD-170664,42
"Relationship between Nutrition, Lifestyle, and Neurodegenerative Disease: Lessons fromADH1B,CYP1A2andMTHFR","In the present review, the main features involved in the susceptibility and progression of neurodegenerative disorders (NDDs) have been discussed, with the purpose of highlighting their potential application for promoting the management and treatment of patients with NDDs. In particular, the impact of genetic and epigenetic factors, nutrients, and lifestyle will be presented, with particular emphasis on Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD). Metabolism, dietary habits, physical exercise and microbiota are part of a complex network that is crucial for brain function and preservation. This complex equilibrium can be disrupted by genetic, epigenetic, and environmental factors causing perturbations in central nervous system homeostasis, contributing thereby to neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration. Diet and physical activity can directly act on epigenetic modifications, which, in turn, alter the expression of specific genes involved in NDDs onset and progression. On this subject, the introduction of nutrigenomics shed light on the main molecular players involved in the modulation of health and disease status. In particular, the review presents data concerning the impact ofADH1B,CYP1A2,andMTHFRon the susceptibility and progression of NDDs (especially AD and PD) and how they may be exploited for developing precision medicine strategies for the disease treatment and management.",36011409,PMC9408177,10.3390/genes13081498,0
Differential Role of Active Compounds in Mitophagy and Related Neurodegenerative Diseases,"Neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease or Parkinson's disease, significantly reduce the quality of life of patients and eventually result in complete maladjustment. Disruption of the synapses leads to a deterioration in the communication of nerve cells and decreased plasticity, which is associated with a loss of cognitive functions and neurodegeneration. Maintaining proper synaptic activity depends on the qualitative composition of mitochondria, because synaptic processes require sufficient energy supply and fine calcium regulation. The maintenance of the qualitative composition of mitochondria occurs due to mitophagy. The regulation of mitophagy is usually based on several internal mechanisms, as well as on signals and substances coming from outside the cell. These substances may directly or indirectly enhance or weaken mitophagy. In this review, we have considered the role of some compounds in process of mitophagy and neurodegeneration. Some of them have a beneficial effect on the functions of mitochondria and enhance mitophagy, showing promise as novel drugs for the treatment of neurodegenerative pathologies, while others contribute to a decrease in mitophagy.",36977093,PMC10058020,10.3390/toxins15030202,5
