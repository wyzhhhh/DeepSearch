31891371,"A multiomics approach to heterogeneity in Alzheimer's disease: focused review and        roadmap.",10.1093/brain/awz384,"Aetiological and clinical heterogeneity is increasingly recognized as a common        characteristic of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias. This heterogeneity        complicates diagnosis, treatment, and the design and testing of new drugs. An        important line of research is discovery of multimodal biomarkers that will        facilitate the targeting of subpopulations with homogeneous pathophysiological        signatures. High-throughput 'omics' are unbiased data-driven techniques that        probe the complex aetiology of Alzheimer's disease from multiple levels (e.g.        network, cellular, and molecular) and thereby account for pathophysiological        heterogeneity in clinical populations. This review focuses on data reduction        analyses that identify complementary disease-relevant perturbations for three        omics techniques: neuroimaging-based subtypes, metabolomics-derived metabolite        panels, and genomics-related polygenic risk scores. Neuroimaging can track        accrued neurodegeneration and other sources of network impairments, metabolomics        provides a global small-molecule snapshot that is sensitive to ongoing        pathological processes, and genomics characterizes relatively invariant genetic        risk factors representing key pathways associated with Alzheimer's disease.        Following this focused review, we present a roadmap for assembling these        multiomics measurements into a diagnostic tool highly predictive of individual        clinical trajectories, to further the goal of personalized medicine in        Alzheimer's disease.",PMC7241959,Brain : a journal of neurology,0372537
38673048,"Identifying Progression-Specific Alzheimer's Subtypes Using Multimodal        Transformer.",10.3390/jpm14040421,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prevalent neurodegenerative disease, yet its        current treatments are limited to stopping disease progression. Moreover, the        effectiveness of these treatments remains uncertain due to the heterogeneity of        the disease. Therefore, it is essential to identify disease subtypes at a very        early stage. Current data-driven approaches can be used to classify subtypes        during later stages of AD or related disorders, but making predictions in the        asymptomatic or prodromal stage is challenging. Furthermore, the classifications        of most existing models lack explainability, and these models rely solely on a        single modality for assessment, limiting the scope of their analysis. Thus, we        propose a multimodal framework that utilizes early-stage indicators, including        imaging, genetics, and clinical assessments, to classify AD patients into        progression-specific subtypes at an early stage. In our framework, we introduce a        tri-modal co-attention mechanism (Tri-COAT) to explicitly capture cross-modal        feature associations. Data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative        (ADNI) (slow progressing = 177, intermediate = 302, and fast = 15) were used to        train and evaluate Tri-COAT using a 10-fold stratified cross-testing approach.        Our proposed model outperforms baseline models and sheds light on essential        associations across multimodal features supported by known biological mechanisms.        The multimodal design behind Tri-COAT allows it to achieve the highest        classification area under the receiver operating characteristic curve while        simultaneously providing interpretability to the model predictions through the        co-attention mechanism.",PMC11051083,Journal of personalized medicine,101602269

Here, we leveraged publicly        available genome-wide association study data to investigate the intrinsic causal        relationship between blood BMTs, brain image-derived phenotypes (IDPs) and AD.        METHODS: Utilizing the genetic variants associated with 760 blood BMTs and 172        brain IDPs as the exposure and the latest AD summary statistics as the outcome,        we analyzed the causal relationship between blood BMTs and brain IDPs and AD by        using a two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) method. Additionally, we used        two-step/mediation MR to study the mediating effect of brain IDPs between blood        BMTs and AD. RESULTS: Twenty-five traits for genetic evidence supporting a causal        association with AD were identified, including 12 blood BMTs and 13 brain IDPs.        For BMTs, glutamine consistently reduced the risk of AD in 3 datasets. For IDPs,        specific alterations of cortical thickness (atrophy in frontal pole and insular        lobe, and incrassation in superior parietal lobe) and subcortical volume (atrophy        in hippocampus and its subgroups, left accumbens and left choroid plexus, and        expansion in cerebral white matter) are vulnerable to AD. In the        two-step/mediation MR analysis, superior parietal lobe, right hippocampal fissure        and left accumbens were identified to play a potential mediating role among three        blood BMTs and AD. CONCLUSIONS: The results obtained in our study suggest that 12        circulating BMTs and 13 brain IDPs play a causal role in AD. Importantly, a        subset of BMTs exhibit shared genetic architecture and potentially causal        relationships with brain structure, which may contribute to the alteration of        brain IDPs in AD.",PMC11033073,Heliyon,101672560

METHODS: We used an untargeted approach with liquid chromatography        coupled to high-resolution mass spectrometry to measure small molecule plasma        metabolites from 150 clinically diagnosed AD patients and 567 age-matched healthy        elderly of Caribbean Hispanic ancestry. Plasma biomarkers of AD were measured        including P-tau181, Aβ40, Aβ42, total-tau, neurofilament light chain (NfL) and        glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP). Association of individual and co-abundant        modules of metabolites were tested with clinical diagnosis of AD, as well as        biologically-defined AD pathological process based on P-tau181 and other        biomarker levels. RESULTS: Over 6000 metabolomic features were measured with high        accuracy. First principal component (PC) of lysophosphatidylcholines (lysoPC)        that bind to or interact with docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), eicosapentaenoic acid        (EPA) and arachidonic acid (AHA) was associated with decreased risk of AD (OR =        0.91 [0.89-0.96], p = 2e-04). Association was restricted to individuals without        an APOE ε4 allele (OR = 0.89 [0.84-0.94], p = 8.7e-05). Among individuals        carrying at least one APOE ε4 allele, PC4 of lysoPCs moderately increased risk of        AD (OR = 1.37 [1.16-1.6], p = 1e-04). Essential amino acids including tyrosine        metabolism pathways were enriched among metabolites associated with P-tau181        levels and heparan and keratan sulfate degradation pathways were associated with        Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio. CONCLUSIONS: Unbiased metabolic profiling can identify critical        metabolites and pathways associated with β-amyloid and phosphotau pathology.

Developing personalized diagnostic strategies for NCDs has therefore        become a priority. RESULTS: Multimodal electroencephalography (EEG) data of a        matched cohort of normal aging (NA) and NCDs seniors were recorded, and their        faecal samples and urine exosomes were collected to identify multi-omics        signatures and metabolic pathways in NCDs by integrating metagenomics,        proteomics, and metabolomics analysis. Additionally, experimental verification of        multi-omics signatures was carried out in aged mice using faecal microbiota        transplantation (FMT). We found that NCDs seniors had low EEG power spectral        density and identified specific microbiota, including Ruminococcus gnavus,        Enterocloster bolteae, Lachnoclostridium sp. YL 32, and metabolites, including        L-tryptophan, L-glutamic acid, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), and fatty acid        esters of hydroxy fatty acids (FAHFAs), as well as disturbed biosynthesis of        aromatic amino acids and TCA cycle dysfunction, validated in aged mice. Finally,        we employed a support vector machine (SVM) algorithm to construct a machine        learning model to classify NA and NCDs groups based on the fusion of EEG data and        multi-omics profiles and the model demonstrated 92.69% accuracy in classifying NA        and NCDs groups.

Current metabolic imaging studies        suffer from limitations including low resolution and specificity, and the model        systems utilized often lack human relevance. Here, we present a single-cell        metabolic imaging platform to enable direct imaging of lipid metabolism with high        specificity in various human-derived 2D and 3D culture systems. Through the        incorporation of an azide-tagged infrared probe, selective detection of newly        synthesized lipids in cells and tissue became possible, while simultaneous        fluorescence imaging enabled cell-type identification in complex tissues. In        proof-of-concept experiments, newly synthesized lipids were directly visualized        in human-relevant model systems among different cell types, mutation status,        differentiation stages, and over time.

The hallmark of AD is progressive neurodegeneration, which is        characterized by the deepening loss of memory and a high mortality rate in the        elderly. The neurodegeneration in AD is believed to be exacerbated following the        intercoupled cascades of extracellular amyloid beta (Aβ) plaques, uncontrolled        microglial activation, and neuroinflammation. Current therapies for AD are mostly        designed to target the symptoms, with limited ability to address the mechanistic        triggers for the disease. In this study, we report a novel nanotechnology based        on microglial scavenger receptor (SR)-targeting amphiphilic nanoparticles (NPs)        for the convergent alleviation of fibril Aβ (fAβ) burden, microglial modulation,        and neuroprotection. METHODS: We designed a nanotechnology approach to regulate        the SR-mediated intracellular fAβ trafficking within microglia. We synthesized        SR-targeting sugar-based amphiphilic macromolecules (AM) and used them as a        bioactive shell to fabricate serum-stable AM-NPs via flash nanoprecipitation.        Using electron microscopy, in vitro approaches, ELISA, and confocal microscopy,        we investigated the effect of AM-NPs on Aβ fibrilization, fAβ-mediated microglial        inflammation, and neurotoxicity in BV2 microglia and SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cell        lines. RESULTS: AM-NPs interrupted Aβ fibrilization, attenuated fAβ microglial        internalization via targeting the fAβ-specific SRs, arrested the fAβ-mediated        microglial activation and pro-inflammatory response, and accelerated lysosomal        degradation of intracellular fAβ. Moreover, AM-NPs counteracted the        microglial-mediated neurotoxicity after exposure to fAβ.

This study is the first        to evaluate which, among these multiple frailty-related indicators, are important        and differential predictors of clinical cohorts that represent progression along        an Alzheimer's disease (AD) spectrum. We applied machine-learning technology to        such indicators in order to identify the leading predictors of three AD spectrum        cohorts; viz., subjective cognitive impairment (SCI), mild cognitive impairment        (MCI), and AD. The common benchmark was a cohort of cognitively unimpaired (CU)        older adults. METHODS: The four cohorts were from the cross-sectional        Comprehensive Assessment of Neurodegeneration and Dementia dataset. We used        random forest analysis (Python 3.7) to simultaneously test the relative        importance of 83 multi-modal frailty indicators in discriminating the cohorts. We        performed an explainable artificial intelligence method (Tree Shapley Additive        exPlanation values) for deep interpretation of prediction effects. RESULTS: We        observed strong concurrent prediction results, with clusters varying across        cohorts. The SCI model demonstrated excellent prediction accuracy (AUC = 0.89).        Three leading predictors were poorer quality of life ([QoL]; memory), abnormal        lymphocyte count, and abnormal neutrophil count. The MCI model demonstrated a        similarly high AUC (0.88). Five leading predictors were poorer QoL (memory,        leisure), male sex, abnormal lymphocyte count, and poorer self-rated eyesight.        The AD model demonstrated outstanding prediction accuracy (AUC = 0.98). Ten        leading predictors were poorer QoL (memory), reduced olfaction, male sex,        increased dependence in activities of daily living (n = 6), and poorer visual        contrast. CONCLUSIONS: Both convergent and cohort-specific frailty factors        discriminated the AD spectrum cohorts. Convergence was observed as all cohorts        were marked by lower quality of life (memory), supporting recent research and        clinical attention to subjective experiences of memory aging and their        potentially broad ramifications. Diversity was displayed in that, of the 14        leading predictors extracted across models, 11 were selectively sensitive to one        cohort. A morbidity intensity trend was indicated by an increasing number and        diversity of predictors corresponding to clinical severity, especially in AD.        Knowledge of differential deficit predictors across AD clinical cohorts may        promote precision interventions.",PMC10714519,BMC geriatrics,100968548

Jia-Wei-Kai-Xin-San (JWKXS) is applied        for treating AD with MCI. However, the mechanism of JWKXS in the treatment of MCI        is unclear. Thus, this study aimed to investigate the effect and mechanism of        JWKXS in SAMP8 mice models of MCI. METHODS: MCI models were established to        examine learning and memory ability and explore the pathomechanisms in brain of        SAMP8 mice at 4, 6, and 8 months. The mice were treated for 8 weeks and the        effects of JWKXS on MCI were characterized through Morris water maze and        HE/Nissl's/immunohistochemical staining. Its mechanism was predicted by the        combination of UPLC-Q-TOF/MS and system pharmacology analysis, further verified        with SAMP8 mice, BV2 microglial cells, and PC12 cells. RESULTS: It was found that        4-month-old SAMP8 mice exhibited MCI. Two months of JWKXS treatment improved the        learning and memory ability, alleviated the hippocampal tissue and neuron damage.        Through network pharmacology, four key signaling pathways were found to be        involved in treatment of MCI by JWKXS, including TLR4/NF-κB pathway, NLRP3        inflammasome activation, and intrinsic and extrinsic apoptosis. In vitro and in        vivo experiments demonstrated that JWKXS attenuated neuroinflammation by        inhibiting microglia activation, suppressing TLR4/NF-κB and NLRP3 inflammasome        pathways, and blocking the extrinsic and intrinsic apoptotic pathways leading to        neuronal apoptosis suppression in the hippocampus.

The objective of this work was to investigate fluid-attenuated inversion        recovery (FLAIR) MRI biomarkers and their ability to differentiate between sMCI        and cMCI subjects in cross-sectional and longitudinal data. Three types of        biomarkers were investigated: volume, intensity and texture. Volume biomarkers        included total brain volume, cerebrospinal fluid volume (CSF), lateral        ventricular volume, white matter lesion volume, subarachnoid CSF, and grey matter        (GM) and white matter (WM), all normalized to intracranial volume. The mean        intensity, kurtosis, and skewness of the GM and WM made up the intensity        features. Texture features quantified homogeneity and microstructural tissue        changes of GM and WM regions. Composite indices were also considered, which are        biomarkers that represent an aggregate sum (z-score normalization and summation)        of all biomarkers. The FLAIR MRI biomarkers successfully identified high-risk        subjects as significant differences (p < 0.05) were found between the means of        the sMCI and cMCI groups and the rate of change over time for several individual        biomarkers as well as the composite indices for both cross-sectional and        longitudinal analyses. Classification accuracy and feature importance analysis        showed volume biomarkers to be most predictive, however, best performance was        obtained when complimenting the volume biomarkers with the intensity and texture        features. Using all the biomarkers, accuracy of 86.2 % and 69.2 % was achieved        for normal control-AD and sMCI-cMCI classification respectively. Survival        analysis demonstrated that the majority of the biomarkers showed a noticeable        impact on the AD conversion probability 4 years prior to conversion. Composite        indices were the top performers for all analyses including feature importance,        classification, and survival analysis.

Significant        correlation (p < 0.05) with phosphorylated-tau and amyloid-beta CSF biomarkers        was found with all the FLAIR biomarkers.

In particular, the cohort included 92 patients with AD, 126 normal        controls (NC) and 214 subjects with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). We show how        graph theory-based models can accurately distinguish these clinical conditions        and how Shapley values, borrowed from game theory, can be adopted to make these        models intelligible and easy to interpret. Explainability analyses outline the        role played by regions like putamen, middle and superior temporal gyrus; from a        class-related perspective, it is possible to outline specific regions, such as        hippocampus and amygdala for AD and posterior cingulate and precuneus for MCI.        The approach is general and could be adopted to outline how brain connectivity        affects specific brain regions.",PMC10501457,Frontiers in aging neuroscience,101525824

METHODS: We used an        untargeted approach with liquid chromatography coupled to high-resolution mass        spectrometry to measure exogenous and endogenous small molecule metabolites in        plasma from 150 individuals clinically diagnosed with AD and 567 age-matched        elderly without dementia of Caribbean Hispanic ancestry. Plasma biomarkers of AD        were also measured including P-tau181, Aβ40, Aβ42, total tau, neurofilament light        chain (NfL) and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP). Association of individual        and co-expressed modules of metabolites were tested with the clinical diagnosis        of AD, as well as biologically-defined AD pathological process based on P-tau181        and other biomarker levels. RESULTS: Over 4000 metabolomic features were measured        with high accuracy. First principal component (PC) of lysophosphatidylcholines        (lysoPC) that bind to or interact with docosahexaenoic acid (DHA),        eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and arachidonic acid (AHA) was associated with        decreased risk of AD (OR=0.91 [0.89-0.96], p=2e-04). Restricted to individuals        without an APOE ε4 allele (OR=0.89 [0.84-0.94], p= 8.7e-05), the association        remained. Among individuals carrying at least one APOE ε4 allele, PC4 of lysoPCs        moderately increased risk of AD (OR=1.37 [1.16-1.6], p=1e-04).

METHOD: Participants were 48 well-characterized PD patients (M(baseline        age) = 71.6; SD = 4.8; 44% female). We tested 38 multi-modal predictors from 10        domains (e.g., motor, cognitive) in a computationally competitive context to        identify those that best discriminated two unobserved baseline groups, PD No        Dementia (PDND), and PD Incipient Dementia (PDID). We used Random Forest (RF)        classifier models for the discrimination goal and Tree SHapley Additive        exPlanation (Tree SHAP) values for deep interpretation. RESULTS: An excellent RF        model discriminated baseline PDID from PDND (AUC = 0.84; normalized Matthews        Correlation Coefficient = 0.76). Tree SHAP showed that ten leading predictors of        PDID accounted for 62.5% of the model, as well as their relative importance,        direction, and magnitude (risk threshold). These predictors represented the motor        (e.g., poorer gait), cognitive (e.g., slower Trail A), molecular (up-regulated        metabolite panel), demographic (age), imaging (ventricular volume), and lifestyle        (activities of daily living) domains.

METHODS: Genes associated with        subarachnoid hemorrhage and CV were acquired and screened for differentially        expressed miRNAs (DEmiRNAs) associated with aneurysm rupture. A regulatory        network of DEmiRNAs and mRNAs was constructed, and virtual screening was        performed to evaluate possible binding patterns between Food and Drug        Administration (FDA)-approved drugs and core proteins.

Thirty-five days after        Aβ(1-42) induction, rats displayed significant cognitive deficits, and forty        metabolites were changed, of which twenty belonged to three perturbed pathways:        (1) phenylalanine metabolism and phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan        biosynthesis-L-phenylalanine, phenylpyruvate, ortho-hydroxyphenylacetic acid, and        phenyllactic acid are up-regulated; (2) arachidonic acid (ARA)        metabolism-leukotriene B4 (LTB4), arachidonyl carnitine, and 5(S)-HPETE are        upregulation, but ARA, 14,15-DiHETrE, 5(S)-HETE, and PGB2 are opposite; and (3)        unsaturated fatty acid biosynthesis- eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), docosahexaenoic        acid (DHA), FA 18:3 + 1O, and FA 18:3 + 2O are downregulated.

However,        existing subtyping studies have mostly focused on single data modalities and only        those individuals with severe cognitive impairment. To address these gaps, we        applied similarity network fusion, a method capable of integrating multiple        high-dimensional multi-omic data modalities simultaneously, to an elderly sample        spanning the full spectrum of cognitive ageing trajectories. We analyzed human        frontal cortex brain samples characterized by five omic modalities: bulk RNA        sequencing (18 629 genes), DNA methylation (53 932 CpG sites), histone        acetylation (26 384 peaks), proteomics (7737 proteins) and metabolomics (654        metabolites). Similarity network fusion followed by spectral clustering was used        for subtype detection, and subtype numbers were determined by Eigen-gap and        rotation cost statistics. Normalized mutual information determined the relative        contribution of each modality to the fused network. Subtypes were characterized        by associations with 13 age-related neuropathologies and cognitive decline.        Fusion of all five data modalities (n = 111) yielded two subtypes (n (S1) = 53, n        (S2) = 58), which were nominally associated with diffuse amyloid plaques;        however, this effect was not significant after correction for multiple testing.        Histone acetylation (normalized mutual information = 0.38), DNA methylation        (normalized mutual information = 0.18) and RNA abundance (normalized mutual        information = 0.15) contributed most strongly to this network. Secondary analysis        integrating only these three modalities in a larger subsample (n = 513) indicated        support for both three- and five-subtype solutions, which had significant        overlap, but showed varying degrees of internal stability and external validity.        One subtype showed marked cognitive decline, which remained significant even        after correcting for tests across both three- and five-subtype solutions (p        (Bonf) = 5.9 × 10(-3)). Comparison to single-modality subtypes demonstrated that        the three-modal subtypes were able to uniquely capture cognitive variability.        Comprehensive sensitivity analyses explored influences of sample size and cluster        number parameters. We identified highly integrative molecular subtypes of ageing        derived from multiple high dimensional, multi-omic data modalities        simultaneously.

METHODS: Our sample        was drawn from a repository of social media posts extracted from 112 public        sources between January 1998 and December 2021 using natural language processing        text-mining algorithms. The patient journey was classified into three phases: (1)        early signs/experiences (Early Signs); (2) screening/assessment/diagnosis        (Screening); and (3) treatment/management (Treatment). In the Early Signs phase,        issues/challenges derived from a conceptual AD identification framework (ADIF)        were examined. In subsequent phases, behavioral/psychiatric challenges,        access/barriers to health care, screening/diagnostic methods, and symptomatic        treatments for AD were identified. Posts were classified by AD stakeholder type        or disease stage, if possible. RESULTS: We identified 225,977 AD patient        journey-related social media posts. Anxiety was a predominant issue/challenge in        all patient journey phases. In the Screening and Treatment phases combined,        access/barriers to care were described in 16% of posts; unwillingness/resistance        to seeking care was a major barrier (≥ 75% of access-related posts across all        stakeholders). Commonly identified structural barriers (e.g., affordability/cost,        geography/transportation/distance) were more common in patient/caregiver posts        than clinician posts. Among Screening-related posts, imaging/scans were commonly        mentioned by all stakeholders; biomarkers were more commonly mentioned by        patients than clinicians. Treatment-related concerns were identified in 17% of        stakeholder-specified posts that named pharmacological agents/classes for the        symptomatic management of AD. CONCLUSION: This descriptive analysis of        out-of-clinic experiences reflected in AD social media posts found that        unwillingness/resistance to seeking care was a key barrier, followed by        structural barriers to health care, such as affordability/cost.

Metabolite signatures that have close proximity to subject's phenotypic        informative dimension, are useful for predicting diagnosis and prognosis of        diseases as well as monitoring treatments. The lack of early biomarkers could        lead to poor diagnosis and serious outcomes. Therefore, noninvasive diagnosis and        monitoring methods with high specificity and selectivity are desperately needed.        Small molecule metabolites-based metabolomics has become a specialized tool for        metabolic biomarker and pathway analysis, for revealing possible mechanisms of        human various diseases and deciphering therapeutic potentials.

Understanding the exact        neurobiological mechanisms underlying AD pathology may help to provide a        biomarker for early diagnosis or at least for assessment of vulnerability to        dementia development. Neural plasticity is defined as a capability of the brain        to respond to alterations including aging, injury, or learning, with a crucial        role of synaptic elements. Long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression        (LTD) are important in regulating synaptic connections between neural cells in        functional plasticity. Synaptic loss and impairment of the brain's plasticity in        AD leads to cognitive impairment, and one of important roles of synaptic        biomarkers is monitoring synaptic dysfunction, response to treatment, and        predicting future development of AD.

However, it is        still challenging to integrate omics data from different modalities. Here, we        propose a variation of the Siamese neural network framework called MinNet, which        is trained to integrate multi-omics data on the single-cell resolution by using        graph-based contrastive loss. RESULTS: By training the model and testing it on        several benchmark datasets, we showed its accuracy and generalizability in        integrating scRNA-seq with scATAC-seq, and scRNA-seq with epitope data. Further        evaluation demonstrated our model's unique ability to remove the batch effect, a        common problem in actual practice.

Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)        images were obtained from patients with AD and MCI and matched healthy controls        (HCs). One-way ANCOVA was used to investigate (global, long-range, and local) FCD        differences among the three groups followed by post-hoc analysis controlling age,        sex, and head motion.

This inconsistency is present among        molecular subtypes, which has led to diagnostic ambiguity and failure in drug        development. We precisely distinguished patients of AD at the transcriptome        level. METHODS: We collected 1,240 AD brain tissue samples collected from the GEO        dataset. Consensus clustering was used to identify molecular subtypes, and the        clinical characteristics were focused on. To reveal transcriptome differences        among subgroups, we certificated specific upregulated genes and annotated the        biological function. According to RANK METRIC SCORE in GSEA, TOP10 was defined as        the hub gene. In addition, the systematic correlation between the hub gene and        ""A/T/N"" was analyzed. Finally, we used external data sets to verify the        diagnostic value of hub genes. RESULTS: We identified three molecular subtypes of        AD from 743 AD samples, among which subtypes I and III had high-risk factors, and        subtype II had protective factors. All three subgroups had higher neuritis plaque        density, and subgroups I and III had higher clinical dementia scores and        neurofibrillary tangles than subgroup II. Our results confirmed a positive        association between neurofibrillary tangles and dementia, but not neuritis        plaques. Subgroup I genes clustered in viral infection, hypoxia injury, and        angiogenesis. Subgroup II showed heterogeneity in synaptic pathology, and we        found several essential beneficial synaptic proteins. Due to presenilin one        amplification, Subgroup III was a risk subgroup suspected of familial AD,        involving abnormal neurogenic signals, glial cell differentiation, and        proliferation.

At least twice as many have been        infected but remained asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic. COVID-19 includes        central nervous system manifestations mediated by inflammation and        cerebrovascular, anoxic, and/or viral neurotoxicity mechanisms. More than one        third of patients with COVID-19 develop neurologic problems during the acute        phase of the illness, including loss of sense of smell or taste, seizures, and        stroke. Damage or functional changes to the brain may result in chronic sequelae.        The risk of incident cognitive and neuropsychiatric complications appears        independent from the severity of the original pulmonary illness. It behooves the        scientific and medical community to attempt to understand the molecular and/or        systemic factors linking COVID-19 to neurologic illness, both short and long        term. METHODS: This article describes what is known so far in terms of links        among COVID-19, the brain, neurological symptoms, and Alzheimer's disease (AD)        and related dementias. We focus on risk factors and possible molecular,        inflammatory, and viral mechanisms underlying neurological injury. We also        provide a comprehensive description of the Alzheimer's Association Consortium on        Chronic Neuropsychiatric Sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (CNS SC2) harmonized        methodology to address these questions using a worldwide network of researchers        and institutions. RESULTS: Successful harmonization of designs and methods was        achieved through a consensus process initially fragmented by specific interest        groups (epidemiology, clinical assessments, cognitive evaluation, biomarkers, and        neuroimaging). Conclusions from subcommittees were presented to the whole group        and discussed extensively. Presently data collection is ongoing at 19 sites in 12        countries representing Asia, Africa, the Americas, and Europe. DISCUSSION: The        Alzheimer's Association Global Consortium harmonized methodology is proposed as a        model to study long-term neurocognitive sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection. KEY        POINTS: The following review describes what is known so far in terms of molecular        and epidemiological links among COVID-19, the brain, neurological symptoms, and        AD and related dementias (ADRD)The primary objective of this large-scale        collaboration is to clarify the pathogenesis of ADRD and to advance our        understanding of the impact of a neurotropic virus on the long-term risk of        cognitive decline and other CNS sequelae. No available evidence supports the        notion that cognitive impairment after SARS-CoV-2 infection is a form of dementia        (ADRD or otherwise). The longitudinal methodologies espoused by the consortium        are intended to provide data to answer this question as clearly as possible        controlling for possible confounders. Our specific hypothesis is that SARS-CoV-2        triggers ADRD-like pathology following the extended olfactory cortical network        (EOCN) in older individuals with specific genetic susceptibility.The proposed        harmonization strategies and flexible study designs offer the possibility to        include large samples of under-represented racial and ethnic groups, creating a        rich set of harmonized cohorts for future studies of the pathophysiology,        determinants, long-term consequences, and trends in cognitive aging, ADRD, and        vascular disease.We provide a framework for current and future studies to be        carried out within the Consortium. and offers a ""green paper"" to the research        community with a very broad, global base of support, on tools suitable for low-        and middle-income countries aimed to compare and combine future longitudinal data        on the topic.The Consortium proposes a combination of design and statistical        methods as a means of approaching causal inference of the COVID-19        neuropsychiatric sequelae. We expect that deep phenotyping of neuropsychiatric        sequelae may provide a series of candidate syndromes with phenomenological and        biological characterization that can be further explored.

One application is to discover disease subtypes        using unsupervised clustering. However, existing clustering methods are often        applied to input features directly, and could suffer from the curse of        dimensionality with high-dimensional multimodal data. The purpose of our study is        to identify multimodal imaging-driven subtypes in Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI)        participants using a multiview learning framework based on Deep Generalized        Canonical Correlation Analysis (DGCCA), to learn shared latent representation        with low dimensions from 3 neuroimaging modalities. RESULTS: DGCCA applies        non-linear transformation to input views using neural networks and is able to        learn correlated embeddings with low dimensions that capture more variance than        its linear counterpart, generalized CCA (GCCA). We designed experiments to        compare DGCCA embeddings with single modality features and GCCA embeddings by        generating 2 subtypes from each feature set using unsupervised clustering. In our        validation studies, we found that amyloid PET imaging has the most discriminative        features compared with structural MRI and FDG PET which DGCCA learns from but not        GCCA. DGCCA subtypes show differential measures in 5 cognitive assessments, 6        brain volume measures, and conversion to AD patterns. In addition, DGCCA MCI        subtypes confirmed AD genetic markers with strong signals that existing late MCI        group did not identify. CONCLUSION: Overall, DGCCA is able to learn effective low        dimensional embeddings from multimodal data by learning non-linear projections.        MCI subtypes generated from DGCCA embeddings are different from existing early        and late MCI groups and show most similarity with those identified by amyloid PET        features. In our validation studies, DGCCA subtypes show distinct patterns in        cognitive measures, brain volumes, and are able to identify AD genetic markers.        These findings indicate the promise of the imaging-driven subtypes and their        power in revealing disease structures beyond early and late stage MCI.",PMC9523890,BMC bioinformatics,100965194

RESULTS: Meta-analyses indicated        that higher circulating GFAP associated with lower general cognition (ß = -0.09,        [95% confidence interval [CI]: -0.15 to -0.03], p = 0.005), but not with total        brain or hippocampal volume (p &gt; 0.05). However, each standard deviation unit        increase in log-transformed GFAP levels was significantly associated with a        2.5-fold higher risk of incident all-cause dementia (Hazard Ratio [HR]: 2.47 (95%        CI: 1.52-4.01)) and Alzheimer's disease dementia (HR: 2.54 [95% CI: 1.42-4.53])        over up to 15-years of follow-up.

A total of 49 biomarkers associated with the AD        model were identified by metabolomics, and pathway analysis was performed to        obtain the metabolic pathways closely related to the model. With the        pre-treatment of AR, 32 metabolites in the serum of AD model rats were        significantly affected by AR compared with the AD model group. The regulated        metabolites affected by AR were involved in the pathway of arginine biosynthesis,        arginine and proline metabolism, ether lipid metabolism, glutathione metabolism,        primary bile acid biosynthesis, and steroid biosynthesis. These multi-platform        metabolomics analyses were in accord with the results of behavior study,        histopathological observations, and biochemical analyses.

Biomarkers may be used in clinical care or as drug development        tools (DDTs) in clinical trials. The goal of this review and perspective is to        provide insight into the regulatory guidance for the use of biomarkers in        clinical trials and clinical care. Materials and Methods: We reviewed FDA        guidances relevant to biomarker use in clinical trials and their transition to        use in clinical care. We identified instructive examples of these biomarkers in        Alzheimer's disease (AD) drug development and their application in clinical        practice. Results: For use in clinical trials, biomarkers must have a defined        context of use (COU) as a risk/susceptibility, diagnostic, monitoring,        predictive, prognostic, pharmacodynamic, or safety biomarker. A four-stage        process defines the pathway to establish the regulatory acceptance of the COU for        a biomarker including submission of a letter of intent, description of the        qualification plan, submission of a full qualification package, and acceptance        through a qualification recommendation.

In this study, we used these datasets to investigate brain        region-specific molecular pathways underlying ad pathogenesis and explore their        potential drug targets. We applied our new network-based tool, Edge-Weighted        Dense Module Search of GWAS (EW_dmGWAS), to integrate ad GWAS statistics of        472 868 individuals with proteomic profiles from two brain regions from two        large-scale ad cohorts [parahippocampal gyrus (PHG), sample size n = 190;        dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), n = 192].

Although distributions of        hippocampal volume trajectories for asymptomatic individuals often reveal        substantial heterogeneity, it is unclear whether interpretable trajectory classes        can be objectively detected and used for prediction analyses. OBJECTIVE: To        detect and predict hippocampal trajectory classes in a computationally        competitive context using established AD-related risk factors/biomarkers.        METHODS: We used biomarker/risk factor and longitudinal MRI data in asymptomatic        adults from the AD Neuroimaging Initiative (n = 351; Mean = 75 years; 48.7%        female). First, we applied latent class growth analyses to left (LHC) and right        (RHC) hippocampal trajectory distributions to identify distinct classes. Second,        using random forest analyses, we tested 38 multi-modal biomarkers/risk factors        for their relative importance in discriminating the lower (potentially elevated        atrophy risk) from the higher (potentially reduced risk) class. RESULTS: For both        LHC and RHC trajectory distribution analyses, we observed three distinct        trajectory classes. Three biomarkers/risk factors predicted membership in LHC and        RHC lower classes: male sex, higher education, and lower plasma Aβ1-42. Four        additional factors selectively predicted membership in the lower LHC class: lower        plasma tau and Aβ1-40, higher depressive symptomology, and lower body mass index.        CONCLUSION: Data-driven analyses of LHC and RHC trajectories detected three        classes underlying the heterogeneous distributions. Machine learning analyses        determined three common and four unique biomarkers/risk factors discriminating        the higher and lower LHC/RHC classes.

Methods: We        collected genome-wide sequences and utterances edited from clinical interview        speech records from 3,580 women with recurrent MDD and 4,016 healthy people.        Then, we constructed PRS as a gene biomarker by p value-based clumping and        thresholding and extracted voice features using the i-vector method. Using        logistic regression, we compared the ability of gene or voice biomarkers with the        ability of both in combination for MDD detection. We also tested more machine        learning models to further improve the detection capability. Results: With a        p-value threshold of 0.005, the combined biomarker improved the area under the        receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) by 9.09% compared to that of genes        only and 6.73% compared to that of voice only.

RESULTS: The hAPP695SW transgene        causes overproduction and accumulation of Aβ in the brain. Out of 180 annotated        metabolites, 54 metabolites differed (30 higher and 24 lower in Tg2576 versus        wild-type hippocampal tissue) and were linked to the amino acid, nucleic acid,        glycerophospholipid, ceramide, and fatty acid metabolism.

RESULTS: Alzheimer's disease (AD; n = 139) and        behavioral variant frontotemporal (bvFTD; n = 58) were the most common causes        with a mean age of onset of 56.5 years for AD (±1 SD 5.45) and 57.1 years for        bvFTD (±1 SD 5.66). Neuropathology showed a variety of diagnoses from multiple        sclerosis, Lewy body disease, FTD-MND, TDP-43 proteinopathy, adult-onset        leukoencephalopathy with axonal steroids and pigmented glia, corticobasal        degeneration, unexplained small vessel disease, and autoimmune T-cell        encephalitis. Non-amnestic forms of AD and alternative forms of FTD were        discovered. Mutations were only found in 11 subjects (11/240 = 4.6%). APOE        genotyping was not divergent between the two populations. CONCLUSION: There are        multiple kinds of YOD, and most are sporadic. These observations point to their        stochastic origins.",PMC8461730,Journal of Alzheimer's disease reports,101705500

We test such a network in a series of three        analytic steps. First, we test independent associations between three risk scores        (functional-health, lifestyle-reserve, and a combined multimodal risk score) and        cognitive [executive function (EF)] trajectories. Second, we test whether all        three associations are moderated by the most penetrant AD genetic risk        [Apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε4+ allele]. Third, we test whether a non-APOE AD        genetic risk score further moderates these APOE × multimodal risk score        associations. Methods: We assembled a longitudinal data set (spanning a 40-year        band of aging, 53-95 years) with non-demented older adults (baseline n = 602;        Mage = 70.63(8.70) years; 66% female) from the Victoria Longitudinal Study (VLS).        The measures included for each modifiable risk score were: (1) functional-health        [pulse pressure (PP), grip strength, and body mass index], (2) lifestyle-reserve        (physical, social, cognitive-integrative, cognitive-novel activities, and        education), and (3) the combination of functional-health and lifestyle-reserve        risk scores. Two AD genetic risk markers included (1) APOE and (2) a combined        AD-genetic risk score (AD-GRS) comprised of three single nucleotide polymorphisms        (SNPs; Clusterin[rs11136000], Complement receptor 1[rs6656401],        Phosphatidylinositol binding clathrin assembly protein[rs3851179]). The analytics        included confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), longitudinal invariance testing, and        latent growth curve modeling. Structural path analyses were deployed to test and        compare prediction models for EF performance and change. Results: First, separate        analyses showed that higher functional-health risk scores, lifestyle-reserve risk        scores, and the combined score, predicted poorer EF performance and steeper        decline. Second, APOE and AD-GRS moderated the association between        functional-health risk score and the combined risk score, on EF performance and        change. Specifically, only older adults in the APOEε4- group showed steeper EF        decline with high risk scores on both functional-health and combined risk score.        Both associations were further magnified for adults with high AD-GRS. Conclusion:        The present multimodal AD risk network approach incorporated both modifiable and        genetic risk scores to predict EF trajectories. The results add an additional        degree of precision to risk profile calculations for asymptomatic aging        populations.",PMC8482841,Frontiers in aging neuroscience,101525824

OBJECTIVE: We examined age as a moderator of outcome in        an exploratory study of deep brain stimulation targeting the fornix (DBS-f)        region in participants with AD. METHODS: Forty-two participants were implanted        with DBS electrodes and randomized to double-blind DBS-f stimulation (""on"") or        sham DBS-f (""off"") for 12 months. RESULTS: The intervention was safe and well        tolerated.

There was a        significant age by time interaction with the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment        Scale; ADAS-cog-13 (p = 0.028). Six of the 12 enrolled participants < 65 years        old (50%) markedly declined on the ADAS-cog-13 versus only 6.7%of the 30        participants≥65 years old regardless of treatment assignment (p = 0.005).

This heterogeneity makes        difficult the development of early diagnosis and effective treatment approaches,        as well as the design and testing of new drugs. As such, the stratification of        patients into meaningful disease subgroups, with clinical and biological        relevance, may improve disease management and the development of effective        treatments. To this end, omics technologies-such as genomics, transcriptomics,        proteomics and metabolomics-are contributing to offer a more comprehensive view        of molecular pathways underlying the development of NDs, helping to differentiate        subtypes of patients based on their specific molecular signatures.

However,        the most common statistical designs used in dementia research studies and        clinical trials overlook this heterogeneity, instead relying on comparisons of        group average differences (e.g. patient versus control or treatment versus        placebo), implicitly assuming within-group homogeneity. This one-size-fits-all        approach potentially limits our understanding of dementia aetiology, hindering        the identification of effective treatments. Neuroimaging has enabled the        characterization of the average neuroanatomical substrates of dementias; however,        the increasing availability of large open neuroimaging datasets provides the        opportunity to examine patterns of neuroanatomical variability in individual        patients.

Their inter-individual variations, complex        interrelations, and relevance for clinical manifestation and disease progression        remain poorly understood. We hypothesize that specific molecular patterns        indicating both known and yet unidentified pathway alterations are associated        with distinct aspects of AD pathology. METHODS: We performed multi-level        cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) omics in a well-characterized cohort of older adults        with normal cognition, mild cognitive impairment, and mild dementia. Proteomics,        metabolomics, lipidomics, one-carbon metabolism, and neuroinflammation related        molecules were analyzed at single-omic level with correlation and regression        approaches. Multi-omics factor analysis was used to integrate all biological        levels. Identified analytes were used to construct best predictive models of the        presence of AD pathology and of cognitive decline with multifactorial regression        analysis. Pathway enrichment analysis identified pathway alterations in AD.        RESULTS: Multi-omics integration identified five major dimensions of        heterogeneity explaining the variance within the cohort and differentially        associated with AD. Further analysis exposed multiple interactions between single        'omics modalities and distinct multi-omics molecular signatures differentially        related to amyloid pathology, neuronal injury, and tau hyperphosphorylation.        Enrichment pathway analysis revealed overrepresentation of the hemostasis, immune        response, and extracellular matrix signaling pathways in association with AD.        Finally, combinations of four molecules improved prediction of both AD (protein        14-3-3 zeta/delta, clusterin, interleukin-15, and transgelin-2) and cognitive        decline (protein 14-3-3 zeta/delta, clusterin, cholesteryl ester 27:1 16:0 and        monocyte chemoattractant protein-1).

To date, no clinical test can        reliably diagnose the subtype. We established two procedures for the antemortem        diagnosis of sCJD subtype using diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).        METHODS: MRI of 1,458 patients referred to the National Prion Disease Pathology        Surveillance Center were collected through its consultation service. One        neuroradiologist blind to the diagnosis scored 12 brain regions and generated a        lesion profile for each MRI scan. We selected 487 patients with autopsy-confirmed        diagnosis of ""pure"" sCJD subtype and at least one positive diffusion MRI        examination. We designed and tested two data-driven procedures for subtype        diagnosis: the first procedure-prion subtype classification algorithm with MRI        (PriSCA_MRI)-uses only MRI examinations; the second-PriSCA_MRI + Gen-includes        knowledge of the prion protein codon 129 genotype, a major determinant of sCJD        subtypes. Both procedures were tested on the first MRI and the last MRI        follow-up. RESULTS: PriSCA_MRI classified the 3 most prevalent subtypes with 82%        accuracy. PriSCA_MRI + Gen raised the accuracy to 89% and identified all        subtypes. Individually, the 2 most prevalent sCJD subtypes, MM1 and VV2, were        diagnosed with sensitivities up to 95 and 97%, respectively. The performances of        both procedures did not change in 168 patients with longitudinal MRI studies when        the last examination was used. INTERPRETATION: This study provides the first        practical algorithms for antemortem diagnosis of sCJD subtypes. MRI diagnosis of        subtype is likely to be attainable at early disease stages to prognosticate        clinical course and design future therapeutic trials.

RESULTS: We summarize methods used for BEV        isolation, validation, and novel biomarker discovery, as well as provide insights        from 26 studies in humans on the biomarker potential in AD of four cell-specific        BEVs isolated from blood: neuron-, neural precursor-, astrocyte-, and brain        vasculature-derived BEVs.
