10.1186/s40246-023-00522-3,The application of long-read sequencing in clinical settings.,2023.0,"Long-read DNA sequencing technologies have been rapidly evolving in recent years,        and their ability to assess large and complex regions of the genome makes them        ideal for clinical applications in molecular diagnosis and therapy selection,        thereby providing a valuable tool for precision medicine. In the third-generation        sequencing duopoly, Oxford Nanopore Technologies and Pacific Biosciences work        towards increasing the accuracy, throughput, and portability of long-read        sequencing methods while trying to keep costs low. These trades have made        long-read sequencing an attractive tool for use in research and clinical        settings. This article provides an overview of current clinical applications and        limitations of long-read sequencing and explores its potential for point-of-care        testing and health care in remote settings.",bd7bce6ac08891611250c7971aacd87815c88c41,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/bd7bce6ac08891611250c7971aacd87815c88c41,37553611,PMC10410870,background,False,Human genomics,101202210,0.6956482529640198,0.056179775280898875,16,6.481,0.7236180904522613,0.7135678391959799,0.44674427544880163
10.1128/AEM.00626-21,Perspectives and Benefits of High-Throughput Long-Read Sequencing in Microbial        Ecology.,2021.0,"Short-read, high-throughput sequencing (HTS) methods have yielded numerous        important insights into microbial ecology and function. Yet, in many instances        short-read HTS techniques are suboptimal, for example, by providing insufficient        phylogenetic resolution or low integrity of assembled genomes. Single-molecule        and synthetic long-read (SLR) HTS methods have successfully ameliorated these        limitations. In addition, nanopore sequencing has generated a number of unique        analysis opportunities, such as rapid molecular diagnostics and direct RNA        sequencing, and both Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) and nanopore sequencing support        detection of epigenetic modifications. Although initially suffering from        relatively low sequence quality, recent advances have greatly improved the        accuracy of long-read sequencing technologies. In spite of great technological        progress in recent years, the long-read HTS methods (PacBio and nanopore        sequencing) are still relatively costly, require large amounts of high-quality        starting material, and commonly need specific solutions in various analysis        steps. Despite these challenges, long-read sequencing technologies offer        high-quality, cutting-edge alternatives for testing hypotheses about microbiome        structure and functioning as well as assembly of eukaryote genomes from complex        environmental DNA samples.",9b17621b186b33ff6d000d446435de66a5edd322,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/9b17621b186b33ff6d000d446435de66a5edd322,34132589,PMC8357291,background,False,Applied and environmental microbiology,7605801,0.6827852725982666,0.10588235294117647,73,5.005,0.9346733668341709,0.5276381909547738,0.46653525662429224
10.1002/humu.24465,Long-read sequencing for molecular diagnostics in constitutional genetic        disorders.,2022.0,"Long-read sequencing (LRS) has been around for more than a decade, but widespread        adoption of the technology has been slow due to the perceived high error rates        and high sequencing cost. This is changing due to the recent advancements to        produce highly accurate sequences and the reducing costs. LRS promises        significant improvement over short read sequencing in four major areas: (1)        better detection of structural variation (2) better resolution of highly        repetitive or nonunique regions (3) accurate long-range haplotype phasing and (4)        the detection of base modifications natively from the sequencing data. Several        successful applications of LRS have demonstrated its ability to resolve molecular        diagnoses where short-read sequencing fails to identify a cause. However, the        argument for increased diagnostic yield from LRS remains to be validated. Larger        cohort studies may be required to establish the realistic boundaries of LRS's        clinical utility and analytical validity, as well as the development of standards        for clinical applications. We discuss the limitations of the current standard of        care, and contrast with the applications and advantages of two major LRS        platforms, PacBio and Oxford Nanopore, for molecular diagnostics of        constitutional disorders, and present a critical argument about the potential of        LRS in diagnostic settings.",8eb16c3f0ff6cce26c58e1072a108935fcf7f8ed,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/8eb16c3f0ff6cce26c58e1072a108935fcf7f8ed,36086952,PMC9561063,,False,Human mutation,9215429,0.648800253868103,0.0625,13,4.7,0.678391959798995,0.40703517587939697,0.38245414651218973
10.1093/g3journal/jkab083,Comparison of long-read sequencing technologies in interrogating bacteria and fly        genomes.,2021.0,"The newest generation of DNA sequencing technology is highlighted by the ability        to generate sequence reads hundreds of kilobases in length. Pacific Biosciences        (PacBio) and Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) have pioneered competitive long        read platforms, with more recent work focused on improving sequencing throughput        and per-base accuracy. We used whole-genome sequencing data produced by three        PacBio protocols (Sequel II CLR, Sequel II HiFi, RS II) and two ONT protocols        (Rapid Sequencing and Ligation Sequencing) to compare assemblies of the bacteria        Escherichia coli and the fruit fly Drosophila ananassae. In both organisms        tested, Sequel II assemblies had the highest consensus accuracy, even after        accounting for differences in sequencing throughput. ONT and PacBio CLR had the        longest reads sequenced compared to PacBio RS II and HiFi, and genome contiguity        was highest when assembling these datasets. ONT Rapid Sequencing libraries had        the fewest chimeric reads in addition to superior quantification of E. coli        plasmids versus ligation-based libraries. The quality of assemblies can be        enhanced by adopting hybrid approaches using Illumina libraries for bacterial        genome assembly or polishing eukaryotic genome assemblies, and an ONT-Illumina        hybrid approach would be more cost-effective for many users. Genome-wide DNA        methylation could be detected using both technologies, however ONT libraries        enabled the identification of a broader range of known E. coli methyltransferase        recognition motifs in addition to undocumented D. ananassae motifs. The ideal        choice of long read technology may depend on several factors including the        question or hypothesis under examination.

10.3389/fgene.2024.1374860,Long read sequencing on its way to the routine diagnostics of genetic diseases.,2024.0,"The clinical application of technological progress in the identification of DNA        alterations has always led to improvements of diagnostic yields in genetic        medicine. At chromosome side, from cytogenetic techniques evaluating number and        gross structural defects to genomic microarrays detecting cryptic copy number        variants, and at molecular level, from Sanger method studying the nucleotide        sequence of single genes to the high-throughput next-generation sequencing (NGS)        technologies, resolution and sensitivity progressively increased expanding        considerably the range of detectable DNA anomalies and alongside of Mendelian        disorders with known genetic causes. However, particular genomic regions (i.e.,        repetitive and GC-rich sequences) are inefficiently analyzed by standard genetic        tests, still relying on laborious, time-consuming and low-sensitive approaches        (i.e., southern-blot for repeat expansion or long-PCR for genes with highly        homologous pseudogenes), accounting for at least part of the patients with        undiagnosed genetic disorders. Third generation sequencing, generating long reads        with improved mappability, is more suitable for the detection of structural        alterations and defects in hardly accessible genomic regions. Although recently        implemented and not yet clinically available, long read sequencing (LRS)        technologies have already shown their potential in genetic medicine research that        might greatly impact on diagnostic yield and reporting times, through their        translation to clinical settings. The main investigated LRS application concerns        the identification of structural variants and repeat expansions, probably because        techniques for their detection have not evolved as rapidly as those dedicated to        single nucleotide variants (SNV) identification: gold standard analyses are        karyotyping and microarrays for balanced and unbalanced chromosome        rearrangements, respectively, and southern blot and repeat-primed PCR for the        amplification and sizing of expanded alleles, impaired by limited resolution and        sensitivity that have not been significantly improved by the advent of NGS.        Nevertheless, more recently, with the increased accuracy provided by the latest        product releases, LRS has been tested also for SNV detection, especially in genes        with highly homologous pseudogenes and for haplotype reconstruction to assess the        parental origin of alleles with de novo pathogenic variants.

10.1186/s12864-020-07123-7,Illuminating the dark side of the human transcriptome with long read transcript        sequencing.,2020.0,"BACKGROUND: The human transcriptome annotation is regarded as one of the most        complete of any eukaryotic species. However, limitations in sequencing        technologies have biased the annotation toward multi-exonic protein coding genes.        Accurate high-throughput long read transcript sequencing can now provide        additional evidence for rare transcripts and genes such as mono-exonic and        non-coding genes that were previously either undetectable or impossible to        differentiate from sequencing noise. RESULTS: We developed the Transcriptome        Annotation by Modular Algorithms (TAMA) software to leverage the power of long        read transcript sequencing and address the issues with current data processing        pipelines. TAMA achieved high sensitivity and precision for gene and transcript        model predictions in both reference guided and unguided approaches in our        benchmark tests using simulated Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) and Nanopore        sequencing data and real PacBio datasets. By analyzing PacBio Sequel II Iso-Seq        sequencing data of the Universal Human Reference RNA (UHRR) using TAMA and other        commonly used tools, we found that the convention of using alignment identity to        measure error correction performance does not reflect actual gain in accuracy of        predicted transcript models. In addition, inter-read error correction can cause        major changes to read mapping, resulting in potentially over 6 K erroneous gene        model predictions in the Iso-Seq based human genome annotation. Using TAMA's        genome assembly based error correction and gene feature evidence, we predicted        2566 putative novel non-coding genes and 1557 putative novel protein coding gene        models. CONCLUSIONS: Long read transcript sequencing data has the power to        identify novel genes within the highly annotated human genome. The use of        parameter tuning and extensive output information of the TAMA software package        allows for in depth exploration of eukaryotic transcriptomes. We have found long        read data based evidence for thousands of unannotated genes within the human        genome. More development in sequencing library preparation and data processing        are required for differentiating sequencing noise from real genes in long read        RNA sequencing data.",8569b841a46a0fd1a4b6cb0b187ae003782d00bc,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/8569b841a46a0fd1a4b6cb0b187ae003782d00bc,33126848,PMC7596999,methodology,False,BMC genomics,100965258,0.5426512360572815,0.14,82,4.547,0.9597989949748744,0.34673366834170855,0.4147752703146719

In the early 2010s, the        introduction of a novel set of sequencing methodologies, presented by two        platforms, Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) and Oxford Nanopore Sequencing (ONT),        gave birth to third-generation sequencing (TGS). The innovative long-read        technologies turn genome sequencing into an ease-of-handle procedure by greatly        reducing the average time of library construction workflows and simplifying the        process of de novo genome assembly due to the generation of long reads. Long        sequencing reads produced by both TGS methodologies have already facilitated the        decipherment of transcriptional profiling since they enable the identification of        full-length transcripts without the need for assembly or the use of sophisticated        bioinformatics tools. Long-read technologies have also provided new insights into        the field of epitranscriptomics, by allowing the direct detection of RNA        modifications on native RNA molecules.

However,        inherently high error rates make the analysis of long-read sequencing data        challenging. While these error rates have been characterized for sequence and        splice site identification, it is still unclear how accurately LRS reads        represent transcript start and end sites. Here, we systematically assess the        variability and accuracy of mRNA terminal ends identified by LRS reads across        multiple sequencing platforms. We find substantial inconsistencies in both the        start and end coordinates of LRS reads spanning a gene, such that LRS reads often        fail to accurately recapitulate annotated or empirically derived terminal ends of        mRNA molecules. To address this challenge, we introduce an approach to condition        reads based on empirically derived terminal ends and identified a subset of reads        that are more likely to represent full-length transcripts. Our approach can        improve transcriptome analyses by enhancing the fidelity of transcript terminal        end identification, but may result in lower power to quantify genes or discover        novel isoforms.

10.1016/j.csbj.2021.07.030,Application of long-read sequencing to the detection of structural variants in        human cancer genomes.,2021.0,"In recent years, the so-called long-read sequencing technology has had a        substantial impact on various aspects of genome sciences. Here, we introduce        recent studies of cancerous structural variants (SVs) using long-read sequencing        technologies, namely Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) sequencers, Oxford Nanopore        Technologies (ONT) sequencers, and linked-read methods. By taking advantage of        long-read lengths, these technologies have enabled the precise detection of SVs,        including long insertions by transposable elements, such as LINE-1. In addition        to SV detection, the epigenome status (including DNA methylation and haplotype        information) surrounding SV loci has also been unveiled by long-read sequencing        technologies, to identify the effects of SVs. Among the various research fields        in which long-read sequencing has been applied, cancer genomics has shown the        most remarkable advances. In fact, many studies are beginning to shed light on        the detection of SVs and the elucidation of their complex structures in various        types of cancer. In the particular case of cancers, we summarize the technical        limitations of the application of this technology to the analysis of clinical        samples. We will introduce recent achievements from this viewpoint. However, a        similar approach will be started for other applications in the near future.        Therefore, by complementing the current short-read sequencing analysis, long-read        sequencing should reveal the complex nature of human genomes in their healthy and        disease states, which will open a new opportunity for a better understanding of        disease development and for a novel strategy for drug development.",09806deb2164c50f3729fb846d4fd73921b862ca,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/09806deb2164c50f3729fb846d4fd73921b862ca,34527193,PMC8350331,,False,Computational and structural biotechnology journal,101585369,0.4989957809448242,0.1368421052631579,26,6.155,0.8341708542713567,0.6532663316582915,0.4275511542781577
10.1186/s12864-023-09193-9,Highly accurate long reads are crucial for realizing the potential of        biodiversity genomics.,2022.0,"BACKGROUND: Generating the most contiguous, accurate genome assemblies given        available sequencing technologies is a long-standing challenge in genome science.        With the rise of long-read sequencing, assembly challenges have shifted from        merely increasing contiguity to correctly assembling complex, repetitive regions        of interest, ideally in a phased manner. At present, researchers largely choose        between two types of long read data: longer, but less accurate sequences, or        highly accurate, but shorter reads (i.e., >Q20 or 99% accurate). To better        understand how these types of long-read data as well as scale of data (i.e., mean        length and sequencing depth) influence genome assembly outcomes, we compared        genome assemblies for a caddisfly, Hesperophylax magnus, generated with longer,        but less accurate, Oxford Nanopore (ONT) R9.4.1 and highly accurate PacBio HiFi        (HiFi) data. Next, we expanded this comparison to consider the influence of        highly accurate long-read sequence data on genome assemblies across 6750 plant        and animal genomes. For this broader comparison, we used HiFi data as a surrogate        for highly accurate long-reads broadly as we could identify when they were used        from GenBank metadata. RESULTS: HiFi reads outperformed ONT reads in all assembly        metrics tested for the caddisfly data set and allowed for accurate assembly of        the repetitive ~ 20 Kb H-fibroin gene. Across plants and animals, genome        assemblies that incorporated HiFi reads were also more contiguous. For plants,        the average HiFi assembly was 501% more contiguous (mean contig N50 = 20.5 Mb)        than those generated with any other long-read data (mean contig N50 = 4.1 Mb).        For animals, HiFi assemblies were 226% more contiguous (mean contig        N50 = 20.9 Mb) versus other long-read assemblies (mean contig N50 = 9.3 Mb). In        plants, we also found limited evidence that HiFi may offer a unique solution for        overcoming genomic complexity that scales with assembly size. CONCLUSIONS: Highly        accurate long-reads generated with HiFi or analogous technologies represent a key        tool for maximizing genome assembly quality for a wide swath of plants and        animals. This finding is particularly important when resources only allow for one        type of sequencing data to be generated.

However, unlike small variants (< 50 bp), it has been challenging to accurately        identify and genotype SV at the population scale using short-read sequencing.        Long-read sequencing technologies are becoming competitively priced and can        address several of the disadvantages of short-read sequencing for the discovery        and genotyping of SV. In livestock species, analysis of SV at the population        scale still faces challenges due to the lack of resources, high costs,        technological barriers, and computational limitations. In this review, we        summarize recent progress in the characterization of SV in the major livestock        species, the obstacles that still need to be overcome, as well as the future        directions in this growing field. It seems timely that research communities pool        resources to build global population-scale long-read sequencing consortiums for        the major livestock species for which the application of genomic tools has become        cost-effective.",4dee0d74759756f4b7a36c13b287c87766b9b4cf,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/4dee0d74759756f4b7a36c13b287c87766b9b4cf,36721111,PMC9887926,background,False,"Genetics, selection, evolution : GSE",9114088,0.47180119156837463,0.05737704918032787,6,5.1,0.49748743718592964,0.5376884422110553,0.31976755905219123

For autism        spectrum disorders (ASD) cases where pathogenic variants fail to be found in the        protein-coding genic regions along chromosomes, we proposed a scalable workflow        to characterize the risk factor of SVs impacting non-coding elements of the        genome. We applied whole-genome sequencing on an Emirati family having three        children with ASD using long and short-read sequencing technology. A series of        analytical pipelines were established to identify a set of SVs with high        sensitivity and specificity. At 15-fold coverage, we observed that long-read        sequencing technology (987 variants) detected a significantly higher number of        SVs when compared to variants detected using short-read technology (509 variants)        (p-value < 1.1020 × 10(-57)). Further comparison showed 97.9% of long-read        sequencing variants were spanning within the 1-100 kb size range (p-value < 9.080        × 10(-67)) and impacting over 5000 genes. Moreover, long-read variants detected        604 non-coding RNAs (p-value < 9.02 × 10(-9)), comprising 58% microRNA, 31.9%        lncRNA, and 9.1% snoRNA.

10.1093/gigascience/giad100,Evaluating long-read de novo assembly tools for eukaryotic genomes: insights and        considerations.,2022.0,"BACKGROUND: Assembly algorithm choice should be a deliberate, well-justified        decision when researchers create genome assemblies for eukaryotic organisms from        third-generation sequencing technologies. While third-generation sequencing by        Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) and Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) has overcome        the disadvantages of short read lengths specific to next-generation sequencing        (NGS), third-generation sequencers are known to produce more error-prone reads,        thereby generating a new set of challenges for assembly algorithms and pipelines.        However, the introduction of HiFi reads, which offer substantially reduced error        rates, has provided a promising solution for more accurate assembly outcomes.        Since the introduction of third-generation sequencing technologies, many tools        have been developed that aim to take advantage of the longer reads, and        researchers need to choose the correct assembler for their projects. RESULTS: We        benchmarked state-of-the-art long-read de novo assemblers to help readers make a        balanced choice for the assembly of eukaryotes. To this end, we used 12 real and        64 simulated datasets from different eukaryotic genomes, with different read        length distributions, imitating PacBio continuous long-read (CLR), PacBio        high-fidelity (HiFi), and ONT sequencing to evaluate the assemblers. We include 5        commonly used long-read assemblers in our benchmark: Canu, Flye, Miniasm, Raven,        and wtdbg2 for ONT and PacBio CLR reads. For PacBio HiFi reads , we include 5        state-of-the-art HiFi assemblers: HiCanu, Flye, Hifiasm, LJA, and MBG. Evaluation        categories address the following metrics: reference-based metrics, assembly        statistics, misassembly count, BUSCO completeness, runtime, and RAM usage.        Additionally, we investigated the effect of increased read length on the quality        of the assemblies and report that read length can, but does not always,        positively impact assembly quality. CONCLUSIONS: Our benchmark concludes that        there is no assembler that performs the best in all the evaluation categories.        However, our results show that overall Flye is the best-performing assembler for        PacBio CLR and ONT reads, both on real and simulated data. Meanwhile,        best-performing PacBio HiFi assemblers are Hifiasm and LJA. Next, the        benchmarking using longer reads shows that the increased read length improves        assembly quality, but the extent to which that can be achieved depends on the        size and complexity of the reference genome.",5c2c309571c8d5e93d715552ab80c0ed30155502,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/5c2c309571c8d5e93d715552ab80c0ed30155502,38000912,PMC10673639,,False,GigaScience,101596872,0.4582577645778656,0.11764705882352941,0,7.658,0.0,0.7889447236180904,0.302877861445485
10.3390/microorganisms11010096,Accuracy and Completeness of Long Read Metagenomic Assemblies.,2022.0,"Microbes influence the surrounding environment and contribute to human health.        Metagenomics can be used as a tool to explore the interactions between microbes.        Metagenomic assemblies built using long read nanopore data depend on the read        level accuracy. The read level accuracy of nanopore sequencing has made dramatic        improvements over the past several years. However, we do not know if the        increased read level accuracy allows for faster assemblers to make as accurate        metagenomic assemblies as slower assemblers. Here, we present the results of a        benchmarking study comparing three commonly used long read assemblers, Flye,        Raven, and Redbean. We used a prepared DNA standard of seven bacteria as our        input community. We prepared a sequencing library using a VolTRAX V2 and        sequenced using a MinION mk1b. We basecalled with Guppy v5.0.7 using the        super-accuracy model. We found that increasing read depth benefited each of the        assemblers, and nearly complete community member chromosomes were assembled with        as little as 10× read depth. Polishing assemblies using Medaka had a predictable        improvement in quality. We found Flye to be the most robust across taxa and was        the most effective assembler for recovering plasmids. Based on Flye's consistency        for chromosomes and increased effectiveness at assembling plasmids, we would        recommend using Flye in future metagenomic studies.",047012017f922a04b7e9a839d1d6fcbf58457866,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/047012017f922a04b7e9a839d1d6fcbf58457866,36677391,PMC9861289,background,False,Microorganisms,101625893,0.44338953495025635,0.10256410256410256,1,4.926,0.135678391959799,0.49246231155778897,0.2682636070383561
10.1186/s12864-023-09255-y,Benchmarking datasets for assembly-based variant calling using high-fidelity long        reads.,2023.0,"BACKGROUND: Recent advances in long-read sequencing technologies have enabled        accurate identification of all genetic variants in individuals or cells; this        procedure is known as variant calling. However, benchmarking studies on variant        calling using different long-read sequencing technologies are still lacking.        RESULTS: We used two Caenorhabditis elegans strains to measure several variant        calling metrics. These two strains shared true-positive genetic variants that        were introduced during strain generation. In addition, both strains contained        common and distinguishable variants induced by DNA damage, possibly leading to        false-positive estimation. We obtained accurate and noisy long reads from both        strains using high-fidelity (HiFi) and continuous long-read (CLR) sequencing        platforms, and compared the variant calling performance of the two platforms.        HiFi identified a 1.65-fold higher number of true-positive variants on average,        with 60% fewer false-positive variants, than CLR did. We also compared read-based        and assembly-based variant calling methods in combination with subsampling of        various sequencing depths and demonstrated that variant calling after genome        assembly was particularly effective for detection of large insertions, even with        10 × sequencing depth of accurate long-read sequencing data. CONCLUSIONS: By        directly comparing the two long-read sequencing technologies, we demonstrated        that variant calling after genome assembly with 10 × or more depth of accurate        long-read sequencing data allowed reliable detection of true-positive variants.        Considering the high cost of HiFi sequencing, we herein propose appropriate        methodologies for performing cost-effective and high-quality variant calling: 10        × assembly-based variant calling.

10.1186/s13007-022-00971-2,Species-specific basecallers improve actual accuracy of nanopore sequencing in        plants.,2022.0,"BACKGROUND: Long-read sequencing platforms offered by Oxford Nanopore        Technologies (ONT) allow native DNA containing epigenetic modifications to be        directly sequenced, but can be limited by lower per-base accuracies. A key step        post-sequencing is basecalling, the process of converting raw electrical signals        produced by the sequencing device into nucleotide sequences. This is challenging        as current basecallers are primarily based on mixtures of model species for        training. Here we utilise both ONT PromethION and higher accuracy PacBio Sequel        II HiFi sequencing on two plants, Phebalium stellatum and Xanthorrhoea johnsonii,        to train species-specific basecaller models with the aim of improving per-base        accuracy. We investigate sequencing accuracies achieved by ONT basecallers and        assess accuracy gains by training single-species and species-specific basecaller        models. We also evaluate accuracy gains from ONT's improved flowcells (R10.4,        FLO-PRO112) and sequencing kits (SQK-LSK112). For the truth dataset for both        model training and accuracy assessment, we developed highly accurate, contiguous        diploid reference genomes with PacBio Sequel II HiFi reads. RESULTS: Basecalling        with ONT Guppy 5 and 6 super-accurate gave almost identical results, attaining        read accuracies of 91.96% and 94.15%. Guppy's plant-specific model gave highly        mixed results, attaining read accuracies of 91.47% and 96.18%. Species-specific        basecalling models improved read accuracy, attaining 93.24% and 95.16% read        accuracies. R10.4 sequencing kits also improve sequencing accuracy, attaining        read accuracies of 95.46% (super-accurate) and 96.87% (species-specific).        CONCLUSIONS: The use of a single mixed-species basecaller model, such as ONT        Guppy super-accurate, may be reducing the accuracy of nanopore sequencing, due to        conflicting genome biology within the training dataset and study species.        Training of single-species and genome-specific basecaller models improves read        accuracy. Studies that aim to do large-scale long-read genotyping would primarily        benefit from training their own basecalling models.

Main developments have focused on either        sequencing many short sequences or fewer large sequences.

Short-read sequencing remains the primary        approach for metagenomic research; however, long-read sequencing may offer        advantages of improved metagenomic assembly and resolved taxonomic        identification. To compare the relative performance for metagenomic studies, we        simulated short- and long-read datasets using increasingly complex metagenomes        comprising 10, 20, and 50 microbial taxa. Additionally, we used an empirical        dataset of paired short- and long-read data generated from mouse fecal pellets to        assess real-world performance. We compared metagenomic assembly quality,        taxonomic classification, and metagenome-assembled genome (MAG) recovery rates.        We show that long-read sequencing data significantly improve taxonomic        classification and assembly quality. Metagenomic assemblies using simulated long        reads were more complete and more contiguous with higher rates of MAG recovery.        This resulted in more precise taxonomic classifications.

Minimap2 is the state-of-the-art aligner and mapper used by the        leading long read sequencing technologies, today. However, Minimap2 on CPUs is        very slow for long noisy reads. ~60-70% of the run-time on a CPU comes from the        highly sequential chaining step in Minimap2. On the other hand, most        Point-of-Care computational workflows in long read sequencing use Graphics        Processing Units (GPUs). We present minimap2-accelerated (mm2-ax), a        heterogeneous design for sequence mapping and alignment where minimap2's compute        intensive chaining step is sped up on the GPU and demonstrate its time and cost        benefits.

10.1093/nar/gkac1112,Freddie: annotation-independent detection and discovery of transcriptomic        alternative splicing isoforms using long-read sequencing.,2022.0,"Alternative splicing (AS) is an important mechanism in the development of many        cancers, as novel or aberrant AS patterns play an important role as an        independent onco-driver. In addition, cancer-specific AS is potentially an        effective target of personalized cancer therapeutics. However, detecting AS        events remains a challenging task, especially if these AS events are novel. This        is exacerbated by the fact that existing transcriptome annotation databases are        far from being comprehensive, especially with regard to cancer-specific AS.        Additionally, traditional sequencing technologies are severely limited by the        short length of the generated reads, which rarely spans more than a single splice        junction site. Given these challenges, transcriptomic long-read (LR) sequencing        presents a promising potential for the detection and discovery of AS. We present        Freddie, a computational annotation-independent isoform discovery and detection        tool. Freddie takes as input transcriptomic LR sequencing of a sample alongside        its genomic split alignment and computes a set of isoforms for the given sample.        It then partitions the input reads into sets that can be processed independently        and in parallel. For each partition, Freddie segments the genomic alignment of        the reads into canonical exon segments. The goal of this segmentation is to be        able to represent any potential isoform as a subset of these canonical exons.        This segmentation is formulated as an optimization problem and is solved with a        dynamic programming algorithm. Then, Freddie reconstructs the isoforms by jointly        clustering and error-correcting the reads using the canonical segmentation as a        succinct representation. The clustering and error-correcting step is formulated        as an optimization problem-the Minimum Error Clustering into Isoforms (MErCi)        problem-and is solved using integer linear programming (ILP). We compare the        performance of Freddie on simulated datasets with other isoform detection tools        with varying dependence on annotation databases. We show that Freddie outperforms        the other tools in its accuracy, including those given the complete ground truth        annotation. We also run Freddie on a transcriptomic LR dataset generated in-house        from a prostate cancer cell line with a matched short-read RNA-seq dataset.        Freddie results in isoforms with a higher short-read cross-validation rate than        the other tested tools.

10.3389/fmolb.2021.711733,Isoform Age - Splice Isoform Profiling Using Long-Read Technologies.,2021.0,"Alternative splicing (AS) of RNA is a key mechanism that results in the        expression of multiple transcript isoforms from single genes and leads to an        increase in the complexity of both the transcriptome and proteome. Regulation of        AS is critical for the correct functioning of many biological pathways, while        disruption of AS can be directly pathogenic in diseases such as cancer or cause        risk for complex disorders. Current short-read sequencing technologies achieve        high read depth but are limited in their ability to resolve complex isoforms. In        this review we examine how long-read sequencing (LRS) technologies can address        this challenge by covering the entire RNA sequence in a single read and thereby        distinguish isoform changes that could impact RNA regulation or protein function.        Coupling LRS with technologies such as single cell sequencing, targeted        sequencing and spatial transcriptomics is producing a rapidly expanding suite of        technological approaches to profile alternative splicing at the isoform level        with unprecedented detail. In addition, integrating LRS with genotype now allows        the impact of genetic variation on isoform expression to be determined. Recent        results demonstrate the potential of these techniques to elucidate the landscape        of splicing, including in tissues such as the brain where AS is particularly        prevalent. Finally, we also discuss how AS can impact protein function,        potentially leading to novel therapeutic targets for a range of diseases.",183fa92838872cc4610e57954dc91ee231bca9b8,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/183fa92838872cc4610e57954dc91ee231bca9b8,34409069,PMC8364947,"background,methodology",False,Frontiers in molecular biosciences,101653173,0.355663001537323,0.1450381679389313,33,6.113,0.8844221105527639,0.6432160804020101,0.3938598962799855

Although short-read RNA-sequencing has increased our understanding of        isoform diversity, it is challenging to accurately detect full-length        transcripts, preventing the identification of many alternate isoforms. Long-read        sequencing technologies have made it possible to sequence full-length alternative        transcripts, accurately characterizing alternative splicing events, alternate        transcription start and end sites, and differences in UTR regions. Here, we use        Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) long-read RNA-sequencing (Iso-Seq) to examine the        transcriptomes of five organs in threespine stickleback fish (Gasterosteus        aculeatus), a widely used genetic model species.

However,        studying viruses in nature can be challenging due to low biomass and the lack of        universal gene markers. Though metagenomic short-read sequencing has greatly        improved our virus ecology toolkit-and revealed many critical ecosystem roles for        viruses-microdiverse populations and fine-scale genomic traits are missed. Some        of these microdiverse populations are abundant and the missed regions may be of        interest for identifying selection pressures that underpin evolutionary        constraints associated with hosts and environments. Though long-read sequencing        promises complete virus genomes on single reads, it currently suffers from high        DNA requirements and sequencing errors that limit accurate gene prediction. Here        we introduce VirION2, an integrated short- and long-read metagenomic wet-lab and        informatics pipeline that updates our previous method (VirION) to further enhance        the utility of long-read viral metagenomics. Using a viral mock community, we        first optimized laboratory protocols (polymerase choice, DNA shearing size, PCR        cycling) to enable 76% longer reads (now median length of 6,965 bp) from 100-fold        less input DNA (now 1 nanogram). Using a virome from a natural seawater sample,        we compared viromes generated with VirION2 against other library preparation        options (unamplified, original VirION, and short-read), and optimized downstream        informatics for improved long-read error correction and assembly. VirION2        assemblies combined with short-read based data ('enhanced' viromes), provided        significant improvements over VirION libraries in the recovery of longer and more        complete viral genomes, and our optimized error-correction strategy using long-        and short-read data achieved 99.97% accuracy. In the seawater virome, VirION2        assemblies captured 5,161 viral populations (including all of the virus        populations observed in the other assemblies), 30% of which were uniquely        assembled through inclusion of long-reads, and 22% of the top 10% most abundant        virus populations derived from assembly of long-reads. Viral populations unique        to VirION2 assemblies had significantly higher microdiversity means, which may        explain why short-read virome approaches failed to capture them.

Each of the phases has its        own error model. We hypothesized that hidden short-read scaffolding errors and        erroneous long-read contigs degrade the quality of short- and long-read hybrid        assemblies. We assembled the genome of Trematomus borchgrevinki from data        generated during each of the 3 phases and assessed the quality problems we        encountered. We developed strategies such as k-mer-assembled region replacement,        parameter optimization, and long-read sampling to address the error models. We        demonstrated that a k-mer-based strategy improved short-read assemblies as        measured by Benchmarking Universal Single-Copy Ortholog while mate-pair libraries        introduced hidden scaffolding errors and perturbed Benchmarking Universal        Single-Copy Ortholog scores. Furthermore, we found that although hybrid        assemblies can generate higher contiguity they tend to suffer from lower quality.        In addition, we found long-read-only assemblies can be optimized for contiguity        by subsampling length-restricted raw reads.

10.1093/bioinformatics/btaa835,PBSIM2: a simulator for long-read sequencers with a novel generative model of        quality scores.,2020.0,"MOTIVATION: Recent advances in high-throughput long-read sequencers, such as        PacBio and Oxford Nanopore sequencers, produce longer reads with more errors than        short-read sequencers. In addition to the high error rates of reads,        non-uniformity of errors leads to difficulties in various downstream analyses        using long reads. Many useful simulators, which characterize long-read error        patterns and simulate them, have been developed. However, there is still room for        improvement in the simulation of the non-uniformity of errors. RESULTS: To        capture characteristics of errors in reads for long-read sequencers, here, we        introduce a generative model for quality scores, in which a hidden Markov Model        with a latest model selection method, called factorized information criteria, is        utilized. We evaluated our developed simulator from various points, indicating        that our simulator successfully simulates reads that are consistent with real        reads.

10.1186/s12864-021-07927-1,"A graphical, interactive and GPU-enabled workflow to process long-read sequencing        data.",2021.0,"BACKGROUND: Long-read sequencing has great promise in enabling portable, rapid        molecular-assisted cancer diagnoses. A key challenge in democratizing long-read        sequencing technology in the biomedical and clinical community is the lack of        graphical bioinformatics software tools which can efficiently process the raw        nanopore reads, support graphical output and interactive visualizations for        interpretations of results. Another obstacle is that high performance software        tools for long-read sequencing data analyses often leverage graphics processing        units (GPU), which is challenging and time-consuming to configure, especially on        the cloud. RESULTS: We present a graphical cloud-enabled workflow for fast,        interactive analysis of nanopore sequencing data using GPUs. Users customize        parameters, monitor execution and visualize results through an accessible        graphical interface. The workflow and its components are completely containerized        to ensure reproducibility and facilitate installation of the GPU-enabled        software. We also provide an Amazon Machine Image (AMI) with all software and        drivers pre-installed for GPU computing on the cloud. Most importantly, we        demonstrate the potential of applying our software tools to reduce the turnaround        time of cancer diagnostics by generating blood cancer (NB4, K562, ME1, 238        MV4;11) cell line Nanopore data using the Flongle adapter. We observe a 29x        speedup and a 93x reduction in costs for the rate-limiting basecalling step in        the analysis of blood cancer cell line data. CONCLUSIONS: Our interactive and        efficient software tools will make analyses of Nanopore data using GPU and cloud        computing accessible to biomedical and clinical scientists, thus facilitating the        adoption of cost effective, fast, portable and real-time long-read sequencing.",b376fb1fdebb25a71dc9f8729cbd0cbc0b340eae,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/b376fb1fdebb25a71dc9f8729cbd0cbc0b340eae,34425749,PMC8381503,methodology,False,BMC genomics,100965258,0.31848517060279846,0.06451612903225806,7,4.547,0.5226130653266332,0.36683417085427134,0.25476908822087846
10.1093/gbe/evab138,Long Reads Are Revolutionizing 20 Years of Insect Genome Sequencing.,2021.0,"The first insect genome assembly (Drosophila melanogaster) was published two        decades ago. Today, nuclear genome assemblies are available for a staggering 601        insect species representing 20 orders. In this study, we analyzed the        most-contiguous assembly for each species and provide a ""state-of-the-field""        perspective, emphasizing taxonomic representation, assembly quality, gene        completeness, and sequencing technologies. Relative to species richness, genomic        efforts have been biased toward four orders (Diptera, Hymenoptera, Collembola,        and Phasmatodea), Coleoptera are underrepresented, and 11 orders still lack a        publicly available genome assembly. The average insect genome assembly is 439.2        Mb in length with 87.5% of single-copy benchmarking genes intact. Most notable        has been the impact of long-read sequencing; assemblies that incorporate long        reads are ∼48× more contiguous than those that do not. We offer four        recommendations as we collectively continue building insect genome resources: 1)        seek better integration between independent research groups and consortia, 2)        balance future sampling between filling taxonomic gaps and generating data for        targeted questions, 3) take advantage of long-read sequencing technologies, and        4) expand and improve gene annotations.",c03259754fd16ed74ca8068fe3053a171f25cd41,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/c03259754fd16ed74ca8068fe3053a171f25cd41,34152413,PMC8358217,,False,Genome biology and evolution,101509707,0.3156304955482483,0.0,68,4.065,0.9296482412060302,0.3015075376884422,0.2793625154986453

The burden of OPSCC, in high-income countries, has been steadily        increasing over the past 20 years. As a result, in the USA and in the UK, the        burden of HPV-related oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma in men has now        surpassed that of cervical cancer in women. However, the oncogenic impact of        high-risk HPV integration in oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinomas hasn't been        extensively studied. The present study aimed to explore the patterns of HPV        integration in oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinomas and to assess the        feasibility and reliability of long-read sequencing technology in detecting viral        integration events in oropharyngeal head and neck cancers. METHODS: A cohort of        eight HPV-positive OPSCC pre-treatment patient tumors (four males and four        females), were selected. All patients received a p16(INK4A) positive OPSCC        diagnosis and were treated at the McGill University Health Centre, a quaternary        center in Montreal. A minimum of 20mg of tumor tissue was used for DNA        extraction. Extracted DNA was subjected to Nanopore long-read sequencing to        detect and analyze for the presence of high-risk HPV sequences. PCR and Sanger        sequencing experiments were performed to confirm Nanopore long-read sequencing        readings. RESULTS: Nanopore long-read sequencing showed that seven out of eight        patient samples displayed either integrated or episomal high-risk HPV sequences.        Out of these seven samples, four displayed verifiable integration events upon        bioinformatic analysis. Integration confirmation experiments were designed for        all four samples using PCR-based methods. Sanger sequencing was also performed.        Four distinct HPV integration patterns were identified: concatemer chromosomal        integration in a single chromosome, bi-chromosomal concatemer integration, single        chromosome complete integration and bi-chromosomal complete integration. HPV        concatemer integration also proved more common than full HPV integration events.        CONCLUSION AND RELEVANCE: Long-read sequencing technologies can be effectively        used to assess HPV integration patterns in OPSCC tumors. Clinically, more        research should be conducted on the prognostication value of high-risk HPV        integration in OPSCC tumors using long-read sequencing technology.",917b18005a04c3ce14b085d7e3bf110bcf7e976e,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/917b18005a04c3ce14b085d7e3bf110bcf7e976e,37916168,PMC10616875,,False,Frontiers in oncology,101568867,0.31216028332710266,0.0,1,5.738,0.1407035175879397,0.5728643216080402,0.2006832608775278

In the Netherlands, core-genome MLST        (cgMLST) based on short-read sequencing is often used for molecular typing.        Long-read sequencing is more rapid and provides useful information about the        genome's structural composition but lacks the precision required for SNP-based        typing and cgMLST. Here we compared prophages among 50 complete E. faecium        genomes belonging to different lineages to explore whether a phage signature        would be usable for typing and identifying an outbreak caused by VRE. As a proof        of principle, we investigated if long-read sequencing data would allow for        identifying phage signatures and thereby outbreak-related isolates. RESULTS:        Analysis of complete genome sequences of publicly available isolates showed        variation in phage content among different lineages defined by MLST. We        identified phage present in multiple STs as well as phages uniquely detected        within a single lineage. Next, in silico phage typing was applied to twelve        MinION sequenced isolates belonging to two different genetic backgrounds, namely        ST117/CT24 and ST80/CT16. Genomic comparisons of the long-read-based assemblies        allowed us to correctly identify isolates of the same complex type based on        global genome architecture and specific phage signature similarity. CONCLUSIONS:        For rapid identification of related VRE isolates, phage content analysis in        long-read sequencing data is possible. This allows software development for        real-time typing analysis of long-read sequencing data, which will generate        results within several hours.

10.1002/cpz1.442,ntEdit+Sealer: Efficient Targeted Error Resolution and Automated Finishing of        Long-Read Genome Assemblies.,2022.0,"High-quality genome assemblies are crucial to many biological studies, and        utilizing long sequencing reads can help achieve higher assembly contiguity.        While long reads can resolve complex and repetitive regions of a genome, their        relatively high associated error rates are still a major limitation. Long reads        generally produce draft genome assemblies with lower base quality, which must be        corrected with a genome polishing step. Hybrid genome polishing solutions can        greatly improve the quality of long-read genome assemblies by utilizing more        accurate short reads to validate bases and correct errors. Currently available        hybrid polishing methods rely on read alignments, and are therefore        memory-intensive and do not scale well to large genomes. Here we describe        ntEdit+Sealer, an alignment-free, k-mer-based genome finishing protocol that        employs memory-efficient Bloom filters. The protocol includes ntEdit for        correcting base errors and small indels, and for marking potentially problematic        regions, then Sealer for filling both assembly gaps and problematic regions        flagged by ntEdit. ntEdit+Sealer produces highly accurate, error-corrected genome        assemblies, and is available as a Makefile pipeline from        https://github.com/bcgsc/ntedit_sealer_protocol. © 2022 The Authors.

However,        accurate reconstruction and quantification of full-length transcripts using        short-reads is limited, due to their length. Long-reads sequencing technologies        may provide a solution by sequencing full-length transcripts. We explored the use        of both Illumina short-reads and two long Oxford Nanopore Technology (cDNA and        Direct RNA) RNA-Seq reads for detecting global differential splicing during mouse        embryonic stem cell differentiation, applying several bioinformatics strategies:        gene-based, isoform-based and exon-based. We detected the strongest similarity        among the sequencing platforms at the gene level compared to exon-based and        isoform-based. Furthermore, the exon-based strategy discovered many differential        exon usage (DEU) events, mostly in a platform-dependent manner and in        non-differentially expressed genes. Thus, the platforms complemented each other        in the ability to detect DEUs (i.e. long-reads exhibited an advantage in        detecting DEUs at the UTRs, and short-reads detected more DEUs). Exons within 20        genes, detected in one or more platforms, were here validated by PCR, including        key differentiation genes, such as Mdb3 and Aplp1.

10.1186/s12864-022-08339-5,"Genion, an accurate tool to detect gene fusion from long transcriptomics reads.",2022.0,"BACKGROUND: The advent of next-generation sequencing technologies empowered a        wide variety of transcriptomics studies. A widely studied topic is gene fusion        which is observed in many cancer types and suspected of having oncogenic        properties. Gene fusions are the result of structural genomic events that bring        two genes closely located and result in a fused transcript. This is different        from fusion transcripts created during or after the transcription process. These        chimeric transcripts are also known as read-through and trans-splicing        transcripts. Gene fusion discovery with short reads is a well-studied problem,        and many methods have been developed. But the sensitivity of these methods is        limited by the technology, especially the short read length. Advances in        long-read sequencing technologies allow the generation of long transcriptomics        reads at a low cost. Transcriptomic long-read sequencing presents unique        opportunities to overcome the shortcomings of short-read technologies for gene        fusion detection while introducing new challenges. RESULTS: We present Genion, a        sensitive and fast gene fusion detection method that can also detect read-through        events. We compare Genion against a recently introduced long-read gene fusion        discovery method, LongGF, both on simulated and real datasets. On simulated data,        Genion accurately identifies the gene fusions and its clustering accuracy for        detecting fusion reads is better than LongGF. Furthermore, our results on the        breast cancer cell line MCF-7 show that Genion correctly identifies all the        experimentally validated gene fusions.

Amongst other advantages, LRS        preserves more information about RNA at the transcript level than conventional        high-throughput sequencing, including far more accurate and quantitative records        of splicing patterns. New studies with LRS datasets are being published at an        exponential rate, generating a vast reservoir of information that can be        leveraged to address a host of different research questions. However, mining such        publicly available data in a tailored fashion is currently not easy, as the        available software tools typically require familiarity with the command-line        interface, which constitutes a significant obstacle to many researchers.        Additionally, different research groups utilize different software packages to        perform LRS analysis, which often prevents a direct comparison of published        results across different studies. To address these challenges, we have developed        the Long-Read Analysis Pipeline for Transcriptomics (L-RAPiT), a user-friendly,        free pipeline requiring no dedicated computational resources or bioinformatics        expertise. L-RAPiT can be implemented directly through Google Colaboratory, a        system based on the open-source Jupyter notebook environment, and allows for the        direct analysis of transcriptomic reads from Oxford Nanopore and PacBio LRS        machines.

However, some genomic regions that are of high biological        interest remain problematic for assembly and data-handling. Three such regions        are the major histocompatibility complex (MHC), sex-determining regions (SDRs)        and the plant self-incompatibility locus (S-locus). Using these as examples, we        illustrate the challenges of both assembling and resequencing these highly        polymorphic regions and how bioinformatic and technological developments are        enabling new approaches to their study. Mapping short-read sequences against        multiple alternative references improves genotyping comprehensiveness at the        S-locus thereby contributing to more accurate assessments of allelic frequencies.        Long-read sequencing, producing reads of several tens to hundreds of kilobase        pairs in length, facilitates the assembly of such regions as single sequences can        span the multiple duplicated gene copies of the MHC region, and sequence through        repetitive stretches and translocations in SDRs and S-locus haplotypes. These        advances are adding value to short-read genome resequencing approaches by        allowing, for example, more accurate haplotype phasing across longer regions.

One such region is the highly polymorphic CYP2D loci,        containing CYP2D6, a clinically relevant pharmacogene contributing to the        metabolism of >20% of common drugs, and two highly similar pseudogenes, CYP2D7        and CYP2D8. Multiple complex SVs, including CYP2D6/CYP2D7-derived hybrid genes        are known to occur in different configurations and frequencies across populations        and are difficult to detect and characterize accurately. This can lead to        incorrect enzyme activity assignment and impact drug dosing recommendations,        often disproportionally affecting underrepresented populations.

In recent years, long-read        sequencing has greatly benefited genome assembly and scaffolding, a process by        which assembled sequences are ordered and oriented through the use of long-range        information. Long reads are better able to span repetitive genomic regions        compared to short reads, and thus have tremendous utility for resolving        problematic regions and helping generate more complete draft assemblies. Here, we        present LongStitch, a scalable pipeline that corrects and scaffolds draft genome        assemblies exclusively using long reads. RESULTS: LongStitch incorporates        multiple tools developed by our group and runs in up to three stages, which        includes initial assembly correction (Tigmint-long), followed by two incremental        scaffolding stages (ntLink and ARKS-long). Tigmint-long and ARKS-long are        misassembly correction and scaffolding utilities, respectively, previously        developed for linked reads, that we adapted for long reads. Here, we describe the        LongStitch pipeline and introduce our new long-read scaffolder, ntLink, which        utilizes lightweight minimizer mappings to join contigs. LongStitch was tested on        short and long-read assemblies of Caenorhabditis elegans, Oryza sativa, and three        different human individuals using corresponding nanopore long-read data, and        improves the contiguity of each assembly from 1.2-fold up to 304.6-fold (as        measured by NGA50 length). Furthermore, LongStitch generates more contiguous and        correct assemblies compared to state-of-the-art long-read scaffolder LRScaf in        most tests, and consistently improves upon human assemblies in under five hours        using less than 23 GB of RAM.

10.3390/mi13101754,High-Throughput Separation of Long DNA in Deterministic Lateral Displacement        Arrays.,2022.0,"Length-based separation of DNA remains as relevant today as when gel        electrophoresis was introduced almost 100 years ago. While new, long-read        genomics technologies have revolutionised accessibility to powerful genomic data,        the preparation of samples has not proceeded at the same pace, with sample        preparation often constituting a considerable bottleneck, both in time and        difficulty. Microfluidics holds great potential for automated, sample-to-answer        analysis via the integration of preparatory and analytical steps, but for this to        be fully realised, more versatile, powerful and integrable unit operations, such        as separation, are essential. We demonstrate the displacement and separation of        DNA with a throughput that is one to five orders of magnitude greater than other        microfluidic techniques. Using a device with a small footprint (23 mm × 0.5 mm),        and with feature sizes in the micrometre range, it is considerably easier to        fabricate than parallelized nano-array-based approaches. We show the separation        of 48.5 kbp and 166 kbp DNA strands achieving a significantly improved throughput        of 760 ng/h, compared to previous work and the separation of low concentrations        of 48.5 kbp DNA molecules from a massive background of sub 10 kbp fragments. We        show that the extension of DNA molecules at high flow velocities, generally        believed to make the length-based separation of long DNA difficult, does not        place the ultimate limitation on our method. Instead, we explore the effects of        polymer rotations and intermolecular interactions at extremely high DNA        concentrations and postulate that these may have both negative and positive        influences on the separation depending on the detailed experimental conditions.",857df1bf3337e071d54c1c7d613119251b4b14ef,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/857df1bf3337e071d54c1c7d613119251b4b14ef,36296107,PMC9611613,background,False,Micromachines,101640903,0.26189684867858887,0.0,7,3.523,0.5276381909547738,0.271356783919598,0.19841830083473241

A        non-targeted sequencing approach with rapid and precise characterization of        pathogens should help respiratory disease management by providing a comprehensive        view of the causes of disease. Long-read portable sequencers have significant        potential advantages over established short-read sequencers due to portability,        speed, and lower cost. The applicability of short reads random sequencing for        direct detection of pathogens in clinical poultry samples has been previously        demonstrated. Here we demonstrate the feasibility of long read random sequencing        approaches to identify disease agents in clinical samples. Experimental        oropharyngeal swab samples (n = 12) from chickens infected with infectious        bronchitis virus (IBV), avian influenza virus (AIV) and Mycoplasma synoviae (MS)        and field-collected clinical oropharyngeal swab samples (n = 11) from Kenyan live        bird markets previously testing positive for Newcastle disease virus (NDV) were        randomly sequenced on the MinION platform and results validated by comparing to        real time PCR and short read random sequencing in the Illumina MiSeq platform. In        the swabs from experimental infections, each of three agents in every        RT-qPCR-positive sample (Ct range 19-34) was detectable within 1 h on the MinION        platform, except for AIV one agent in one sample (Ct = 36.21). Nine of 12        IBV-positive samples were assigned genotypes within 1 h, as were five of 11        AIV-positive samples. MinION relative abundances of the test agent (AIV, IBV and        MS) were highly correlated with RT-qPCR Ct values (R range-0.82 to-0.98). In        field-collected clinical swab samples, NDV (Ct range 12-37) was detected in all        eleven samples within 1 h of MinION sequencing, with 10 of 11 samples accurately        genotyped within 1 h. All NDV-positive field samples were found to be co-infected        with one or more additional respiratory agents. These results demonstrate that        MinION sequencing can provide rapid, and sensitive non-targeted detection and        genetic characterization of co-existing respiratory pathogens in clinical samples        with similar performance to the Illumina MiSeq.",010cc6ba306c687c7472e8e3ba61285b8025c285,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/010cc6ba306c687c7472e8e3ba61285b8025c285,36532355,PMC9751482,background,False,Frontiers in veterinary science,101666658,0.26001349091529846,0.0,1,3.471,0.15577889447236182,0.2613065326633166,0.1405668613449413

Identifying these structural variants helps stratify disease by risk        and assists with therapy choice. Precise molecular diagnosis in        low-and-middle-income countries (LMIC) is challenging given the complexity of        assays, trained technical support, and the availability of reliable electricity.        Current fusion detection methods require a long turnaround time (7-10 days) or        advance knowledge of the genes involved in the fusions. Recent technology        developments have made sequencing possible without a sophisticated molecular        laboratory, potentially making molecular diagnosis accessible to remote areas and        low-income settings. We describe a long-read sequencing DNA assay designed with        CRISPR guides to select and enrich for recurrent leukemia fusion genes, that does        not need a priori knowledge of the abnormality present. By applying rapid        sequencing technology based on nanopores, we sequenced long pieces of genomic DNA        and successfully detected fusion genes in cell lines and primary specimens (e.g.,        BCR::ABL1, PML::RARA, CBFB::MYH11, KMT2A::AFF1) using cloud-based bioinformatics        workflows with novel custom fusion finder software. We detected fusion genes in        100% of cell lines with the expected breakpoints and confirmed the presence or        absence of a recurrent fusion gene in 12 of 14 patient cases. With our optimized        assay and cloud-based bioinformatics workflow, these assays and analyses could be        performed in under 8 hours. The platform's portability, potential for adaptation        to lower-cost devices, and integrated cloud analysis make this assay a candidate        to be placed in settings like LMIC to bridge the need of bedside rapid molecular        diagnostics.",c0da6b8e0212c871dc6fde193bb9c2ca84293c51,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/c0da6b8e0212c871dc6fde193bb9c2ca84293c51,37699001,PMC10497132,,False,PLOS global public health,9918283779606676,0.2587003707885742,0.047619047619047616,1,0.0,0.16080402010050251,0.035175879396984924,0.12605471520881442

Given the diversity in the size and type of SVs present in tumours, the        accurate detection and interpretation of SVs in tumours is challenging. New        classes of complex structural events in tumours are discovered frequently, and        the definitions of the genomic consequences of complex events are constantly        being refined. Detailed analyses of short-read whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data        from large tumour cohorts facilitate the interrogation of SVs at orders of        magnitude greater scale and depth. However, the inherent technical limitations of        short-read WGS prevent us from accurately detecting and investigating the impact        of all the SVs present in tumours. The expanded use of long-read WGS will be        critical for improving the accuracy of SV detection, and in fully resolving        complex SV events, both of which are crucial for determining the impact of SVs on        tumour progression and clinical outcome. Despite the present limitations, we        demonstrate that SVs play an important role in tumourigenesis. In particular, SVs        contribute significantly to late-stage tumour development and to intratumoural        heterogeneity. The evolutionary trajectories of SVs represent a window into the        clonal dynamics in tumours, a comprehensive understanding of which will be vital        for influencing patient outcomes in the future. Recent findings have highlighted        many clinical applications of SVs in cancer, from early detection to biomarkers        for treatment response and prognosis. As the methods to detect and interpret SVs        improve, elucidating the full breadth of the complex SV landscape and determining        how these events modulate tumour evolution will improve our understanding of        cancer biology and our ability to capitalise on the utility of SVs in the        clinical management of cancer patients. © 2022 The Authors.

However, the greater length and higher error rate of the reads generated on        long-read platforms make the tools used for assembling short reads unsuitable for        use in data assembly and motivate the development of new approaches. We present        LoReTTA (Long Read Template-Targeted Assembler), a tool designed for performing        de novo assembly of long reads generated from viral genomes on the PacBio        platform. LoReTTA exploits a reference genome to guide the assembly process, an        approach that has been successful with short reads. The tool was designed to deal        with reads originating from viral genomes, which feature high genetic        variability, possible multiple isoforms, and the dominant presence of additional        organisms in clinical or environmental samples. LoReTTA was tested on a range of        simulated and experimental datasets and outperformed established long-read        assemblers in terms of assembly contiguity and accuracy.

However, the use of single-molecule long reads improves        assembly quality (completeness and contiguity), but haplotype duplications still        pose assembly challenges. To address the effect of read length on genome assembly        quality, gene prediction and annotation, we compared genome assemblers and        sequencing technologies with four strains of the ectomycorrhizal fungus Laccaria        trichodermophora. By analysing the predicted repertoire of carbohydrate enzymes,        we investigated the effects of assembly quality on functional inferences.        Libraries were generated using three different sequencing platforms (Illumina        Next-Seq, Mi-Seq and PacBio Sequel), and genomes were assembled using single and        hybrid assemblies/libraries. Long reads or hybrid assemby resolved the collapsing        of repeated regions, but the nuclear heterozygous versions remained unresolved.        In dikaryotic fungi, each cell includes two nuclei and each nucleus has        differences not only in allelic gene version but also in gene composition and        synteny. These heterokaryotic cells produce fragmentation and size overestimation        of the genome assembly of each nucleus. Hybrid assembly revealed a wider        functional diversity of genomes. Here, several predicted oxidizing activities on        glycosyl residues of oligosaccharides and several chitooligosaccharide acetylase        activities would have passed unnoticed in short-read assemblies. Also, the size        and fragmentation of the genome assembly, in combination with heterozygosity        analysis, allowed us to distinguish homokaryotic and heterokaryotic strains        isolated from L. trichodermophora fruit bodies.",845286c0ef5537094a6b02f2a2e32fcc2c4ac764,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/845286c0ef5537094a6b02f2a2e32fcc2c4ac764,38529901,PMC10995626,,False,Microbial genomics,101671820,0.25367605686187744,0.06097560975609756,0,4.868,0.020100502512562814,0.4723618090452261,0.1743624076946706

In contrast,        many fungal species carry multiple haploid nuclei per cell. Rust fungi are such        species with two nuclei (karyons) that contain a full set of haploid chromosomes        each. The physical separation of haplotypes in dikaryons means that, unlike in        diploids, Hi-C chromatin contacts between haplotypes are false-positive signals.        RESULTS: We generate the first chromosome-scale, fully-phased assembly for the        dikaryotic leaf rust fungus Puccinia triticina and compare Nanopore MinION and        PacBio HiFi sequence-based assemblies. We show that false-positive Hi-C contacts        between haplotypes are predominantly caused by phase switches rather than by        collapsed regions or Hi-C read mis-mappings. We introduce a method for phasing of        dikaryotic genomes into the two haplotypes using Hi-C contact graphs, including a        phase switch correction step. In the HiFi assembly, relatively few phase switches        occur, and these are predominantly located at haplotig boundaries and can be        readily corrected. In contrast, phase switches are widespread throughout the        Nanopore assembly. We show that haploid genome read coverage of 30-40 times using        HiFi sequencing is required for phasing of the leaf rust genome, with 0.7%        heterozygosity, and that HiFi sequencing resolves genomic regions with low        heterozygosity that are otherwise collapsed in the Nanopore assembly.

We identify transcript isoforms enriched in specific subtypes and        discover novel transcript isoforms in extensively studied cancer genes such as        TP53. Among cancer genes, tumor suppressor genes (TSGs) are significantly        enriched for aberrant transcript isoforms targeted for degradation via mRNA        nonsense-mediated decay, revealing a common RNA-associated mechanism for TSG        inactivation. TEQUILA-seq reduces the per-reaction cost of targeted capture by        2-3 orders of magnitude, as compared to a standard commercial solution.        TEQUILA-seq can be broadly used for targeted sequencing of full-length        transcripts in diverse biomedical research settings.",705211672183c52c1361c7b53374cf5bdc6102f0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/705211672183c52c1361c7b53374cf5bdc6102f0,37553321,PMC10409798,,False,Nature communications,101528555,0.23265863955020905,0.07692307692307693,1,17.694,0.1658291457286432,0.914572864321608,0.26262712414183115

The advent of long-read sequencing        technologies offers the opportunity to study the role of genetic variation in        transcript structure(8-16). In this Article, we present a large human long-read        RNA-seq dataset using the Oxford Nanopore Technologies platform from 88 samples        from Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) tissues and cell lines, complementing the        GTEx resource. We identified just over 70,000 novel transcripts for annotated        genes, and validated the protein expression of 10% of novel transcripts. We        developed a new computational package, LORALS, to analyse the genetic effects of        rare and common variants on the transcriptome by allele-specific analysis of long        reads. We characterized allele-specific expression and transcript structure        events, providing new insights into the specific transcript alterations caused by        common and rare genetic variants and highlighting the resolution gained from        long-read data. We were able to perturb the transcript structure upon knockdown        of PTBP1, an RNA binding protein that mediates splicing, thereby finding genetic        regulatory effects that are modified by the cellular environment.

Prompt recognition of patients with C9orf72-associated diseases        is essential in light of upcoming clinical trials. The striking clinical        heterogeneity associated with C9orf72 repeat expansions remains largely        unexplained. In contrast to other repeat expansion disorders, evidence for an        effect of repeat length on phenotype is inconclusive. Patients with        C9orf72-associated diseases typically have very long repeat expansions,        containing hundreds to thousands of GGGGCC-repeats, but smaller expansions might        also have clinical significance. The exact threshold at which repeat expansions        lead to neurodegeneration is unknown, and discordant cut-offs between        laboratories pose a challenge for genetic counselling. Accurate and large-scale        measurement of repeat expansions has been severely hindered by technical        difficulties in sizing long expansions and by variable repeat lengths across and        within tissues.

Previous studies have shown that        genotype-based AMR has variable accuracy for predicting carbapenem resistance in        carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales (CRE); however, the majority of these        studies used short-read platforms (e.g. Illumina) to generate sequence data. In        this study, our objective was to determine whether Oxford Nanopore Technologies        (ONT) long-read WGS would improve detection of carbapenem AMR genes with respect        to short-read only WGS for nine clinical CRE samples. We measured the minimum        inhibitory breakpoint (MIC) using two phenotype assays (MicroScan and ETEST) for        six antibiotics, including two carbapenems (meropenem and ertapenem) and four        non-carbapenems (gentamicin, ciprofloxacin, cefepime, and        trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole). We generated short-read data using the Illumina        NextSeq and long-read data using the ONT MinION. Four assembly methods were        compared: ONT-only assembly; ONT-only assembly plus short-read polish;        ONT + short-read hybrid assembly plus short-read polish; short-read only        assembly. RESULTS: Consistent with previous studies, our results suggest that the        hybrid assembly produced the highest quality results as measured by gene        completeness and contig circularization. However, ONT-only methods had minimal        impact on the detection of AMR genes and plasmids compared to short-read methods,        although, notably, differences in gene copy number differed between methods. All        four assembly methods showed identical presence/absence of the blaKPC-2        carbapenemase gene for all samples. The two phenotype assays showed 100%        concordant results for the non-carbapenems, but only 65% concordance for the two        carbapenems. The presence/absence of AMR genes was 100% concordant with AMR        phenotypes for all four non-carbapenem drugs, although only 22%-50% sensitivity        for the carbapenems. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, these findings suggest that the lack        of complete correspondence between CRE AMR genotype and phenotype for        carbapenems, while concerning, is independent of sequencing platform/assembly        method.",bba96f367fdf7839adefe6368943343dccc83bd5,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/bba96f367fdf7839adefe6368943343dccc83bd5,37596530,PMC10436404,,False,BMC microbiology,100966981,0.22202466428279877,0.15,0,4.465,0.035175879396984924,0.33668341708542715,0.18238629375720142

TEs may jump around        the genome and disrupt both coding genes as well as regulatory sequences to cause        disease. Host cells have therefore evolved various epigenetic and functional        RNA-mediated mechanisms to mitigate the disruption of genomic integrity by TEs.        TE associated sequences therefore acquire the tendencies of attracting various        epigenetic modifiers to induce epigenetic alterations that may spread to the        neighboring genes. In addition to posting threats for (epi)genome integrity,        emerging evidence suggested the physiological importance of endogenous TEs either        as cis-acting control elements for controlling gene regulation or as        TE-containing functional transcripts that modulate the transcriptome of the host        cells.

Although long-read RNA-seq based on Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) offers the        advantage of covering transcripts in full length, its lower base accuracy poses        challenges for identifying individual exons, particularly microexons (≤ 30        nucleotides). Here, we systematically assess small exons quantification in        synthetic and human ONT RNA-seq datasets. We demonstrate that reads containing        small exons are often not properly aligned, affecting the quantification of        relevant transcripts. Thus, we develop a local-realignment method for misaligned        exons (MisER), which remaps reads with misaligned exons to the transcript        references. Using synthetic and simulated datasets, we demonstrate the high        sensitivity and specificity of MisER for the quantification of transcripts        containing small exons. Moreover, MisER enabled us to identify small exons with a        higher percent spliced-in index (PSI) in neural, particularly neural-regulated        microexons, when comparing 14 neural to 16 non-neural tissues in humans.

Chromosome level genome assemblies using sequence contigs generated from long        read sequencing have involved the use of proximity analysis (Hi-C) or traditional        genetic maps to guide the placement of sequence contigs within chromosomes. The        development of highly accurate long reads by repeated sequencing of circularized        DNA (HiFi; PacBio) has greatly increased the size of contigs. We now report the        use of HiFiasm to assemble the genome of Macadamia jansenii, a genome that has        been used as a model to test sequencing and assembly.

However, easy and automated construction of        high-quality bacterial genomes using nanopore reads remains challenging. Here we        aimed to create a reproducible end-to-end bacterial genome assembly pipeline        using ONT in combination with Illumina sequencing. RESULTS: We evaluated the        performance of several popular tools used during genome reconstruction, including        base-calling, filtering, assembly, and polishing. We also assessed overall genome        accuracy using ONT both natively and with Illumina. All steps were validated        using the high-quality complete reference genome for the Escherichia coli        sequence type (ST)131 strain EC958. Software chosen at each stage were        incorporated into our final pipeline, MicroPIPE. Further validation of MicroPIPE        was carried out using 11 additional ST131 E. coli isolates, which demonstrated        that complete circularised chromosomes and plasmids could be achieved without        manual intervention. Twelve publicly available Gram-negative and Gram-positive        bacterial genomes (with available raw ONT data and matched complete genomes) were        also assembled using MicroPIPE.

However, the analysis of cfDNA in cancer patients and        pregnant women has been focused on short DNA molecules (e.g., ≤ 600 bp). With the        detection of long cfDNA in the plasma of pregnant women and cancer patients in        two recent studies, a new avenue of long cfDNA-based liquid biopsy has been        opened. In this review, we summarize our current knowledge in this nascent field        of long cfDNA analysis, focusing on the fragmentomic and epigenetic features of        long cfDNA.

Little is known about        the prevalence of these events in SARS-CoV-2, partly because it is difficult to        detect them. We used long-read PacBio single-molecule real-time (SMRT) sequencing        technology to sequence whole genomes and targeted regions for haplotyping. We        identified 17 co-infections with SARS-CoV-2 strains belonging to different clades        in 6829 samples sequenced between January and October, 2022 (prevalence 0.25%).        There were 3 Delta/Omicron co-infections and 14 Omicron/Omicron co-infections (4        cases of 21K/21L, 1 case of 21L/22A, 2 cases of 21L/22B, 4 cases of 22A/22B, 2        cases of 22B/22C and 1 case of 22B/22E). Four of these patients (24%) also        harbored recombinant minor haplotypes, including one with a recombinant virus        that was selected in the viral quasispecies over the course of his chronic        infection. While co-infections remain rare among SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals,        long-read SMRT sequencing is a useful tool for detecting them as well as        recombinant events, providing the basis for assessing their clinical impact, and        a precise indicator of epidemic evolution. IMPORTANCE SARS-CoV-2 variants have        been responsible for the successive waves of infection over the 3 years of        pandemic. While co-infection followed by recombination is one driver of virus        evolution, there have been few reports of co-infections, mainly between Delta and        Omicron variants or between the first 2 Omicron variants 21K_BA.1 and 21L_BA.2.        The 17 co-infections we detected during 2022 included cases with the recent        clades of Omicron 22A, 22B, 22C, and 22E; 24% harbored recombinant variants.

10.1186/s13015-021-00186-5,LazyB: fast and cheap genome assembly.,2021.0,"BACKGROUND: Advances in genome sequencing over the last years have lead to a        fundamental paradigm shift in the field. With steadily decreasing sequencing        costs, genome projects are no longer limited by the cost of raw sequencing data,        but rather by computational problems associated with genome assembly. There is an        urgent demand for more efficient and and more accurate methods is particular with        regard to the highly complex and often very large genomes of animals and plants.        Most recently, ""hybrid"" methods that integrate short and long read data have been        devised to address this need. RESULTS: LazyB is such a hybrid genome assembler.        It has been designed specificially with an emphasis on utilizing low-coverage        short and long reads. LazyB starts from a bipartite overlap graph between long        reads and restrictively filtered short-read unitigs. This graph is translated        into a long-read overlap graph G. Instead of the more conventional approach of        removing tips, bubbles, and other local features, LazyB stepwisely extracts        subgraphs whose global properties approach a disjoint union of paths. First, a        consistently oriented subgraph is extracted, which in a second step is reduced to        a directed acyclic graph. In the next step, properties of proper interval graphs        are used to extract contigs as maximum weight paths. These path are translated        into genomic sequences only in the final step. A prototype implementation of        LazyB, entirely written in python, not only yields significantly more accurate        assemblies of the yeast and fruit fly genomes compared to state-of-the-art        pipelines but also requires much less computational effort. CONCLUSIONS: LazyB is        new low-cost genome assembler that copes well with large genomes and low        coverage. It is based on a novel approach for reducing the overlap graph to a        collection of paths, thus opening new avenues for future improvements.

10.1186/s12859-021-04547-0,Lerna: transformer architectures for configuring error correction tools for        short- and long-read genome sequencing.,2021.0,"BACKGROUND: Sequencing technologies are prone to errors, making error correction        (EC) necessary for downstream applications. EC tools need to be manually        configured for optimal performance. We find that the optimal parameters (e.g.,        k-mer size) are both tool- and dataset-dependent. Moreover, evaluating the        performance (i.e., Alignment-rate or Gain) of a given tool usually relies on a        reference genome, but quality reference genomes are not always available. We        introduce Lerna for the automated configuration of k-mer-based EC tools. Lerna        first creates a language model (LM) of the uncorrected genomic reads, and then,        based on this LM, calculates a metric called the perplexity metric to evaluate        the corrected reads for different parameter choices. Next, it finds the one that        produces the highest alignment rate without using a reference genome. The        fundamental intuition of our approach is that the perplexity metric is inversely        correlated with the quality of the assembly after error correction. Therefore,        Lerna leverages the perplexity metric for automated tuning of k-mer sizes without        needing a reference genome. RESULTS: First, we show that the best k-mer value can        vary for different datasets, even for the same EC tool. This motivates our design        that automates k-mer size selection without using a reference genome. Second, we        show the gains of our LM using its component attention-based transformers. We        show the model's estimation of the perplexity metric before and after error        correction. The lower the perplexity after correction, the better the k-mer size.        We also show that the alignment rate and assembly quality computed for the        corrected reads are strongly negatively correlated with the perplexity, enabling        the automated selection of k-mer values for better error correction, and hence,        improved assembly quality. We validate our approach on both short and long reads.        Additionally, we show that our attention-based models have significant runtime        improvement for the entire pipeline-18[Formula: see text] faster than previous        works, due to parallelizing the attention mechanism and the use of JIT        compilation for GPU inferencing.

These transcripts are often lacking from reference        transcript sets, such as Ensembl/GENCODE and RefSeq, and could be relevant for        establishing genetic diagnoses. We present SUsPECT (Solving Unsolved Patient        Exomes/gEnomes using Custom Transcriptomes), a pipeline based on the Ensembl        Variant Effect Predictor (VEP) to predict variant impact on custom transcript        sets, such as those generated by long-read RNA-sequencing, for downstream        prioritization.

These long reads allow protein domain annotation without assembly,        thus can produce important insights into the biological functions of the        underlying data. However, the high error rate in TGS data raises a new challenge        to established domain analysis pipelines. The state-of-the-art methods are not        optimized for noisy reads and have shown unsatisfactory accuracy of domain        classification in TGS data.

RESULTS: In this work,        we introduce ProDOMA, a deep learning model that conducts domain classification        for TGS reads. It uses deep neural networks with 3-frame translation encoding to        learn conserved features from partially correct translations.

However, it        still has many gaps and errors, and does not represent a biological genome as it        is a blend of multiple individuals(3,4). Recently, a high-quality        telomere-to-telomere reference, CHM13, was generated with the latest long-read        technologies, but it was derived from a hydatidiform mole cell line with a nearly        homozygous genome(5).

Polymorphic DNA        variation is superimposed as an extra layer of complexity in such processes which        underpin our individuality and are the focus of personalized medicine. This        review focuses on the role and action of repetitive DNA, specifically variable        number tandem repeats and SINE-VNTR-Alu domains, highlighting their role in        modification of gene structure and gene expression in addition to their        polymorphic nature being a genetic modifier of disease risk and progression.        Although the literature focuses on their role in disease, it illustrates their        potential to be major contributors to normal physiological function. To date,        these elements have been under-reported in genomic analysis due to the        difficulties in their characterization with short read DNA sequencing methods.

10.1016/j.jare.2022.10.012,Improvement of large copy number variant detection by whole genome nanopore        sequencing.,2022.0,"INTRODUCTION: Whole-genome sequencing using nanopore technologies can uncover        structural variants, which are DNA rearrangements larger than 50 base pairs.        Nanopore technologies can also characterize their boundaries with single-base        accuracy, owing to the kilobase-long reads that encompass either full variants or        their junctions. Other methods, such as next-generation short read sequencing or        PCR assays, are limited in their capabilities to detect or characterize        structural variants. However, the existing software for nanopore sequencing data        analysis still reports incomplete variant sets, which also contain erroneous        calls, a considerable obstacle for the molecular diagnosis or accurate genotyping        of populations. METHODS: We compared multiple factors affecting variant calling,        such as reference genome version, aligner (minimap2, NGMLR, and lra) choice, and        variant caller combinations (Sniffles, CuteSV, SVIM, and NanoVar), to find the        optimal group of tools for calling large (>50 kb) deletions and duplications,        using data from seven patients exhibiting gross gene defects on SERPINC1 and from        a reference variant set as the control. The goal was to obtain the most complete,        yet reasonably specific group of large variants using a single cell of PromethION        sequencing, which yielded lower depth coverage than short-read sequencing. We        also used a custom method for the statistical analysis of the coverage value to        refine the resulting datasets. RESULTS: We found that for large deletions and        duplications (>50 kb), the existing software performed worse than for smaller        ones, in terms of both sensitivity and specificity, and newer tools had not        improved this. Our novel software, disCoverage, could polish variant callers'        results, improving specificity by up to 62% and sensitivity by 15%, the latter        requiring other data or samples. CONCLUSION: We analyzed the current situation of        >50-kb copy number variants with nanopore sequencing, which could be improved.        The methods presented in this work could help to identify the known deletions and        duplications in a set of patients, while also helping to filter out erroneous        calls for these variants, which might aid the efforts to characterize a not-yet        well-known fraction of genetic variability in the human genome.",36a480e1cb8de9639f8e3999ca9d61cd6293e16d,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/36a480e1cb8de9639f8e3999ca9d61cd6293e16d,36323370,PMC10403694,"background,methodology",False,Journal of advanced research,101546952,0.17582091689109802,0.05172413793103448,2,12.822,0.2562814070351759,0.8743718592964824,0.24303392018949194

We evaluated the performance        of long-read (LR) and/or short-read (SR) sequencing for anti-TB drug-resistance        prediction using the TBProfiler and Mykrobe tools, the fraction of genome        recovery, assembly accuracies and the robustness of two typing approaches based        on core-genome SNP (cgSNP) typing and core-genome multi-locus sequence typing        (cgMLST). Most of the discrepancies between phenotypic drug-susceptibility        testing (DST) and drug-resistance prediction were observed for the first-line        drugs rifampicin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide and ethambutol, mainly with LR sequence        data. Resistance prediction to second-line drugs made by both TBProfiler and        Mykrobe tools with SR- and LR-sequence data were in complete agreement with        phenotypic DST except for one isolate. The SR assemblies were more accurate than        the LR assemblies, having significantly (P<0.05) fewer indels and mismatches per        100 kbp. However, the hybrid and LR assemblies had slightly higher genome        fractions. For LR assemblies, Canu followed by Racon, and Medaka polishing was        the most accurate approach. The cgSNP approach, based on either reads or        assemblies, was more robust than the cgMLST approach, especially for LR sequence        data. In conclusion, anti-TB drug-resistance prediction, particularly with only        LR sequence data, remains challenging, especially for first-line drugs. In        addition, SR assemblies appear more accurate than LR ones, and reproducible        phylogeny can be achieved using cgSNP approaches.",34d702afc34b082f1dca6d80ee07af2b0a7133d5,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/34d702afc34b082f1dca6d80ee07af2b0a7133d5,34825880,PMC8743536,background,False,Microbial genomics,101671820,0.1755380779504776,0.058823529411764705,14,4.868,0.6984924623115578,0.47738693467336685,0.25257274469758784

These disorders        can be caused by mutations in nuclear genes coding proteins with mitochondrial        localization or by genetic defects in the mitochondrial genome (mtDNA). The        latter include point pathogenic variants and large-scale        deletions/rearrangements. MtDNA molecules with the wild type or a variant        sequence can exist together in a single cell, a condition known as mtDNA        heteroplasmy. MtDNA single point mutations are typically detected by means of        Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) based on short reads which, however, are limited        for the identification of structural mtDNA alterations. Recently, new NGS        technologies based on long reads have been released, allowing to obtain sequences        of several kilobases in length; this approach is suitable for detection of        structural alterations affecting the mitochondrial genome. In the present work we        illustrate the optimization of two sequencing protocols based on long-read Oxford        Nanopore Technology to detect mtDNA structural alterations.

Long-read sequencing platforms offer the opportunity to make        definitive molecular diagnoses using a single assay capable of detecting        variants, characterizing methylation patterns, resolving complex rearrangements,        and assigning findings to long-range haplotypes. Here, we demonstrate the        clinical utility of Nanopore long-read sequencing by validating a confirmatory        test for copy number variants (CNVs) in neurodevelopmental disorders and        illustrate the broader applications of this platform to assess genomic features        with significant clinical implications. METHODS: We used adaptive sampling on the        Oxford Nanopore platform to sequence 25 genomic DNA samples and 5 blood samples        collected from patients with known or false-positive copy number changes        originally detected using short-read sequencing. Across the 30 samples (a total        of 50 with replicates), we assayed 35 known unique CNVs (a total of 55 with        replicates) and one false-positive CNV, ranging in size from 40 kb to 155 Mb, and        assessed the presence or absence of suspected CNVs using normalized read depth.        RESULTS: Across 50 samples (including replicates) sequenced on individual MinION        flow cells, we achieved an average on-target mean depth of 9.5X and an average        on-target read length of 4805 bp. Using a custom read depth-based analysis, we        successfully confirmed the presence of all 55 known CNVs (including replicates)        and the absence of one false-positive CNV. Using the same CNV-targeted data, we        compared genotypes of single nucleotide variant loci to verify that no sample        mix-ups occurred between assays. For one case, we also used methylation detection        and phasing to investigate the parental origin of a 15q11.2-q13 duplication with        implications for clinical prognosis. CONCLUSIONS: We present an assay that        efficiently targets genomic regions to confirm clinically relevant CNVs with a        concordance rate of 100%.

Long-read sequencing (LRS) offers a potential solution to genome-wide STR        analysis. However, characterizing STRs in human genomes using LRS on a large        population scale has not been reported. Methods: We conducted the large LRS-based        STR analysis in 193 unrelated samples of the Chinese population and performed        genome-wide profiling of STR variation in the human genome. The repeat dynamic        index (RDI) was introduced to evaluate the variability of STR. We sourced the        expression data from the Genotype-Tissue Expression to explore the tissue        specificity of highly variable STRs related genes across tissues. Enrichment        analyses were also conducted to identify potential functional roles of the high        variable STRs. Results: This study reports the large-scale analysis of human STR        variation by LRS and offers a reference STR database based on the LRS dataset. We        found that the disease-associated STRs (dSTRs) and STRs associated with the        expression of nearby genes (eSTRs) were highly variable in the general        population. Moreover, tissue-specific expression analysis showed that those        highly variable STRs related genes presented the highest expression level in        brain tissues, and enrichment pathways analysis found those STRs are involved in        synaptic function-related pathways.

A total of 275 protein-coding genes encoded by Chr 18 was        taken as the gene set for evaluation. The combination of Illumina RNASeq and        MinION nanopore technologies enabled the detection of at least one transcript for        each protein-coding gene encoded by Chr 18. This combination also reduced the        probability of false-positive detection of low-copy transcripts due to the        simultaneous confirmation of the presence of a transcript by the two        fundamentally different technologies: short reads essential for reliable        detection (Illumina RNASeq) and long-read sequencing data (MinION). The        combination of these technologies achieved complete coverage of all 275        protein-coding genes on Chr 18, identifying transcripts with non-zero expression        levels. This approach can improve distinguishing the biological and technical        reasons for the absence of mRNA detection for a given gene in transcriptomics.",f74ed831bb7e1c3d9f06f939bc668ceb6a975e65,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/f74ed831bb7e1c3d9f06f939bc668ceb6a975e65,34194472,PMC8238407,,False,Frontiers in genetics,101560621,0.14990432560443878,0.0,6,4.772,0.5025125628140703,0.4371859296482412,0.18592607155067836

A case study in the Prunus        salicina LG3-MYB10 genes cluster.,2022.0,"BACKGROUND: Genome complexity is largely linked to diversification and crop        innovation. Examples of regions with duplicated genes with relevant roles in        agricultural traits are found in many crops. In both duplicated and        non-duplicated genes, much of the variability in agronomic traits is caused by        large as well as small and middle scale structural variants (SVs), which        highlights the relevance of the identification and characterization of complex        variability between genomes for plant breeding. RESULTS: Here we improve and        demonstrate the use of CRISPR-Cas9 enrichment combined with long-read sequencing        technology to resolve the MYB10 region in the linkage group 3 (LG3) of Japanese        plum (Prunus salicina). This region, which has a length from 90 to 271 kb        according to the P. salicina genomes available, is associated with fruit color        variability in Prunus species. We demonstrate the high complexity of this region,        with homology levels between Japanese plum varieties comparable to those between        Prunus species. We cleaved MYB10 genes in five plum varieties using the Cas9        enzyme guided by a pool of crRNAs. The barcoded fragments were then pooled and        sequenced in a single MinION Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) run, yielding        194 Mb of sequence. The enrichment was confirmed by aligning the long reads to        the plum reference genomes, with a mean read on-target value of 4.5% and a depth        per sample of 11.9x. From the alignment, 3261 SNPs and 287 SVs were called and        phased. A de novo assembly was constructed for each variety, which also allowed        detection, at the haplotype level, of the variability in this region.        CONCLUSIONS: CRISPR-Cas9 enrichment is a versatile and powerful tool for        long-read targeted sequencing even on highly duplicated and/or polymorphic        genomic regions, being especially useful when a reference genome is not        available.

10.1186/s13059-021-02439-3,Nanopore sequencing reveals endogenous NMD-targeted isoforms in human cells.,2021.0,"BACKGROUND: Nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) is a eukaryotic,        translation-dependent degradation pathway that targets mRNAs with premature        termination codons and also regulates the expression of some mRNAs that encode        full-length proteins. Although many genes express NMD-sensitive transcripts,        identifying them based on short-read sequencing data remains a challenge.        RESULTS: To identify and analyze endogenous targets of NMD, we apply cDNA        Nanopore sequencing and short-read sequencing to human cells with varying        expression levels of NMD factors. Our approach detects full-length NMD substrates        that are highly unstable and increase in levels or even only appear when NMD is        inhibited. Among the many new NMD-targeted isoforms that our analysis identifies,        most derive from alternative exon usage. The isoform-aware analysis reveals many        genes with significant changes in splicing but no significant changes in overall        expression levels upon NMD knockdown. NMD-sensitive mRNAs have more exons in the        3΄UTR and, for those mRNAs with a termination codon in the last exon, the length        of the 3΄UTR per se does not correlate with NMD sensitivity. Analysis of splicing        signals reveals isoforms where NMD has been co-opted in the regulation of gene        expression, though the main function of NMD seems to be ridding the transcriptome        of isoforms resulting from spurious splicing events. CONCLUSIONS: Long-read        sequencing enables the identification of many novel NMD-sensitive mRNAs and        reveals both known and unexpected features concerning their biogenesis and their        biological role.

10.3390/genes13020333,Methods to Improve Molecular Diagnosis in Genomic Cold Cases in Pediatric        Neurology.,2022.0,"During the last decade, genetic testing has emerged as an important etiological        diagnostic tool for Mendelian diseases, including pediatric neurological        conditions. A genetic diagnosis has a considerable impact on disease management        and treatment; however, many cases remain undiagnosed after applying standard        diagnostic sequencing techniques. This review discusses various methods to        improve the molecular diagnostic rates in these genomic cold cases. We discuss        extended analysis methods to consider, non-Mendelian inheritance models,        mosaicism, dual/multiple diagnoses, periodic re-analysis, artificial intelligence        tools, and deep phenotyping, in addition to integrating various omics methods to        improve variant prioritization. Last, novel genomic technologies, including        long-read sequencing, artificial long-read sequencing, and optical genome mapping        are discussed. In conclusion, a more comprehensive molecular analysis and a        timely re-analysis of unsolved cases are imperative to improve diagnostic rates.        In addition, our current understanding of the human genome is still limited due        to restrictions in technologies. Novel technologies are now available that        improve upon some of these limitations and can capture all human genomic        variation more accurately.

Many rodent-infectious Plasmodium species, like        Plasmodium berghei, Plasmodium chabaudi , and Plasmodium yoelii , have been used        as genetically tractable model species that can expedite studies of this        pathogen. In particular, P. yoelii is an especially good model for investigating        the mosquito and liver stages of parasite development because key attributes        closely resemble those of P. falciparum . Because of its importance to malaria        research, in 2002 the 17XNL strain of P. yoelii was the first rodent malaria        parasite to be sequenced. While sequencing and assembling this genome was a        breakthrough effort, the final assembly consisted of >5000 contiguous sequences        that impacted the creation of annotated gene models. While other important rodent        malaria parasite genomes have been sequenced and annotated since then, including        the related P. yoelii 17X strain, the 17XNL strain has not. As a result, genomic        data for 17X has become the de facto reference genome for the 17XNL strain while        leaving open questions surrounding possible differences between the 17XNL and 17X        genomes. In this work, we present a high-quality genome assembly for P. yoelii        17XNL using HiFi PacBio long-read DNA sequencing.

A comparison of        the 17X and this new 17XNL assembly revealed biologically meaningful differences        between the strains due to the presence of coding sequence variants.

Systematically assessing reproducibility of inherited variants with WGS and        impact of each step in the process is needed for understanding and improving        quality of inherited variants from WGS. RESULTS: To dissect the impact of factors        involved in detection of inherited variants with WGS, we sequence triplicates of        eight DNA samples representing two populations on three short-read sequencing        platforms using three library kits in six labs and call variants with 56        combinations of aligners and callers. We find that bioinformatics pipelines        (callers and aligners) have a larger impact on variant reproducibility than WGS        platform or library preparation. Single-nucleotide variants (SNVs), particularly        outside difficult-to-map regions, are more reproducible than small insertions and        deletions (indels), which are least reproducible when > 5 bp. Increasing        sequencing coverage improves indel reproducibility but has limited impact on SNVs        above 30×.

Chloroplast genomes are commonly used in evolutionary studies        and taxonomic identification and are increasingly becoming a target for crop        improvement studies. As DNA sequencing becomes more affordable, researchers are        collecting vast swathes of high-quality whole-genome sequence data from        laboratory and field settings alike. Whole tissue read libraries sequenced with        the primary goal of understanding the nuclear genome will inadvertently contain        many reads derived from the chloroplast genome. These whole-genome, whole-tissue        read libraries can additionally be used to assemble chloroplast genomes with        little to no extra cost. While several tools exist that make use of short-read        second generation and third-generation long-read sequencing data for chloroplast        genome assembly, these tools may have complex installation steps, inadequate        error reporting, poor expandability, and/or lack scalability.

10.1186/s12859-023-05445-3,A systematic comparison of human mitochondrial genome assembly tools.,2023.0,"BACKGROUND: Mitochondria are the cell organelles that produce most of the        chemical energy required to power the cell's biochemical reactions. Despite being        a part of a eukaryotic host cell, the mitochondria contain a separate genome        whose origin is linked with the endosymbiosis of a prokaryotic cell by the host        cell and encode independent genomic information throughout their genomes.        Mitochondrial genomes accommodate essential genes and are regularly utilized in        biotechnology and phylogenetics. Various assemblers capable of generating        complete mitochondrial genomes are being continuously developed. These tools        often use whole-genome sequencing data as an input containing reads from the        mitochondrial genome. Till now, no published work has explored the systematic        comparison of all the available tools for assembling human mitochondrial genomes        using short-read sequencing data. This evaluation is required to identify the        best tool that can be well-optimized for small-scale projects or even        national-level research. RESULTS: In this study, we have tested the mitochondrial        genome assemblers for both simulated datasets and whole genome sequencing (WGS)        datasets of humans. For the highest computational setting of 16 computational        threads with the simulated dataset having 1000X read depth, MitoFlex took the        least execution time of 69 s, and IOGA took the longest execution time of 1278 s.        NOVOPlasty utilized the least computational memory of approximately 0.098 GB for        the same setting, whereas IOGA utilized the highest computational memory of        11.858 GB. In the case of WGS datasets for humans, GetOrganelle and MitoFlex        performed the best in capturing the SNPs information with a mean F1-score of        0.919 at the sequencing depth of 10X. MToolBox and NOVOPlasty performed        consistently across all sequencing depths with a mean F1 score of 0.897 and        0.890, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Based on the overall performance metrics and        consistency in assembly quality for all sequencing data, MToolBox performed the        best. However, NOVOPlasty was the second fastest tool in execution time despite        being single-threaded, and it utilized the least computational resources among        all the assemblers when tested on simulated datasets. Therefore, NOVOPlasty may        be more practical when there is a significant sample size and a lack of        computational resources.

There is a growing interest to utilize transcriptome data to unravel activated        biological processes responsible for disease progression and response to        therapies. This trend is of particular interest for precision medicine which aims        at single-patient analysis. Here we evaluated whether gene abundances measured by        MinION direct RNA sequencing are suited to produce robust estimates of pathway        activation for single sample scoring methods. We performed multiple RNA-seq        analyses for a single sample that originated from the HepG2 cell line, namely        five ONT replicates, and three replicates using Illumina NovaSeq. Two pathway        scoring methods were employed-ssGSEA and singscore. We estimated the ONT        performance in terms of detected protein-coding genes and average pairwise        correlation between pathway activation scores using an exhaustive computational        scheme for all combinations of replicates. In brief, we found that at least two        ONT replicates are required to obtain reproducible pathway scores for both        algorithms.

More than 23.8 million reads with mean read length of 790 bases and average        quality of 18.2 were generated. The annotation and subsequent filtering resulted        in the identification of 55,382 transcripts at 40,547 loci with mean length of        1,700 bases. We predicted 30,967 coding transcripts at 19,461 loci, and 16,495        lncRNA transcripts at 15,512 loci. Compared to existing reference annotations, we        found ∼52% of annotated transcripts could be partially or fully matched while        ∼47% were novel. Seventy percent of novel transcripts were potentially        transcribed from lncRNA loci. Based on our annotation, we quantified transcript        expression across tissues and found two brain tissues (i.e., cerebellum and        cortex) expressed the highest number of transcripts and loci. Furthermore, ∼22%        of the transcripts displayed tissue specificity with the reproductive tissues        (i.e., testis and ovary) exhibiting the most tissue-specific transcripts. Despite        our wide sampling, ∼20% of Ensembl reference loci were not detected. This        suggests that deeper sequencing and additional samples that include different        breeds, cell types, developmental stages, and physiological conditions, are        needed to fully annotate the chicken genome. The application of Nanopore        sequencing in this study demonstrates the usefulness of long-read data in        discovering additional novel loci (e.g., lncRNA loci) and resolving complex        transcripts (e.g., the longest transcript for the TTN locus).",8a1e204a0713e7abcf896cc4294d982318415155,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/8a1e204a0713e7abcf896cc4294d982318415155,36246588,PMC9561881,"background,methodology",False,Frontiers in genetics,101560621,0.13511791825294495,0.03389830508474576,5,4.772,0.4723618090452261,0.44221105527638194,0.191280627158023

Bracken with the standard database        performed best, the median percentage of reads across both sequencing platforms        identified correctly to the species level was 97.8% (IQR 92.7:99.0) [range        5:100]. For Kraken2 with a mini database, a commonly used combination, median        species-level identification was 86.4% (IQR 50.5:93.7) [range 4.3:100].        Classification performance varied by species, with Escherichia coli being more        challenging to classify correctly (probability of reads being assigned to the        correct species: 56.1-96.0%, varying by tool used). Human read misclassification        was negligible.

In the case of crop species, previous        research aimed to elucidate the changing patterns of repetitive sequences,        single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), and small InDels during domestication to        explain morphological evolution and adaptation to different environments.        Additionally, structural variations (SVs) encompassing larger stretches of DNA        are more likely to alter gene expression levels leading to phenotypic variation        affecting plant phenotypes and stress resistance. Previous studies on SVs in rice        were hampered by reliance on short-read sequencing limiting the quantity and        quality of SV identification, while SV data are currently only available for        cultivated rice, with wild rice largely uncharacterized. Here, we generated two        genome assemblies for O. rufipogon using long-read sequencing and provide        insights on the evolutionary pattern and effect of SVs on morphological traits        during rice domestication. RESULTS: In this study, we identified 318,589 SVs in        cultivated and wild rice populations through a comprehensive analysis of 13        high-quality rice genomes and found that wild rice genomes contain 49% of unique        SVs and an average of 1.76% of genes were lost during rice domestication. These        SVs were further genotyped for 649 rice accessions, their evolutionary pattern        during rice domestication and potential association with the diversity of        important agronomic traits were examined. Genome-wide association studies between        these SVs and nine agronomic traits identified 413 candidate causal variants,        which together affect 361 genes. An 824-bp deletion in japonica rice, which        encodes a serine carboxypeptidase family protein, is shown to be associated with        grain length. CONCLUSIONS: We provide relatively accurate and complete SV        datasets for cultivated and wild rice accessions, especially in TE-rich regions,        by comparing long-read sequencing data for 13 representative varieties.

Recent advances in nanopore long-read sequencing with circRNA        enrichment bring an unprecedented opportunity for investigating the issues. Here,        we developed FL-circAS (https://cosbi.ee.ncku.edu.tw/FL-circAS/), which collected        such long-read sequencing data of 20 cell lines/tissues and thereby identified        884 636 BSJs with 1 853 692 full-length circRNA isoforms in human and 115 173        BSJs with 135 617 full-length circRNA isoforms in mouse.

Here, we present a comprehensive summary of important applications of        these technologies in cancer research, including the identification of complex        structure variants, alternatively spliced isoforms, fusion transcript events, and        exogenous RNA. Furthermore, we discuss the impact of the newly developed nanopore        direct RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) approach in advancing epitranscriptome research        in cancer. Although the unique challenges still present for these new        single-molecule long-read methods, they will unravel many aspects of cancer        genome complexity in unprecedented ways and present an encouraging outlook for        continued application in an increasing number of different cancer research        settings.",f3da3c9cd235f150cf834f8519d6c8cc265f2bce,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/f3da3c9cd235f150cf834f8519d6c8cc265f2bce,37724303,PMC10388785,methodology,False,Medical review (2021),9918383871606676,0.12421301752328873,0.2079207920792079,7,0.0,0.5376884422110553,0.09045226130653267,0.21465332761630798

The        long-range information in the multi-end reads is beneficial in phasing        complicated spliced isoforms, but assembly algorithms that leverage such        information are lacking. Here we introduce Scallop2, a reference-based assembler        optimized for multi-end RNA-seq data. The algorithmic core of Scallop2 consists        of three steps: (1) using an algorithm to ""bridge"" multi-end reads into        single-end phasing paths in the context of a splice graph, (2) employing a method        to refine erroneous splice graphs by utilizing multi-end reads that fail to        bridge, and (3) piping the refined splice graph and the bridged phasing paths        into an algorithm that integrates multiple phase-preserving decompositions.

Carrier screening is        essential to facilitate prenatal counseling and testing. However, when        individuals with elevated HbA2 do not have an identifiable HBB disease-associated        variant, there is ambiguity on risk to their offspring. METHODS: We describe a        case report of a proband with elevated HbA2, no identifiable HBB        disease-associated variant, whose partner was a beta thalassemia carrier. Through        clinical HBB gene sequencing, multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification        (MLPA) analysis, as well as targeted Nanopore long read sequencing of selected        genes, we performed a complete analysis of HBB including the promoter region,        5'UTR and coding gene sequence, as well as evaluation for potential modifier        variants and other rare structural variants. RESULTS: This process identified        that the proband was heterozygous for KLF1:c.544T>C (p.Phe182Leu), a potential        functional polymorphism previously known to be associated with benign elevated        HbA2 levels.

10.1093/hmg/ddab209,Discovery of genomic variation across a generation.,2021.0,"Over the past 30 years (the timespan of a generation), advances in genomics        technologies have revealed tremendous and unexpected variation in the human        genome and have provided increasingly accurate answers to long-standing questions        of how much genetic variation exists in human populations and to what degree the        DNA complement changes between parents and offspring. Tracking the        characteristics of these inherited and spontaneous (or de novo) variations has        been the basis of the study of human genetic disease. From genome-wide microarray        and next-generation sequencing scans, we now know that each human genome contains        over 3 million single nucleotide variants when compared with the ~ 3 billion base        pairs in the human reference genome, along with roughly an order of magnitude        more DNA-approximately 30 megabase pairs (Mb)-being 'structurally variable',        mostly in the form of indels and copy number changes. Additional large-scale        variations include balanced inversions (average of 18 Mb) and complex,        difficult-to-resolve alterations. Collectively, ~1% of an individual's genome        will differ from the human reference sequence. When comparing across a        generation, fewer than 100 new genetic variants are typically detected in the        euchromatic portion of a child's genome. Driven by increasingly higher-resolution        and higher-throughput sequencing technologies, newer and more accurate databases        of genetic variation (for instance, more comprehensive structural variation data        and phasing of combinations of variants along chromosomes) of worldwide        populations will emerge to underpin the next era of discovery in human molecular        genetics.",8be8fa383aac930ebc57a829b54f2ea27c1963dd,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/8be8fa383aac930ebc57a829b54f2ea27c1963dd,34296264,PMC8490016,,False,Human molecular genetics,9208958,0.12023206055164337,0.023121387283236993,8,5.121,0.5829145728643216,0.542713567839196,0.21416239418431543

Genomics-assisted aquaculture can        increase yield while preserving the environment to ensure sufficient and        sustainable production for global food security. However, only few high-quality        genome sequences of marine organisms, especially shellfish, are available to the        public partly because of the difficulty in the sequence assembly due to the        complex nature of their genomes. A key step for a successful genome sequencing is        the preparation of high-quality high molecular weight (HMW) genomic DNA. This        study evaluated the effectiveness of five DNA extraction protocols (CTAB,        Genomic-tip, Mollusc DNA, TIANamp Marine Animals DNA, and Sbeadex livestock kits)        in obtaining shrimp HMW DNA for a long-read sequencing platform. DNA samples were        assessed for quality and quantity using a Qubit fluorometer, NanoDrop        spectrophotometer and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. Among the five extraction        methods examined without further optimization, the Genomic-tip kit yielded        genomic DNA with the highest quality. However, further modifications of these        established protocols might yield even better DNA quality and quantity. To        further investigate whether the obtained genomic DNA could be used in a long-read        sequencing application, DNA samples from the top three extraction methods (CTAB        method, Genomic-tip and Mollusc DNA kits) were used for Pacific Biosciences        (PacBio) library construction and sequencing. Genomic DNA obtained from        Genomic-tip and Mollusc DNA kits allowed successful library construction, while        the DNA obtained from the CTAB method did not. Genomic DNA isolated using the        Genomic-tip kit yielded a higher number of long reads (N50 of 14.57 Kb) than        those obtained from Mollusc DNA kits (N50 of 9.74 Kb). Thus, this study        identified an effective extraction method for high-quality HMW genomic DNA of        shrimp that can be applied to other marine organisms for a long-read sequencing        platform.",39cf2660209dc99e3287559b2d5da45df98c8fa5,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/39cf2660209dc99e3287559b2d5da45df98c8fa5,33240651,PMC7668203,,False,PeerJ,101603425,0.11858908832073212,0.018518518518518517,16,3.061,0.7386934673366834,0.19597989949748743,0.18318513892875266
10.1002/aps3.11533,Welcome to the big leaves: Best practices for improving genome annotation in        non-model plant genomes.,2023.0,"PREMISE: Robust standards to evaluate quality and completeness are lacking in        eukaryotic structural genome annotation, as genome annotation software is        developed using model organisms and typically lacks benchmarking to        comprehensively evaluate the quality and accuracy of the final predictions. The        annotation of plant genomes is particularly challenging due to their large sizes,        abundant transposable elements, and variable ploidies. This study investigates        the impact of genome quality, complexity, sequence read input, and method on        protein-coding gene predictions. METHODS: The impact of repeat masking, long-read        and short-read inputs, and de novo and genome-guided protein evidence was        examined in the context of the popular BRAKER and MAKER workflows for five plant        genomes. The annotations were benchmarked for structural traits and sequence        similarity. RESULTS: Benchmarks that reflect gene structures, reciprocal        similarity search alignments, and mono-exonic/multi-exonic gene counts provide a        more complete view of annotation accuracy. Transcripts derived from RNA-read        alignments alone are not sufficient for genome annotation. Gene prediction        workflows that combine evidence-based and ab initio approaches are recommended,        and a combination of short and long reads can improve genome annotation. Adding        protein evidence from de novo assemblies, genome-guided transcriptome assemblies,        or full-length proteins from OrthoDB generates more putative false positives as        implemented in the current workflows. Post-processing with functional and        structural filters is highly recommended. DISCUSSION: While the annotation of        non-model plant genomes remains complex, this study provides recommendations for        inputs and methodological approaches.

However, splicing variants and full-length sequence heterogeneity cannot be        characterized at spatial resolution with current transcriptome profiling methods.        To that end, we introduce spatial isoform transcriptomics (SiT), an explorative        method for characterizing spatial isoform variation and sequence heterogeneity        using long-read sequencing. We show in mouse brain how SiT can be used to profile        isoform expression and sequence heterogeneity in different areas of the tissue.        SiT reveals regional isoform switching of Plp1 gene between different layers of        the olfactory bulb, and the use of external single-cell data allows the        nomination of cell types expressing each isoform. Furthermore, SiT identifies        differential isoform usage for several major genes implicated in brain function        (Snap25, Bin1, Gnas) that are independently validated by in situ sequencing.

These assemblies were created using a range of        sequencing and computational approaches, with only limited comparisons described        among subsets of the assemblies. Here we present 3 high-quality de novo reference        assemblies based upon Oxford Nanopore long-read sequencing: 2 Bernese Mountain        Dogs (BD & OD) and a Cairn terrier (CA611). These breeds are of particular        interest due to the enrichment of unresolved genetic disorders.

However, genome-scale TELL-Seq is not        cost-effective for applications focusing on a single locus or a few loci. Here,        we present an optimized TELL-Seq protocol that enables the cost-effective phasing        of enriched loci (targets) of varying sizes, purity levels, and heterozygosity.        Targeted TELL-Seq maximizes linked-read efficiency and library yield while        minimizing input requirements, fragment collisions on microbeads, and sequencing        burden. To validate the targeted protocol, we phased seven 180-200 kb loci        enriched by CRISPR/Cas9-mediated excision coupled with pulse-field        electrophoresis, four 20 kb loci enriched by CRISPR/Cas9-mediated protection from        exonuclease digestion, and six 2-13 kb loci amplified by PCR. The selected        targets have clinical and research relevance (BRCA1, BRCA2, MLH1, MSH2, MSH6,        APC, PMS2, SCN5A-SCN10A, and PKI3CA). These analyses reveal that targeted        TELL-Seq provides a reliable way of phasing allelic variants within targets        (2-200 kb in length) with the low cost and high accuracy of short-read        sequencing.",32ce6bbd533c1d21561503b8643fe925ba5c20c9,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/32ce6bbd533c1d21561503b8643fe925ba5c20c9,36945366,PMC10028795,,False,bioRxiv : the preprint server for biology,101680187,0.11696558445692062,0.05555555555555555,0,0.0,0.06030150753768844,0.10552763819095477,0.0821862694185949

The existence of long cell-free DNA        molecules has been poorly explored. In this study, we demonstrated that        single-molecule real-time sequencing allowed us to detect and analyze a        substantial proportion of long DNA molecules from both fetal and maternal sources        in maternal plasma. Such molecules were beyond the size detection limits of        short-read sequencing technologies. The proportions of long cell-free DNA        molecules in maternal plasma over 500 bp were 15.5%, 19.8%, and 32.3% for the        first, second, and third trimesters, respectively. The longest fetal-derived        plasma DNA molecule observed was 23,635 bp. Long plasma DNA molecules        demonstrated predominance of A or G 5' fragment ends. Pregnancies with        preeclampsia demonstrated a reduction in long maternal plasma DNA molecules,        reduced frequencies for selected 5' 4-mer end motifs ending with G or A, and        increased frequencies for selected motifs ending with T or C. Finally, we have        developed an approach that employs the analysis of methylation patterns of the        series of CpG sites on a long DNA molecule for determining its tissue origin.        This approach achieved an area under the curve of 0.88 in differentiating between        fetal and maternal plasma DNA molecules, enabling the determination of maternal        inheritance and recombination events in the fetal genome. This work opens up        potential clinical utilities of long cell-free DNA analysis in maternal plasma        including noninvasive prenatal testing of monogenic diseases and        detection/monitoring of pregnancy-associated disorders such as preeclampsia.",b610e2c331863e7e095990908479a2f4af05e70e,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/b610e2c331863e7e095990908479a2f4af05e70e,34873045,PMC8685924,,False,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,0.11656273901462555,0.024390243902439025,42,12.779,0.9095477386934674,0.8693467336683417,0.3115590901196346

Sequencing approaches that rely on HMW DNA have been limited        to larger organisms or pools of multiple individuals, but recent advances have        allowed for sequencing from individuals of small-bodied organisms. Here, we use        HMW DNA sequencing with PacBio long reads and TELL-Seq linked reads to assemble        and annotate the genome from a single individual feather louse (Brueelia        nebulosa) from a European Starling (Sturnus vulgaris). We assembled a genome with        a relatively high scaffold N50 (637 kb) and with BUSCO scores (96.1%) comparable        to louse genomes assembled from pooled individuals. We annotated a number of        genes (10,938) similar to the human louse (Pediculus humanus) genome.        Additionally, calling phased variants revealed that the Brueelia genome is more        heterozygous (∼1%) then expected for a highly obligate and dispersal-limited        parasite.

Three out of        nine samples were sequenced directly from blood culture, and one sample was        sequenced from a mixed-blood culture. For genome assembly, several long-read,        (Canu, Flye, Unicycler, and Miniasm), short-read (ABySS, Unicycler and SPAdes)        and hybrid assemblers (Unicycler, hybridSPAdes, and MaSurCa) were tested.        Assembled genomes from the best-performing assemblers (according to quality        checks using QUAST and BUSCO) were subjected to downstream analyses. Flye and        Unicycler assemblers performed best for the assembly of long and short reads,        respectively. For hybrid assembly, Unicycler was the top-performing assembler and        produced more circularized and complete genome assemblies. Hybrid assembled        genomes performed substantially better in downstream analyses to predict putative        plasmids, AMR genes and β-lactamase gene variants, compared to MinION and        Illumina assemblies. Thus, hybrid assembly has the potential to reveal factors        related to microbial pathogenicity in clinical and mixed samples.",a202b1d81f6a1984dd76aab354dba183531435cf,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/a202b1d81f6a1984dd76aab354dba183531435cf,34946161,PMC8704702,background,False,Microorganisms,101625893,0.10894504189491272,0.11666666666666667,26,4.926,0.8442211055276382,0.507537688442211,0.28211399833061784

While many of the variants are        neutral, some can lead to higher transmissibility or virulence. Accurate assembly        of complete viral genomes enables the identification of underlying variants,        which are essential for studying virus evolution and elucidating the relationship        between genotypes and virus properties. Recently, third-generation sequencing        platforms such as Nanopore sequencers have been used for real-time virus        sequencing for Ebola, Zika, coronavirus disease 2019, etc. However, their high        per-base error rate prevents the accurate reconstruction of the viral genome.        RESULTS: In this work, we introduce a new tool, AccuVIR, for viral genome        assembly and polishing using error-prone long reads. It can better distinguish        sequencing errors from true variants based on the key observation that sequencing        errors can disrupt the gene structures of viruses, which usually have a high        density of coding regions. Our experimental results on both simulated and real        third-generation sequencing data demonstrated its superior performance on        generating more accurate viral genomes than generic assembly or polish tools.

The aim of        this study was to examine the structure of the oral microbiome by using different        sequencing technologies. Material and Methods. Five preschool children with no        symptoms of oral and systemic diseases were recruited. Samples of saliva were        collected. A 468 bp insert size library was constructed on the MiSeq platform and        then subjected to 300 bp paired-end sequencing. Libraries with longer insert        sizes, including a full-length 16S rDNA gene, were sequenced on the PacBio RS II        platform. RESULTS: A total of 122.6 Mb of raw data, including 244,967        high-quality sequences, were generated by the MiSeq platform, while 134.6 Mb of        raw data, including 70,030 high-quality reads, were generated by the PacBio RS II        platform. Clustering of the unique sequences into OTUs at 3% dissimilarity        resulted in an average of 225 OTUs on the MiSeq platform; however, the number of        OTUs generated on the PacBio RS II platform was 449, far greater than the number        of OTUs generated on the MiSeq platform.

However, no consensus        exists regarding the optimal diagnostic care pathway to adopt after negative        results with standard approaches. Methods: In 15 unsolved individuals clinically        diagnosed with recognizable OMIM diseases but with negative or inconclusive        first-line genetic results, we explored the utility of a multi-step approach        using several novel omics technologies to establish a molecular diagnosis.        Inclusion criteria included a clinical autosomal recessive disease diagnosis and        single heterozygous pathogenic variant in the gene of interest identified by        first-line analysis (60%-9/15) or a clinical diagnosis of an X-linked recessive        or autosomal dominant disease with no causative variant identified (40%-6/15).

Here, we assess the performance of different        methylation-calling tools to provide a systematic evaluation to guide researchers        performing human epigenome-wide studies. RESULTS: We compare seven analytic tools        for detecting DNA methylation from nanopore long-read sequencing data generated        from human natural DNA at a whole-genome scale. We evaluate the per-read and        per-site performance of CpG methylation prediction across different genomic        contexts, CpG site coverage, and computational resources consumed by each tool.        The seven tools exhibit different performances across the evaluation criteria. We        show that the methylation prediction at regions with discordant DNA methylation        patterns, intergenic regions, low CG density regions, and repetitive regions show        room for improvement across all tools. Furthermore, we demonstrate that 5hmC        levels at least partly contribute to the discrepancy between bisulfite and        nanopore sequencing.

Short-read RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) is a widely used strategy to        identify circRNAs. However, an inherent limitation of short-read RNA-seq is that        it does not experimentally determine the full-length sequences and exact exonic        compositions of circRNAs. Here, we report isoCirc, a strategy for sequencing        full-length circRNA isoforms, using rolling circle amplification followed by        nanopore long-read sequencing. We describe an integrated computational pipeline        to reliably characterize full-length circRNA isoforms using isoCirc data. Using        isoCirc, we generate a comprehensive catalog of 107,147 full-length circRNA        isoforms across 12 human tissues and one human cell line (HEK293), including        40,628 isoforms ≥500 nt in length.

The use of        second-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies has led to protocols based on the        amplification of one or a few hypervariable regions, impacting the outcome of the        analysis. Nowadays, comparative studies are necessary to assess different        amplicon-based approaches, including the full-locus sequencing currently feasible        thanks to third-generation sequencing (TGS) technologies. This study compared        three different methods to achieve the deepest microbiome taxonomic        characterization: (a) the single-region approach, (b) the multiplex approach,        covering several regions of the target gene/region, both based on NGS short        reads, and (c) the full-length approach, which analyzes the whole length of the        target gene thanks to TGS long reads. Analyses carried out on benchmark        microbiome samples, with a known taxonomic composition, highlighted a different        classification performance, strongly associated with the type of hypervariable        regions and the coverage of the target gene. Indeed, the full-length approach        showed the greatest discriminating power, up to species level, also on complex        real samples.

Despite        advancements in genetics and genomics technologies as well as increased        understanding of genomic function and dysfunction, many genetic diseases continue        to be difficult to diagnose. The goal of this Review is to increase the        familiarity of genetic testing strategies for non-genetics providers. As genetic        testing is increasingly used in primary care, many subspecialty clinics, and        various inpatient settings, it is important that non-genetics providers have a        fundamental understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of various genetic        testing strategies as well as develop an ability to interpret genetic testing        results.

However, the initial investment for acquiring next-generation        sequencing platforms and the need for bioinformatic skills represented an        obstacle for the widespread use of WGS. Long-reading technologies, such as the        one developed by Oxford Nanopore Technologies, can be easily implemented with a        minor initial investment and with simple protocols that can be performed with        basic laboratory equipment. METHODS: Herein, we report a simple MinION        Galaxy-based workflow with analysis parameters that allow its implementation in        food safety laboratories with limited computer resources and without previous        knowledge in bioinformatics for rapid Salmonella serotyping, virulence, and        identification of antimicrobial resistance genes. For that purpose, the single        use Flongle flow cells, along with the MinION Mk1B for WGS, and the        community-driven web-based analysis platform Galaxy for bioinformatic analysis        was used.

The genetic        diagnosis of inherited diseases, including TSC, in the clinical field is        widespread using next-generation sequencing. The mutations in protein-coding exon        tend to be verified because mutations directly cause abnormal protein. However,        it is relatively difficult to verify mutations in the intron region because it is        required to investigate whether the intron mutations affect the abnormal splicing        of transcripts. In this study, we developed a target-capture full-length        double-stranded cDNA sequencing method using Nanopore long-read sequencer        (Nanopore long-read target sequencing). This method revealed the occurrence of        intron mutation in the TSC2 gene and found that the intron mutation produces        novel intron retention splicing transcripts that generate truncated proteins. The        protein-coding transcripts were decreased due to the expression of the novel        intron retention transcripts, which caused TSC in patients with the intron        mutation.

In the absence of a sequenced genome to        guide the reconstruction process, the transcriptome must be assembled de novo        using only the information available in the RNA-seq reads. Subsequently, the        sequences must be annotated in order to identify sequence-intrinsic and        evolutionary features in them (for example, protein-coding regions).

10.1136/jmedgenet-2022-108588,The role of single-cell genomics in human genetics.,2022.0,"Single-cell sequencing is a powerful approach that can detect genetic alterations        and their phenotypic consequences in the context of human development, with        cellular resolution. Humans start out as single-cell zygotes and undergo fission        and differentiation to develop into multicellular organisms. Before fertilisation        and during development, the cellular genome acquires hundreds of mutations that        propagate down the cell lineage. Whether germline or somatic in nature, some of        these mutations may have significant genotypic impact and lead to diseased        cellular phenotypes, either systemically or confined to a tissue. Single-cell        sequencing enables the detection and monitoring of the genotype and the        consequent molecular phenotypes at a cellular resolution. It offers powerful        tools to compare the cellular lineage between 'normal' and 'diseased' conditions        and to establish genotype-phenotype relationships. By preserving cellular        heterogeneity, single-cell sequencing, unlike bulk-sequencing, allows the        detection of even small, diseased subpopulations of cells within an otherwise        normal tissue. Indeed, the characterisation of biopsies with cellular resolution        can provide a mechanistic view of the disease. While single-cell approaches are        currently used mainly in basic research, it can be expected that applications of        these technologies in the clinic may aid the detection, diagnosis and eventually        the treatment of rare genetic diseases as well as cancer. This review article        provides an overview of the single-cell sequencing technologies in the context of        human genetics, with an aim to empower clinicians to understand and interpret the        single-cell sequencing data and analyses. We discuss the state-of-the-art        experimental and analytical workflows and highlight current        challenges/limitations. Notably, we focus on two prospective applications of the        technology in human genetics, namely the annotation of the non-coding genome        using single-cell functional genomics and the use of single-cell sequencing data        for in silico variant prioritisation.",277eb06e740f9ee1ffafba493532c1257b76bcbb,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/277eb06e740f9ee1ffafba493532c1257b76bcbb,35790352,PMC9411920,,False,Journal of medical genetics,2985087R,0.09009299427270889,0.0,11,0.0,0.6582914572864321,0.135678391959799,0.14612337566874734

RNA-seq analysis enables genes and their corresponding transcripts        to be probed for a variety of purposes, such as detecting novel exons or whole        transcripts, assessing expression of genes and alternative transcripts, and        studying alternative splicing structure. It can be a challenge, however, to        obtain meaningful biological signals from raw RNA-seq data because of the        enormous scale of the data as well as the inherent limitations of different        sequencing technologies, such as amplification bias or biases of library        preparation. The need to overcome these technical challenges has pushed the rapid        development of novel computational tools, which have evolved and diversified in        accordance with technological advancements, leading to the current myriad of        RNA-seq tools. These tools, combined with the diverse computational skill sets of        biomedical researchers, help to unlock the full potential of RNA-seq.

Human        genetic variation associated with severe forms of cardiomyopathy and arrhythmias        has highlighted the crucial role of alternative splicing in myocardial health and        disease, given that it determines which mature RNA transcripts drive the        mechanical, structural, signalling and metabolic properties of the heart. In this        Review, we discuss how the analysis of cardiac isoform expression has been        facilitated by technical advances in multiomics and long-read and single-cell        sequencing technologies. The resulting insights into the regulation of        alternative splicing - including the identification of cardiac splice regulators        as therapeutic targets and the development of a translational pipeline to        evaluate splice modulators in human engineered heart tissue, animal models and        clinical trials - provide a basis for improved diagnosis and therapy.

Although the main BRCA1 protein is well characterized, further proteomics studies        have already identified additional BRCA1 isoforms with lower molecular weights.        However, the accurate nucleotide sequence determination of their corresponding        mRNAs is still a barrier, mainly due to the increased mRNA length of BRCA1 (~5.5        kb) and the limitations of the already implemented sequencing approaches. In the        present study, we designed and employed a multiplexed hybrid sequencing approach        (Hybrid-seq), based on nanopore and semi-conductor sequencing, aiming to detect        BRCA1 alternative transcripts in a panel of human cancer and non-cancerous cell        lines. The implementation of the described Hybrid-seq approach led to the        generation of highly accurate long sequencing reads that enabled the        identification of a wide spectrum of BRCA1 splice variants (BRCA1 sv.7 - sv.52),        thus deciphering the transcriptional landscape of the human BRCA1 gene. In        addition, demultiplexing of the sequencing data unveiled the expression profile        and abundance of the described BRCA1 mRNAs in breast, ovarian, prostate,        colorectal, lung and brain cancer as well as in non-cancerous human cell lines.        Finally, in silico analysis supports that multiple detected mRNAs harbour open        reading frames, being highly expected to encode putative protein isoforms with        conserved domains, thus providing new insights into the complex roles of BRCA1 in        genomic stability and DNA damage repair.",59cea7c14eb846c593d72ad97fd8e500cb6ebebd,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/59cea7c14eb846c593d72ad97fd8e500cb6ebebd,37272060,PMC10243389,background,False,RNA biology,101235328,0.08647765219211578,0.02857142857142857,0,4.766,0.10552763819095477,0.4120603015075377,0.11501005804098002

Features such as the transcriptome, methylome, proteome,        histone post-translational modifications and the microbiome all influence the        host response to various diseases and cancers. Each of these platforms have        technological limitations due to sample preparation steps, amount of material        needed for sequencing, and sequencing depth requirements. These features provide        a snapshot of one level of regulation in a system. The obvious next step is to        integrate this information and learn how genes, proteins, and/or epigenetic        factors influence the phenotype of a disease in context of the system. In recent        years, there has been a push for the development of data integration methods.

With policy directed towards achieving        global PPR eradication, the establishment of cost-effective genomic surveillance        tools is critical where PPR is endemic. Genomic data can provide sufficient        in-depth information to identify the pockets of endemicity responsible for PPRV        persistence and viral evolution, and direct an appropriate vaccination response.        Yet, access to the required sequencing technology is low in resource-limited        settings and is compounded by the difficulty of transporting clinical samples        from wildlife across international borders due to the Convention on International        Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) of Wild Fauna and Flora, and Nagoya Protocol        regulations. Oxford nanopore MinION sequencing technology has recently        demonstrated an extraordinary performance in the sequencing of PPRV due to its        rapidity, utility in endemic countries and comparatively low cost per sample when        compared to other whole-genome (WGS) sequencing platforms. In the present study,        Oxford nanopore MinION sequencing was utilised to generate complete genomes of        PPRV isolates collected from infected goats in Ngorongoro and Momba districts in        the northern and southern highlands of Tanzania during 2016 and 2018,        respectively. The tiling multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was carried        out with twenty-five pairs of long-read primers. The resulting PCR amplicons were        used for nanopore library preparation and sequencing. The analysis of output data        was complete genomes of PPRV, produced within four hours of sequencing (accession        numbers: MW960272 and MZ322753). Phylogenetic analysis of the complete genomes        revealed a high nucleotide identity, between 96.19 and 99.24% with lineage III        PPRV currently circulating in East Africa, indicating a common origin. The Oxford        nanopore MinION sequencer can be deployed to overcome diagnostic and surveillance        challenges in the PPR Global Control and Eradication program. However, the        coverage depth was uneven across the genome and amplicon dropout was observed        mainly in the GC-rich region between the matrix (M) and fusion (F) genes of PPRV.

Resolving these allelic differences by chromosomal copy, also known as phasing,        is achievable on a short-read sequencer when using a library preparation method        that captures long-range genomic information. TELL-Seq is a library preparation        that captures long-range genomic information with the aid of molecular        identifiers (barcodes). The same barcode is used to tag the reads derived from        the same long DNA fragment within a range of up to 200 kilobases (kb), generating        linked-reads.

In this        study, we aimed to evaluate different methods for host DNA depletion and/or        microbial DNA enrichment and assess the use of PCR-based whole genome        amplification in milk samples with high somatic cell count (SCC) by using short-        and long-read sequencing technologies. Our results evidenced that DNA extraction        performed differently in terms of host DNA removal, impacting metagenome        composition and functional profiles.. Moreover, the ratio of SCC/bacteria        ultimately impacts microbial DNA yield, and samples with low SCC (SCC below        100,000 cells/mL) are the most problematic. When milk samples with high SCC (SCC        above 200,000 cells/mL) underwent multiple-displacement amplification (MDA), we        successfully recovered high-quality metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs), and        long-read sequencing was feasible even for samples with low DNA concentration. By        associating MDA and short-read sequencing, we recovered two times more MAGs than        in untreated samples, and an ongoing co-infection not reported by traditional        methods was detected for mastitis pathogen. Overall, this new approach will        improve the detection of mastitis-associated microorganisms and make it possible        to examine host-microbiome interactions in bovine        mastitis.IMPORTANCENext-generation sequencing technologies have been widely used        to gain new insights into the diversity of the microbial community of milk        samples and dairy products for different purposes such as microbial safety,        profiling of starter cultures, and host-microbiome interactions. Milk is a        complex food matrix, and additionally, the presence of host nucleic acid        sequences is considered a contaminant in untargeted high-throughput sequencing        studies. Therefore, genomic-centric metagenomic studies of milk samples focusing        on the health-disease status in dairy cattle are still scarce, which makes it        difficult to evaluate the microbial ecophysiology of bovine hindmilk. This study        provides an alternative method for genome-centric metagenome studies applied to        hindmilk samples with high somatic cell content, which is indispensable to        examining host-microbiome interactions in bovine mastitis.",0ad0685c7813a908b1a819101363e671795d9de4,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0ad0685c7813a908b1a819101363e671795d9de4,38054728,PMC10826364,background,False,mSphere,101674533,0.0832919254899025,0.01282051282051282,0,5.029,0.12060301507537688,0.5326633165829145,0.12810573252391957

Given the extent of ethno-geographic diversity and the consequent diversity in        clinical manifestations of these variations, population specific references were        developed overtime. The dramatically plummeting cost of sequencing whole genomes        and the advent of third generation long range sequencers allowing accurate, error        free, telomere-to-telomere assemblies of human genomes present us with a unique        and unprecedented opportunity to develop a more composite standard reference        consisting of a collection of multiple genomes that capture the maximal variation        existing in the population, with the deepest annotation possible, enabling a        realistic, reliable and actionable estimation of clinical significance of        specific variations. The Human Pangenome Project thus is a logical next step        promising a more accurate and global representation of genomic variations.

Although nanopore        sequencing has made significant progress in scientific research and clinical        practice, its application has been limited compared with next-generation        sequencing (NGS) due to specific design principle and data characteristics,        especially in hotspot mutation detection. Therefore, we developed Nano2NGS-Muta        as a data analysis framework for hotspot mutation detection based on long reads        from nanopore sequencing.

Unfortunately, while these studies have uncovered the importance of these        microbial communities to our health, they often do not result in similar        findings. One possible reason for the disagreement in these results is due to the        multitude of systemic biases that are introduced during sequence-based microbiome        studies. These biases begin with sample collection and continue to be introduced        throughout the entire experiment leading to an observed community that is        significantly altered from the true underlying microbial composition. In this        review, we will highlight the various steps in typical sequence-based human        microbiome studies where significant bias can be introduced, and we will review        the current efforts within the field that aim to reduce the impact of these        biases.

Recent advances in nanopore sequencing, as well as genome assembly        and analysis methods, have made it possible to obtain complete bacterial genomes        from metagenomic (i.e., multispecies) samples, including those from the human        microbiome. In this study, methods are presented to obtain complete bacterial        genomes from human saliva using complementary Oxford Nanopore (ONT) and Illumina        sequencing. Applied to 3 human saliva samples, these methods resulted in 11        complete bacterial genomes: 3 Saccharibacteria clade G6 (also known as Ca.        Nanogingivalaceae HMT-870), 1 Saccharibacteria clade G1 HMT-348, 2 Rothia        mucilaginosa, 2 Actinomyces graevenitzii, 1 Mogibacterium diversum, 1        Lachnospiraceae HMT-096, and 1 Lancefieldella parvula; and one circular        chromosome of Ruminococcaceae HMT-075 (which likely has at least 2 chromosomes).        The 4 Saccharibacteria genomes, as well as the Actinomyces graeventizii genomes,        represented the first complete genomes from their respective bacterial taxa.        Aside from the complete genomes, the assemblies contained 147 contigs of over        500,000 bp each and thousands of smaller contigs, together representing a myriad        of additional draft genomes including many which are likely nearly complete. The        complete genomes enabled highly accurate pangenome analysis, which identified        unique and missing features of each genome compared to its closest relatives with        complete genomes available in public repositories. These features provide clues        as to the lifestyle and ecological role of these bacteria within the human oral        microbiota, which will be particularly useful in designing future studies of the        taxa that have never been isolated or cultivated. IMPORTANCE Obtaining complete        and accurate genomes is crucial to the study of any organism. Previously,        obtaining complete genomes of bacteria, including those of the human microbiome,        frequently required isolation of the organism, as well as low-throughput, manual        sequencing methods to resolve repeat regions. Advancements in long-read        sequencing technologies, including Oxford Nanopore (ONT), have made it possible        to obtain complete, closed bacterial genomes from metagenomic samples. This study        reports methods to obtain complete genomes from the human oral microbiome using        complementary ONT and Illumina sequencing of saliva samples. Eleven complete        genomes were obtained from 3 human saliva samples, with genomes of        Saccharibacteria HMT-870, Saccharibacteria HMT-348, and Actinomyces graeventzii        being the first complete genomes from their respective taxa.

TRs are a common form of genetic variation        with biological consequences, observed, so far, in humans, dogs, plants, oysters,        and yeast. Repeat diseases show atypical clinical features, genetic anticipation,        and multiple and partially penetrant phenotypes among family members.

Phylogenomic methods to        test for the presence of hybridization come in many varieties and typically        operate by leveraging expected patterns of genealogical discordance in the        absence of hybridization. An important assumption made by these tests is that the        data (genes or SNPs) are independent given the species tree. However, when the        data are closely linked, it is especially important to consider their        nonindependence. Recently, deep learning techniques such as convolutional neural        networks (CNNs) have been used to perform population genetic inferences with        linked SNPs coded as binary images. Here, we use CNNs for selecting among        candidate hybridization scenarios using the tree topology (((P(1) , P(2) ), P(3)        ), Out) and a matrix of pairwise nucleotide divergence (d(XY) ) calculated in        windows across the genome. Using coalescent simulations to train and        independently test a neural network showed that our method, HyDe-CNN, was able to        accurately perform model selection for hybridization scenarios across a wide        breath of parameter space. We then used HyDe-CNN to test models of admixture in        Heliconius butterflies, as well as comparing it to phylogeny-based introgression        statistics.

To do so, we sequenced DNA from seven plasmid-rich bacterial        isolates in three different ways: ONT ligation, ONT rapid and Illumina. Using the        Illumina read depths to approximate true plasmid abundance, we found that small        plasmids (<20 kbp) were underrepresented in ONT ligation read sets (by a mean        factor of ~4) but were not underrepresented in ONT rapid read sets. This effect        correlated with plasmid size, with the smallest plasmids being the most        underrepresented in ONT ligation read sets. We also found lower rates of        chimaeric reads in the rapid read sets relative to ligation read sets.

We developed NanoSTR for detection of target STR loci based on the        length-number-rank (LNR) information of reads. NanoSTR can be used for STR        detection and genotyping based on long-read data from nanopore sequencing with        improved accuracy and efficiency compared with other existing methods, such as        Tandem-Genotypes and TRiCoLOR. NanoSTR showed 100% concordance with the expected        genotypes using error-free simulated data, and also achieved >85% concordance        using the standard samples (containing autosomal and Y-chromosomal loci) with        MinION sequencing platform, respectively. NanoSTR showed high performance for        detection of target STR markers. Although NanoSTR needs further optimization and        development, it is useful as an analytical method for the detection of STR loci        by nanopore sequencing. This method adds to the toolbox for nanopore-based STR        analysis and expands the applications of nanopore sequencing in scientific        research and clinical scenarios.

10.1186/s40104-021-00643-6,A review of the resistome within the digestive tract of livestock.,2021.0,"Antimicrobials have been widely used to prevent and treat infectious diseases and        promote growth in food-production animals. However, the occurrence of        antimicrobial resistance poses a huge threat to public and animal health,        especially in less developed countries where food-producing animals often        intermingle with humans. To limit the spread of antimicrobial resistance from        food-production animals to humans and the environment, it is essential to have a        comprehensive knowledge of the role of the resistome in antimicrobial resistance        (AMR), The resistome refers to the collection of all antimicrobial resistance        genes associated with microbiota in a given environment. The dense microbiota in        the digestive tract is known to harbour one of the most diverse resistomes in        nature. Studies of the resistome in the digestive tract of humans and animals are        increasing exponentially as a result of advancements in next-generation        sequencing and the expansion of bioinformatic resources/tools to identify and        describe the resistome. In this review, we outline the various        tools/bioinformatic pipelines currently available to characterize and understand        the nature of the intestinal resistome of swine, poultry, and ruminants. We then        propose future research directions including analysis of resistome using        long-read sequencing, investigation in the role of mobile genetic elements in the        expression, function and transmission of AMR. This review outlines the current        knowledge and approaches to studying the resistome in food-producing animals and        sheds light on future strategies to reduce antimicrobial usage and control the        spread of AMR both within and from livestock production systems.",ad42137398f873219abc0e4c198e32432b00a13f,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/ad42137398f873219abc0e4c198e32432b00a13f,34763729,PMC8588621,background,False,Journal of animal science and biotechnology,101581293,0.0762699693441391,0.00904977375565611,16,6.175,0.7437185929648241,0.678391959798995,0.23981748322007707
10.1089/hs.2022.0029,Managing the Transition to Widespread Metagenomic Monitoring: Policy        Considerations for Future Biosurveillance.,2023.0,"The technological possibilities and future public health importance of        metagenomic sequencing have received extensive attention, but there has been        little discussion about the policy and regulatory issues that need to be        addressed if metagenomic sequencing is adopted as a key technology for        biosurveillance. In this article, we introduce metagenomic monitoring as a        possible path to eventually replacing current infectious disease monitoring        models. Many key enablers are technological, whereas others are not. We therefore        highlight key policy challenges and implementation questions that need to be        addressed for ""widespread metagenomic monitoring"" to be possible. Policymakers        must address pitfalls like fragmentation of the technological base, private        capture of benefits, privacy concerns, the usefulness of the system during        nonpandemic times, and how the future systems will enable better response. If        these challenges are addressed, the technological and public health promise of        metagenomic sequencing can be realized.",a9737b6e9da851124def4837daada54483c0fea2,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/a9737b6e9da851124def4837daada54483c0fea2,36629860,PMC9940815,,False,Health security,101654694,0.07613247632980347,0.04854368932038835,2,3.074,0.2914572864321608,0.20603015075376885,0.11688033420498582
