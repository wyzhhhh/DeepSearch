Immunotherapy has emerged as a promising approach for enhancing the immune response against cancer, with a focus on increasing the efficiency of vaccines and cancer therapy. The development of recombinant human cytokines, such as IL-2, IL-12, IL-15, IL-21, GM-CSF, and INF-α, has been a significant area of investigation since the 1980s, showing potential in preclinical models of murine cancer. However, the limitations of cytokines, including short half-life and narrow therapeutic framework, have restricted their efficacy as monotherapy agents, with only IL-2 and IFN-α being approved by the FDA for anti-tumoral therapies.

The cancer immune cycle plays a pivotal role in initiating an anticancer T-cell response, involving the release of neo-antigens, antigen presentation, T-cell activation, migration to the tumor site, and killing of cancer cells. However, in cancer patients, this cycle often fails due to errors in various steps, including the detection of tumor antigens, inadequate T cell infiltration, and dominance of regulatory T cells over effector cells.

The goal of cancer immunotherapy is to establish a self-reliant cycle of cancer immunity while escaping negative feedback mechanisms in the tumor microenvironment. This involves addressing immunosuppression and negative feedback mechanisms, ensuring an effective immune response against tumor cells. The significance of research in this area lies in the potential to overcome the limitations of current immunotherapies and improve their efficacy in treating cancer, ultimately impacting patient outcomes.

Introduction:

The evolution of immunotherapy has revolutionized cancer treatment by leveraging the immune system to combat malignancies effectively. Efforts are focused on enhancing vaccines and cancer therapies through the development of recombinant human cytokines like IL-2, IL-12, IL-15, IL-21, GM-CSF, and INF-α, which have shown promise in murine cancer models. Despite their potential, the short half-life and limited therapeutic scope of cytokines have hindered their efficacy as standalone treatments, with only IL-2 and IFN-α currently approved by the FDA for anti-tumoral therapies.

In cancer patients, the cancer immune cycle, which orchestrates the anticancer T-cell response, often falters due to various errors, inhibiting proper detection of tumor antigens, impeding T-cell infiltration, and favoring regulatory T cells over effector cells. To address these challenges, research in cancer immunotherapy aims to establish a self-sustaining cycle of cancer immunity while circumventing negative feedback mechanisms in the tumor microenvironment. This necessitates overcoming immunosuppression and enhancing the immune response against tumor cells.

Furthermore, the intersection of biomarkers and immunotherapy is crucial in advancing cancer treatment efficacy. Biomarkers play a pivotal role in predicting patient responses to immunotherapy, thereby optimizing treatment outcomes and personalized medicine. Machine learning models are increasingly employed to analyze multi-omic cancer datasets, identifying significant biomarkers, enhancing the understanding of immunotherapy mechanisms, and streamlining decision-making processes.

The significance of identifying predictive biomarkers lies in tailoring immunotherapy to individual patient subsets, maximizing treatment effectiveness, and broadening its application across different cancer types. This review underscores the essential role of biomarkers in refining cancer care management, particularly in female breast cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and other malignancies, where immune checkpoint blockade therapy has shown promising but varying degrees of success.

Moreover, the amalgamation of nanomedicine and immunotherapy presents a new frontier in cancer treatment, with nanoparticles offering innovative strategies for tumor imaging, targeted drug delivery, and image-guided therapy. The development of predictive biomarkers in oncology, enhanced by nanotechnology, not only shifts traditional treatment paradigms but also underscores the potential for personalized, high-efficacy cancer treatments.

In conclusion, ongoing research in biomarkers for immunotherapy holds immense promise in overcoming the limitations of existing treatments, enhancing patient outcomes, and reducing healthcare costs. Continued advancements in this field are crucial for unlocking the full potential of immunotherapy in combatting cancer effectively and providing tailored, efficient treatment solutions.

Checkpoint inhibitors have demonstrated unprecedented rates of durable responses in some of the most difficult-to-treat cancers; however, many treated patients do not respond, and the potential for serious side effects exists. There is a growing need to identify biomarkers that will improve the selection of patients who will best respond to therapy, further elucidate drug mechanisms of action, and help tailor therapy regimens. Biomarkers are being explored at the soluble, cellular, and genomic levels, and examples in immunotherapy include serum proteins, tumor-specific receptor expression patterns, factors in the tumor microenvironment, circulating immune and tumor cells, and host genomic factors. The search for reliable biomarkers is limited by our incomplete understanding of how immunotherapies modify the already complex immune response to cancer, as well as the contribution of immuno-editing to a dynamic and inducible tumor microenvironment and immune milieu. Furthermore, there has been little extension of any candidate assay into large, prospective studies, and the lack of standardization in measurement and interpretation restricts their validity. Both tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes and PD-L1 expression within the tumor microenvironment have been recognized as having both prognostic and predictive value for patients treated with immunotherapy. Alternately, a larger panel of gene signatures, chemokines, and other factors that correlate with response has been proposed. In this article, we will explore the status of current biomarker candidates.Related paper titles: ['Informing immunotherapy with multi-omics driven machine learning.', 'Immuno-Oncology Biomarkers for Personalized Immunotherapy in Breast Cancer.', 'Rationale of Immunotherapy in Hepatocellular Carcinoma and Its Potential        Biomarkers.', 'Nanomedicine and Onco-Immunotherapy: From the Bench to Bedside to Biomarkers.']Related paper abstracts: ['Progress in sequencing technologies and clinical experiments has revolutionized        immunotherapy on solid and hematologic malignancies. However, the benefits of        immunotherapy are limited to specific patient subsets, posing challenges for        broader application. To improve its effectiveness, identifying biomarkers that        can predict patient response is crucial. Machine learning (ML) play a pivotal        role in harnessing multi-omic cancer datasets and unlocking new insights into        immunotherapy. This review provides an overview of cutting-edge ML models applied        in omics data for immunotherapy analysis, including immunotherapy response        prediction and immunotherapy-relevant tumor microenvironment identification. We        elucidate how ML leverages diverse data types to identify significant biomarkers,        enhance our understanding of immunotherapy mechanisms, and optimize        decision-making process. Additionally, we discuss current limitations and        challenges of ML in this rapidly evolving field. Finally, we outline future        directions aimed at overcoming these barriers and improving the efficiency of ML        in immunotherapy research.', 'The immune checkpoint blockade therapy has drastically advanced treatment of        different types of cancer over the past few years.

In this review we summarize the advances        done in the era of biomarker studies and highlight their link in supporting        breast cancer immunotherapy.', 'Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the most common type of liver cancer, is derived        mostly from a background of chronic inflammation. Multiple immunotherapeutic        strategies have been evaluated in HCC, with some degree of success, particularly        with immune checkpoint blockade (ICB).

In particular, immune checkpoint inhibitors are proved to be        unprecedentedly in increasing the overall survival rates of patients with        refractory cancers, such as advanced melanoma, non-small cell lung cancer, and        renal cell carcinoma. However, inhibitor therapies are only effective in a small        proportion of patients with problems, such as side effects and high costs.        Therefore, doctors urgently need reliable predictive biomarkers for checkpoint        inhibitor therapies to choose the optimal therapies.

To improve its effectiveness, identifying biomarkers that        can predict patient response is crucial.

Female breast cancer is the        second leading cause of death in the overall burden of cancers worldwide that is        encouraging healthcare professionals to improve cancer care management. The        checkpoint blockade therapies combined with novel agents become the recent focus        of various clinical trials in breast cancer.

Checkpoint inhibitors have demonstrated        unprecedented rates of durable responses in some of the most difficult-to-treat        cancers; however, many treated patients do not respond, and the potential for        serious side effects exists. There is a growing need to identify biomarkers that        will improve the selection of patients who will best respond to therapy, further        elucidate drug mechanisms of action, and help tailor therapy regimens. Biomarkers        are being explored at the soluble, cellular, and genomic levels, and examples in        immunotherapy include serum proteins, tumor-specific receptor expression        patterns, factors in the tumor microenvironment, circulating immune and tumor        cells, and host genomic factors. The search for reliable biomarkers is limited by        our incomplete understanding of how immunotherapies modify the already complex        immune response to cancer, as well as the contribution of immuno-editing to a        dynamic and inducible tumor microenvironment and immune milieu. Furthermore,        there has been little extension of any candidate assay into large, prospective        studies, and the lack of standardization in measurement and interpretation        restricts their validity. Both tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes and PD-L1        expression within the tumor microenvironment have been recognized as having both        prognostic and predictive value for patients treated with immunotherapy.        Alternately, a larger panel of gene signatures, chemokines, and other factors        that correlate with response has been proposed. In this article, we will explore        the status of current biomarker candidates.\n\nDOI: 10.1200/EDBK_160766\nThe impact factor: 0.0\n\n\n\nPaper 5\nTitle: Rationale of Immunotherapy in Hepatocellular Carcinoma and Its Potential        Biomarkers.\n\nAbstract: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the most common type of liver cancer, is derived        mostly from a background of chronic inflammation. Multiple immunotherapeutic        strategies have been evaluated in HCC, with some degree of success, particularly        with immune checkpoint blockade (ICB). Despite the initial enthusiasm, treatment        benefit is only appreciated in a modest proportion of patients (response rate to        single agent ~20%). Therapy-induced immune-related adverse events (irAEs) and        economic impact are pertinent considerations with ICB. It is imperative that a        deeper understanding of its mechanisms of action either as monotherapy or in        combination with other therapeutic agents is needed. We herein discuss the latest        developments in the immunotherapeutic approaches for HCC, the potential        predictive biomarkers., and the rationale for combination therapies. We also        outline promising future immunotherapeutic strategies for HCC patients.\n\nDOI: 10.3390/cancers11121926\nThe impact factor: 6.575\n\n\n\nPaper 6\nTitle: Nanomedicine and Onco-Immunotherapy: From the Bench to Bedside to Biomarkers.\n\nAbstract: The broad relationship between the immune system and cancer is opening a new        hallmark to explore for nanomedicine.

A        wide array of genome-wide expression profiles generated by gene perturbation have        been widely used to capture causal links between perturbed genes and response        genes. Through annotating >600 gene perturbation profiles, over 354,000 causal        relationships between perturbed genes and lncRNAs were identified. This        large-scale resource of causal relations inspired us to develop a novel        computational approach LnCAR for inferring lncRNAs\' functions, which showed a        higher accuracy than the co-expression based approach. By application of LnCAR to        the cancer hallmark processes, we identified 38 lncRNAs involved in distinct        carcinogenic processes. The "activating invasion & metastasis" related lncRNAs        were strongly associated with metastatic progression in various cancer types and        could act as a predictor of cancer metastasis. Meanwhile, the "evading immune        destruction" related lncRNAs showed significant associations with immune        infiltration of various immune cells and, importantly, can predict response to        anti-PD-1 immunotherapy, suggesting their potential roles as biomarkers for        immune therapy. Taken together, our approach provides a novel way to        systematically reveal functions of lncRNAs, which will be helpful for further        experimental exploration and clinical translational research of lncRNAs.\n\nDOI: 10.1016/j.ebiom.2018.08.050\nThe impact factor: 11.205\n\n\n\nPaper 8\nTitle: Immunotherapy for Colorectal Cancer: A Review of Current and Novel Therapeutic        Approaches.\n\nAbstract: Colorectal cancer (CRC) remains a leading cause of cancer-related deaths in the        United States. Although immunotherapy has dramatically changed the landscape of        treatment for many advanced cancers, the benefit in CRC has thus far been limited        to patients with microsatellite instability high (MSI-H):DNA mismatch        repair-deficient (dMMR) tumors. Recent studies in the refractory CRC setting have        led to US Food and Drug Administration approvals for pembrolizumab as well as        nivolumab (with or without ipilimumab) for tumors harboring an MSI-H:dMMR        molecular profile. Several randomized controlled trials are underway to move        immunotherapy into the frontline for metastatic cancer (with or without        chemotherapy) and the adjuvant setting. Awareness of these studies is critical        given the relatively low incidence (approximately 3%-5%) of MSI-H:dMMR in        advanced or metastatic CRC to support study completion, because the results could        be potentially practice changing. The real challenge in this disease is related        to demonstrating the benefit of immunotherapy for the vast majority of patients        with CRC not harboring MSI-H:dMMR. Given the rapid pace of scientific changes,        this article provides a narrative review regarding the current landscape of        immunotherapy for CRC. Particular attention is paid to the currently available        data that inform today\'s clinical practice along with upcoming randomized        controlled trials that may soon dramatically change the treatment landscape for        CRC.\n\nDOI: 10.1093/jnci/djz093\nThe impact factor: 11.816\n\n\n\nPaper 9\nTitle: Current status of immunotherapy and immune biomarkers in gastro-esophageal        cancers.\n\nAbstract: Gastroesophageal (GE) cancers continue to be a significant cause of mortality        globally. Despite therapeutic advances in oncology, the prognosis of advanced GE        cancer remains exceedingly poor. Immunotherapy has caused a major paradigm shift        in the field of oncology. Not all patients benefit from these agents and several        studies are trying to identify predictive and prognostic biomarkers to better        inform and guide treatment decisions. The potential role of immunotherapy in GE        cancers is emerging. These cancer types are molecularly and immunologically        heterogeneous, and this heterogeneity influences the tumor microenvironment        posing a significant challenge to studying biomarkers of response to        immunotherapy. Here in this article, we discuss the need for new therapeutic        approaches in GE cancers, review the emerging data on the activity of checkpoint        inhibitors and the role of biomarkers in this setting.\n\nDOI: 10.21037/jgo.2017.06.12\nThe impact factor: 2.587\n\n\n\nPaper 10\nTitle: Deciphering colorectal cancer immune microenvironment transcriptional landscape        on single cell resolution - A role for immunotherapy.\n\nAbstract: Single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) is a novel high-throughput technique that        enables the investigation of a single cell\'s entire transcriptome. It elucidates        intricate cellular networks and generates indices that will eventually enable the        development of more targeted and personalized medications. The importance of        scRNA-seq has been highlighted in complex biological systems such as cancer and        the immune system, which exhibit significant cellular heterogeneity. Colorectal        cancer (CRC) is the third most common type of cancer and the second leading cause        of cancer-related death globally. Chemotherapy continues to be used to treat        these patients. However, 5-FU has been utilized in chemotherapy regimens with        oxaliplatin and irinotecan since the 1960s and is still used today. Additionally,        chemotherapy-resistant metastatic CRCs with poor prognoses have been treated with        immunotherapy employing monoclonal antibodies, immune checkpoint inhibitors,        adoptive cell therapy and cancer vaccines. Personalized immunotherapy employing        tumor-specific neoantigens allows for treating each patient as a distinct group.        Sequencing and multi-omics approaches have helped us identify patients more        precisely in the last decade. The introduction of modern methods and        neoantigen-based immunotherapy may usher in a new era in treating CRC. The unmet        goal is to better understand the cellular and molecular mechanisms that        contribute to CRC pathogenesis and resistance to treatment, identify novel        therapeutic targets, and make more stratified and informed treatment decisions        using single cell approaches. This review summarizes current scRNA-seq        utilization in CRC research, examining its potential utility in the development        of precision immunotherapy for CRC.\n\nDOI: 10.3389/fimmu.2022.959705\nThe impact factor: 8.786\n\n\n\n'}/home/wangyz/anaconda3/envs/tavily/lib/python3.12/site-packages/langchain/document_transformers/__init__.py:30: LangChainDeprecationWarning: Importing document transformers from langchain is deprecated.

RNA splicing plays a crucial role in generating transcriptomic variations, and its misregulation is linked to various human diseases caused by genetic mutations. Over the past decade, RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) has transformed transcriptomics studies, enabling the quantitative measurement of isoform-specific gene expression and the detection of differential alternative splicing events. However, the use of short-read RNA-seq has been predominant due to its high coverage and single-nucleotide resolution. The emergence of long-read RNA-seq has enabled the discovery of complex novel isoforms and the quantification of isoform usage based on full-length sequenced fragments without amplification bias. Despite the advantages, there are still challenges associated with long-read RNA-seq data, particularly in terms of accuracy and throughput. The accurate characterization of transcripts using long reads remains difficult, and there are issues that can affect estimations, such as read coverage uniformity and sequencing error rates. The comparison of different long-read sequencing platforms, such as PacBio and ONT, suggests that ONT may be more promising in quantifying isoform expression due to its affordability and potential for higher read coverage. The study aims to address the limitations of long-read sequencing technologies, particularly in terms of accuracy and throughput, and presents a new approach, LIQA, which demonstrates high accuracy in profiling alternative splicing events. The significance of this research lies in its potential to improve the understanding of transcriptomic variations and contribute to the development of more robust and effective long-read RNA-seq data analysis methods.

RNA splicing plays a crucial role in generating transcriptomic variations, with its misregulation linked to various human diseases. Over the years, RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) has transformed transcriptomics studies by enabling the unbiased characterization of transcriptomic variations. While short-read RNA-seq has been the preferred method due to its high coverage and single-nucleotide resolution, its limited read length poses challenges in accurately characterizing transcripts. The emergence of long-read RNA-seq technologies has offered a solution by capturing full-length transcripts in each read. This advancement has facilitated the accurate estimation of isoform-specific gene expression, identification of novel transcript isoforms, and detection of differential alternative splicing (DAS) events. However, despite the advantages of long-read sequencing, challenges such as read length bias, low read quality, and throughput limitations persist. Addressing these limitations is crucial for enhancing the accuracy and throughput of long-read sequencing technologies, thereby enabling more robust transcriptomic analyses and furthering our understanding of alternative splicing events.

Long-read sequencing technologies have gained popularity in recent years due to their potential to overcome the limitations of fragmented short-read sequencing. Short-read RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) has been the method of choice for transcriptomics studies, but it faces challenges in accurately characterizing transcripts due to limited read length. This limitation results in biases and hinders the correct mapping of reads to the reference genome. As a consequence, transcriptome profiling using short-read RNA-seq is biased by read coverage heterogeneity across isoforms. In contrast, long-read RNA sequencing can sequence full-length transcripts, enabling the exploration of isoform-specific gene expression. 

Previous studies have utilized long-read sequencing technologies such as PacBio Iso-Seq, synthetic long-read MOLECULO methods, and Oxford Nanopore sequencing. The Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) MinION, for example, has been used to analyze both full-length cDNA samples and mRNA samples derived from tissue cells. Nanopore sequencing has the advantage of generating reads as long as 2 Mbp, allowing for the sequencing of a large portion or the entire mRNA or cDNA molecule.

The current limitations of long-read sequencing technologies in terms of accuracy and throughput need to be addressed. While long-read sequencing offers advantages for isoform expression quantification and rare isoform discovery, there are still challenges to overcome. The accuracy and throughput of long-read sequencing need improvement to provide reliable and comprehensive results. This research aims to address the limitations of long-read sequencing technologies and develop a method for isoform quantification and analysis using long-read direct mRNA sequencing or cDNA sequencing data.

Understanding the isoform-specific gene expression and alternative splicing events is crucial for characterizing and understanding transcriptomic variations, as misregulation of splicing is associated with various human diseases. Therefore, accurate quantification of isoform expression and detection of differential alternative splicing events are essential for advancing our knowledge in this field.

In this study, the authors present LIQA, a method for quantifying isoform expression and detecting differential alternative splicing events using long-read sequencing data. LIQA incorporates base pair quality score and isoform-specific read length information in a survival model and uses an expectation-maximization algorithm for parameter estimation. The authors apply LIQA to long-read RNA-seq data and demonstrate its high accuracy in profiling alternative splicing events.

In conclusion, long-read sequencing technologies offer the potential to overcome the limitations of short-read sequencing in transcriptomics studies. However, there are still challenges in terms of accuracy and throughput. The development of methods such as LIQA can contribute to improving the quantification of isoform expression and the detection of alternative splicing events using long-read sequencing data.

The research in long-read sequencing technologies is crucial due to their potential impact on accurately and efficiently identifying splicing variations at both the isoform and gene levels. This is particularly relevant in the context of analyzing Universal Human Reference RNA-seq data, which encompasses RNA molecules from a diverse set of cancer cell lines. The limitations of current long-read sequencing technologies in terms of accuracy and throughput are evident, especially when considering the challenges in detecting differential alternative splicing (DAS) and evaluating isoform expression quantification. The research aims to address these limitations and improve the accuracy and throughput of long-read sequencing technologies, particularly Nanopore direct mRNA sequencing. The significance of this research lies in its potential to advance transcriptomic studies by providing more accurate and reliable results compared to traditional short-read sequencing methods. Furthermore, the impact of this research extends to facilitating more robust transcriptomic analyses, ultimately contributing to a deeper understanding of gene expression regulation and its implications in various biological processes. The necessity of this research is underscored by the need to enhance the reliability and accuracy of long-read sequencing technologies, thereby enabling more comprehensive and precise insights into gene expression dynamics.
 The source url is :https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8350331/pdf/  The INTRODUCTION section is below: The introduction of the paper discusses the opportunities and challenges associated with long-read sequencing technologies. These technologies, such as Pacific Biosciences' single-molecule real-time (SMRT) sequencing and Oxford Nanopore Technologies' (ONT) nanopore sequencing, have overcome early limitations in accuracy and throughput, making them applicable for a broad range of genomics applications. However, the unique characteristics of long-read data require dedicated analysis tools. To address this need, the authors review the current landscape of available tools and introduce an online interactive database, long-read-tools.org, to facilitate browsing and selection of analysis tools.

The introduction highlights the advantages of long-read sequencing, including improved accuracy, increased throughput, and reduced cost. It also mentions the two dominant technologies, SMRT sequencing and nanopore sequencing, and the differences in their read lengths and basecalling accuracy. The ability of long-read sequencing to span repeated elements and repetitive regions is emphasized as a key advantage for de novo assembly and detection of structural variants (SVs).

The limitations of current long-read sequencing technologies are also discussed, such as the high cost of obtaining deep coverage for mammalian-sized genomes. However, even modest coverage has been shown to be effective in detecting pathogenic variants in humans. The importance of benchmarking and evaluating the performance of long-read SV callers is emphasized.

To assist researchers in the design and analysis of long-read sequencing projects, the authors introduce the long-read-tools.org database, which categorizes tools based on technology and intended type of analysis. The database includes not only true long-read sequencing technologies but also synthetic long-read strategies. The authors encourage researchers to contribute new database entries and indicate when tools become obsolete or are no longer maintained.

Overall, the introduction provides a comprehensive overview of the background, significance, and challenges associated with long-read sequencing technologies. It highlights the need for dedicated analysis tools and introduces the long-read-tools.org database as a valuable resource for researchers in this field.

Yet, in many instances        short-read HTS techniques are suboptimal, for example, by providing insufficient        phylogenetic resolution or low integrity of assembled genomes. Single-molecule        and synthetic long-read (SLR) HTS methods have successfully ameliorated these        limitations. In addition, nanopore sequencing has generated a number of unique        analysis opportunities, such as rapid molecular diagnostics and direct RNA        sequencing, and both Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) and nanopore sequencing support        detection of epigenetic modifications. Although initially suffering from        relatively low sequence quality, recent advances have greatly improved the        accuracy of long-read sequencing technologies. In spite of great technological        progress in recent years, the long-read HTS methods (PacBio and nanopore        sequencing) are still relatively costly, require large amounts of high-quality        starting material, and commonly need specific solutions in various analysis        steps. Despite these challenges, long-read sequencing technologies offer        high-quality, cutting-edge alternatives for testing hypotheses about microbiome        structure and functioning as well as assembly of eukaryote genomes from complex        environmental DNA samples.', 'Long-read DNA sequencing technologies have been rapidly evolving in recent years,        and their ability to assess large and complex regions of the genome makes them        ideal for clinical applications in molecular diagnosis and therapy selection,        thereby providing a valuable tool for precision medicine. In the third-generation        sequencing duopoly, Oxford Nanopore Technologies and Pacific Biosciences work        towards increasing the accuracy, throughput, and portability of long-read        sequencing methods while trying to keep costs low. These trades have made        long-read sequencing an attractive tool for use in research and clinical        settings. This article provides an overview of current clinical applications and        limitations of long-read sequencing and explores its potential for point-of-care        testing and health care in remote settings.', 'Long-read RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) technologies can sequence full-length        transcripts, facilitating the exploration of isoform-specific gene expression        over short-read RNA-seq. We present LIQA to quantify isoform expression and        detect differential alternative splicing (DAS) events using long-read direct mRNA        sequencing or cDNA sequencing data. LIQA incorporates base pair quality score and        isoform-specific read length information in a survival model to assign different        weights across reads, and uses an expectation-maximization algorithm for        parameter estimation. We apply LIQA to long-read RNA-seq data from the Universal        Human Reference, acute myeloid leukemia, and esophageal squamous epithelial cells        and demonstrate its high accuracy in profiling alternative splicing events.', 'In recent years, the so-called long-read sequencing technology has had a        substantial impact on various aspects of genome sciences. Here, we introduce        recent studies of cancerous structural variants (SVs) using long-read sequencing        technologies, namely Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) sequencers, Oxford Nanopore        Technologies (ONT) sequencers, and linked-read methods. By taking advantage of        long-read lengths, these technologies have enabled the precise detection of SVs,        including long insertions by transposable elements, such as LINE-1. In addition        to SV detection, the epigenome status (including DNA methylation and haplotype        information) surrounding SV loci has also been unveiled by long-read sequencing        technologies, to identify the effects of SVs. Among the various research fields        in which long-read sequencing has been applied, cancer genomics has shown the        most remarkable advances. In fact, many studies are beginning to shed light on        the detection of SVs and the elucidation of their complex structures in various        types of cancer. In the particular case of cancers, we summarize the technical        limitations of the application of this technology to the analysis of clinical        samples. We will introduce recent achievements from this viewpoint. However, a        similar approach will be started for other applications in the near future.        Therefore, by complementing the current short-read sequencing analysis, long-read        sequencing should reveal the complex nature of human genomes in their healthy and        disease states, which will open a new opportunity for a better understanding of        disease development and for a novel strategy for drug development.'] The research question is: What are the current limitations of long-read sequencing technologies in terms of accuracy and throughput?

 Literature Review:

Long-read RNA sequencing has gained popularity in recent years due to its potential to overcome the limitations associated with short-read RNA sequencing. Previous studies have utilized both single-molecule long-read PacBio Iso-Seq and synthetic long-read MOLECULO methods. Oxford Nanopore sequencing, specifically the MinION platform, has also been used for analyzing full-length cDNA samples and mRNA samples derived from tissue cells. The advantage of long reads in nanopore sequencing allows for the sequencing of a large portion or the entire mRNA or cDNA molecule, facilitating rare isoform discovery and isoform expression quantification.

Short-read RNA sequencing has been the method of choice for transcriptomics studies, but it has limitations in accurately characterizing transcripts due to its limited read length. Long-read RNA sequencing, on the other hand, offers higher coverage and single-nucleotide resolution, enabling the measurement of isoform-specific gene expression, the discovery of novel transcript isoform signatures, and the detection of differential alternative splicing events.

To address the challenge of accurately characterizing isoforms using long-read RNA sequencing, the article introduces a method called LIQA (Long-Read Isoform Quantification and Analysis). LIQA incorporates a read distribution modeling approach and considers incorrect alignment at splice sites. The method aims to estimate isoform expression based on RNA-seq long reads mapped to the gene. Benchmarking results show that LIQA outperforms other approaches in terms of detecting differential alternative splicing events and accurately estimating isoform expressions.

However, LIQA's computational efficiency is currently being evaluated, and possible trade-offs between computational efficiency and estimation accuracy are being considered. The article also mentions the use of other methods such as FLAIR, Mandalorion, TALON, and the Oxford Nanopore Pipeline for isoform quantification and analysis.

In summary, long-read RNA sequencing technologies, such as PacBio Iso-Seq, synthetic long-read methods, and Oxford Nanopore sequencing, offer advantages over short-read RNA sequencing in characterizing transcripts and identifying isoforms. The LIQA method proposed in the article shows promising results in accurately estimating isoform expressions and detecting differential alternative splicing events. However, further research is needed to optimize LIQA's computational efficiency and explore other methods for isoform quantification and analysis.

 Literature Review:

The literature review section of the provided article focuses on the limitations of long-read sequencing technologies in terms of accuracy and throughput. The authors discuss various experimental methods and tools used to detect base modifications in nanopore data. They mention techniques such as hidden Markov models (HMM), hierarchical Dirichlet process (HPD), and convolutional neural networks (CNN) that have been employed to identify modifications like 5mC and m6A. However, the accuracy of these methods varies between different modifications and motifs, and the availability of appropriate training data is a limiting factor.

The article also highlights the challenges in accurately detecting base modifications at the single-molecule level. While comparing to a control sample improves detection accuracy, it requires sequencing twice as many samples and high coverage. De novo calling of base modifications can only highlight regions that may contain modified bases without revealing the precise base or modification type. Additionally, the article mentions that PCR-based methods for quantifying transcript or gene abundance are not well-characterized in long-read sequencing.

To address the limitations of long-read sequencing data analysis, the authors emphasize the need for dedicated analysis tools that consider the unique characteristics of long reads, such as their error rate. They highlight the importance of benchmarking these tools using publicly available datasets with known ground truth. The authors also introduce an online interactive database called long-read-tools.org to facilitate the browsing of available tools for long-read sequencing analysis.

Yet, in many instances        short-read HTS techniques are suboptimal, for example, by providing insufficient        phylogenetic resolution or low integrity of assembled genomes. Single-molecule        and synthetic long-read (SLR) HTS methods have successfully ameliorated these        limitations. In addition, nanopore sequencing has generated a number of unique        analysis opportunities, such as rapid molecular diagnostics and direct RNA        sequencing, and both Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) and nanopore sequencing support        detection of epigenetic modifications. Although initially suffering from        relatively low sequence quality, recent advances have greatly improved the        accuracy of long-read sequencing technologies. In spite of great technological        progress in recent years, the long-read HTS methods (PacBio and nanopore        sequencing) are still relatively costly, require large amounts of high-quality        starting material, and commonly need specific solutions in various analysis        steps.

By taking advantage of        long-read lengths, these technologies have enabled the precise detection of SVs,        including long insertions by transposable elements, such as LINE-1. In addition        to SV detection, the epigenome status (including DNA methylation and haplotype        information) surrounding SV loci has also been unveiled by long-read sequencing        technologies, to identify the effects of SVs.

Based on the provided abstracts and discussions, it is apparent that long-read sequencing technologies offer several advantages but also face limitations in terms of accuracy and throughput. Here is a synthesized discussion section for a paper addressing the current limitations of long-read sequencing technologies:

Discussion:
Long-read sequencing technologies, such as PacBio and nanopore sequencing, have significantly advanced genomics applications by providing improved phylogenetic resolution, assembly of complex genomes, and potential clinical applications. However, these technologies are not without limitations. One of the foremost challenges is the relatively high error rates associated with long reads compared to short-read technologies. While recent advances have improved the accuracy of long-read sequencing, continued efforts are required to enhance error correction algorithms and refine base calling methods to mitigate this limitation.

Another significant limitation is the relatively high cost and the substantial amounts of high-quality starting material required for long-read sequencing. Additionally, these technologies typically have lower throughput compared to short-read methods, which hinders their practicality for large-scale studies. Despite the substantial technological progress, the cost-effectiveness and scalability of long-read sequencing technologies remain as areas requiring further improvement.

Moreover, long-read transcriptomics analysis introduces unique challenges, including coverage bias, sequence biases, and reproducibility. These challenges need to be addressed to ensure the comprehensive and accurate analysis of transcriptomes using long-read sequencing technologies. Furthermore, there are limitations in the replication and read counts of long-read transcriptomic experiments, which currently restrict their effective utilization for transcript-level differential expression analysis.

To address these limitations, future research directions should focus on developing more advanced algorithms for error correction and base calling, as well as enhancing the throughput of long-read sequencing technologies. Furthermore, increasing the accessibility of long-read sequencing by reducing costs and optimizing protocols for smaller sample inputs could expand the practical utility of these technologies.

In conclusion, while long-read sequencing technologies offer cutting-edge alternatives for various genomics and transcriptomics applications, their limitations in accuracy, cost, and throughput necessitate further research and development. Efforts to overcome these limitations are crucial for maximizing the potential of long-read sequencing technologies and expanding their applications in both research and clinical settings.

We further focus on the principles of error correction, base modification detection, and long-read transcriptomics analysis and highlight the challenges that remain.Related paper titles: ['Perspectives and Benefits of High-Throughput Long-Read Sequencing in Microbial        Ecology.', 'The application of long-read sequencing in clinical settings.', 'LIQA: long-read isoform quantification and analysis.', 'Application of long-read sequencing to the detection of structural variants in        human cancer genomes.']Related paper abstracts: ['Short-read, high-throughput sequencing (HTS) methods have yielded numerous        important insights into microbial ecology and function. Yet, in many instances        short-read HTS techniques are suboptimal, for example, by providing insufficient        phylogenetic resolution or low integrity of assembled genomes. Single-molecule        and synthetic long-read (SLR) HTS methods have successfully ameliorated these        limitations. In addition, nanopore sequencing has generated a number of unique        analysis opportunities, such as rapid molecular diagnostics and direct RNA        sequencing, and both Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) and nanopore sequencing support        detection of epigenetic modifications. Although initially suffering from        relatively low sequence quality, recent advances have greatly improved the        accuracy of long-read sequencing technologies. In spite of great technological        progress in recent years, the long-read HTS methods (PacBio and nanopore        sequencing) are still relatively costly, require large amounts of high-quality        starting material, and commonly need specific solutions in various analysis        steps. Despite these challenges, long-read sequencing technologies offer        high-quality, cutting-edge alternatives for testing hypotheses about microbiome        structure and functioning as well as assembly of eukaryote genomes from complex        environmental DNA samples.', 'Long-read DNA sequencing technologies have been rapidly evolving in recent years,        and their ability to assess large and complex regions of the genome makes them        ideal for clinical applications in molecular diagnosis and therapy selection,        thereby providing a valuable tool for precision medicine. In the third-generation        sequencing duopoly, Oxford Nanopore Technologies and Pacific Biosciences work        towards increasing the accuracy, throughput, and portability of long-read        sequencing methods while trying to keep costs low. These trades have made        long-read sequencing an attractive tool for use in research and clinical        settings. This article provides an overview of current clinical applications and        limitations of long-read sequencing and explores its potential for point-of-care        testing and health care in remote settings.', 'Long-read RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) technologies can sequence full-length        transcripts, facilitating the exploration of isoform-specific gene expression        over short-read RNA-seq. We present LIQA to quantify isoform expression and        detect differential alternative splicing (DAS) events using long-read direct mRNA        sequencing or cDNA sequencing data. LIQA incorporates base pair quality score and        isoform-specific read length information in a survival model to assign different        weights across reads, and uses an expectation-maximization algorithm for        parameter estimation. We apply LIQA to long-read RNA-seq data from the Universal        Human Reference, acute myeloid leukemia, and esophageal squamous epithelial cells        and demonstrate its high accuracy in profiling alternative splicing events.', 'In recent years, the so-called long-read sequencing technology has had a        substantial impact on various aspects of genome sciences. Here, we introduce        recent studies of cancerous structural variants (SVs) using long-read sequencing        technologies, namely Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) sequencers, Oxford Nanopore        Technologies (ONT) sequencers, and linked-read methods. By taking advantage of        long-read lengths, these technologies have enabled the precise detection of SVs,        including long insertions by transposable elements, such as LINE-1. In addition        to SV detection, the epigenome status (including DNA methylation and haplotype        information) surrounding SV loci has also been unveiled by long-read sequencing        technologies, to identify the effects of SVs. Among the various research fields        in which long-read sequencing has been applied, cancer genomics has shown the        most remarkable advances. In fact, many studies are beginning to shed light on        the detection of SVs and the elucidation of their complex structures in various        types of cancer. In the particular case of cancers, we summarize the technical        limitations of the application of this technology to the analysis of clinical        samples. We will introduce recent achievements from this viewpoint. However, a        similar approach will be started for other applications in the near future.        Therefore, by complementing the current short-read sequencing analysis, long-read        sequencing should reveal the complex nature of human genomes in their healthy and        disease states, which will open a new opportunity for a better understanding of        disease development and for a novel strategy for drug development.']With the provided research problem, scientific method, existing studies, your objective now is to design an experiment that not only leverages these resources but also strives to be clear, robust, reproducible, valid, and feasible.

The controlled nature of the comparison will provide robust and reproducible insights into the impact of machine learning on precise SV detection, optimization, and its implication in cancer genomics research and precision medicine.', 'More related paper': "Paper 1\nTitle: Perspectives and Benefits of High-Throughput Long-Read Sequencing in Microbial        Ecology.\n\nAbstract: Short-read, high-throughput sequencing (HTS) methods have yielded numerous        important insights into microbial ecology and function. Yet, in many instances        short-read HTS techniques are suboptimal, for example, by providing insufficient        phylogenetic resolution or low integrity of assembled genomes. Single-molecule        and synthetic long-read (SLR) HTS methods have successfully ameliorated these        limitations. In addition, nanopore sequencing has generated a number of unique        analysis opportunities, such as rapid molecular diagnostics and direct RNA        sequencing, and both Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) and nanopore sequencing support        detection of epigenetic modifications. Although initially suffering from        relatively low sequence quality, recent advances have greatly improved the        accuracy of long-read sequencing technologies. In spite of great technological        progress in recent years, the long-read HTS methods (PacBio and nanopore        sequencing) are still relatively costly, require large amounts of high-quality        starting material, and commonly need specific solutions in various analysis        steps. Despite these challenges, long-read sequencing technologies offer        high-quality, cutting-edge alternatives for testing hypotheses about microbiome        structure and functioning as well as assembly of eukaryote genomes from complex        environmental DNA samples.\n\nDOI: 10.1128/AEM.00626-21\nThe impact factor: 5.005\n\n\n\nPaper 2\nTitle: The application of long-read sequencing in clinical settings.\n\nAbstract: Long-read DNA sequencing technologies have been rapidly evolving in recent years,        and their ability to assess large and complex regions of the genome makes them        ideal for clinical applications in molecular diagnosis and therapy selection,        thereby providing a valuable tool for precision medicine. In the third-generation        sequencing duopoly, Oxford Nanopore Technologies and Pacific Biosciences work        towards increasing the accuracy, throughput, and portability of long-read        sequencing methods while trying to keep costs low. These trades have made        long-read sequencing an attractive tool for use in research and clinical        settings. This article provides an overview of current clinical applications and        limitations of long-read sequencing and explores its potential for point-of-care        testing and health care in remote settings.\n\nDOI: 10.1186/s40246-023-00522-3\nThe impact factor: 6.481\n\n\n\nPaper 3\nTitle: LIQA: long-read isoform quantification and analysis.\n\nAbstract: Long-read RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) technologies can sequence full-length        transcripts, facilitating the exploration of isoform-specific gene expression        over short-read RNA-seq. We present LIQA to quantify isoform expression and        detect differential alternative splicing (DAS) events using long-read direct mRNA        sequencing or cDNA sequencing data. LIQA incorporates base pair quality score and        isoform-specific read length information in a survival model to assign different        weights across reads, and uses an expectation-maximization algorithm for        parameter estimation. We apply LIQA to long-read RNA-seq data from the Universal        Human Reference, acute myeloid leukemia, and esophageal squamous epithelial cells        and demonstrate its high accuracy in profiling alternative splicing events.\n\nDOI: 10.1186/s13059-021-02399-8\nThe impact factor: 17.906\n\n\n\nPaper 4\nTitle: Application of long-read sequencing to the detection of structural variants in        human cancer genomes.\n\nAbstract: In recent years, the so-called long-read sequencing technology has had a        substantial impact on various aspects of genome sciences. Here, we introduce        recent studies of cancerous structural variants (SVs) using long-read sequencing        technologies, namely Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) sequencers, Oxford Nanopore        Technologies (ONT) sequencers, and linked-read methods. By taking advantage of        long-read lengths, these technologies have enabled the precise detection of SVs,        including long insertions by transposable elements, such as LINE-1. In addition        to SV detection, the epigenome status (including DNA methylation and haplotype        information) surrounding SV loci has also been unveiled by long-read sequencing        technologies, to identify the effects of SVs. Among the various research fields        in which long-read sequencing has been applied, cancer genomics has shown the        most remarkable advances. In fact, many studies are beginning to shed light on        the detection of SVs and the elucidation of their complex structures in various        types of cancer. In the particular case of cancers, we summarize the technical        limitations of the application of this technology to the analysis of clinical        samples. We will introduce recent achievements from this viewpoint. However, a        similar approach will be started for other applications in the near future.        Therefore, by complementing the current short-read sequencing analysis, long-read        sequencing should reveal the complex nature of human genomes in their healthy and        disease states, which will open a new opportunity for a better understanding of        disease development and for a novel strategy for drug development.\n\nDOI: 10.1016/j.csbj.2021.07.030\nThe impact factor: 6.155\n\n\n\nPaper 5\nTitle: Benchmarking long-read RNA-sequencing analysis tools using in silico mixtures.\n\nAbstract: The lack of benchmark data sets with inbuilt ground-truth makes it challenging to        compare the performance of existing long-read isoform detection and differential        expression analysis workflows. Here, we present a benchmark experiment using two        human lung adenocarcinoma cell lines that were each profiled in triplicate        together with synthetic, spliced, spike-in RNAs (sequins). Samples were deeply        sequenced on both Illumina short-read and Oxford Nanopore Technologies long-read        platforms. Alongside the ground-truth available via the sequins, we created in        silico mixture samples to allow performance assessment in the absence of true        positives or true negatives. Our results show that StringTie2 and bambu        outperformed other tools from the six isoform detection tools tested, DESeq2,        edgeR and limma-voom were best among the five differential transcript expression        tools tested and there was no clear front-runner for performing differential        transcript usage analysis between the five tools compared, which suggests further        methods development is needed for this application.\n\nDOI: 10.1038/s41592-023-02026-3\nThe impact factor: 47.99\n\n\n\nPaper 6\nTitle: PBSIM2: a simulator for long-read sequencers with a novel generative model of        quality scores.\n\nAbstract: MOTIVATION: Recent advances in high-throughput long-read sequencers, such as        PacBio and Oxford Nanopore sequencers, produce longer reads with more errors than        short-read sequencers. In addition to the high error rates of reads,        non-uniformity of errors leads to difficulties in various downstream analyses        using long reads. Many useful simulators, which characterize long-read error        patterns and simulate them, have been developed. However, there is still room for        improvement in the simulation of the non-uniformity of errors. RESULTS: To        capture characteristics of errors in reads for long-read sequencers, here, we        introduce a generative model for quality scores, in which a hidden Markov Model        with a latest model selection method, called factorized information criteria, is        utilized. We evaluated our developed simulator from various points, indicating        that our simulator successfully simulates reads that are consistent with real        reads.

We present ESPRESSO, a computational tool for robust discovery and        quantification of transcript isoforms from error-prone long reads. ESPRESSO        jointly considers alignments of all long reads aligned to a gene and uses error        profiles of individual reads to improve the identification of splice junctions        and the discovery of their corresponding transcript isoforms. On both a synthetic        spike-in RNA sample and human RNA samples, ESPRESSO outperforms multiple        contemporary tools in not only transcript isoform discovery but also transcript        isoform quantification. In total, we generated and analyzed ~1.1 billion nanopore        RNA-seq reads covering 30 human tissue samples and three human cell lines.        ESPRESSO and its companion dataset provide a useful resource for studying the RNA        repertoire of eukaryotic transcriptomes.\n\nDOI: 10.1126/sciadv.abq5072\nThe impact factor: 14.957\n\n\n\nPaper 8\nTitle: Illuminating the dark side of the human transcriptome with long read transcript        sequencing.\n\nAbstract: BACKGROUND: The human transcriptome annotation is regarded as one of the most        complete of any eukaryotic species. However, limitations in sequencing        technologies have biased the annotation toward multi-exonic protein coding genes.        Accurate high-throughput long read transcript sequencing can now provide        additional evidence for rare transcripts and genes such as mono-exonic and        non-coding genes that were previously either undetectable or impossible to        differentiate from sequencing noise. RESULTS: We developed the Transcriptome        Annotation by Modular Algorithms (TAMA) software to leverage the power of long        read transcript sequencing and address the issues with current data processing        pipelines. TAMA achieved high sensitivity and precision for gene and transcript        model predictions in both reference guided and unguided approaches in our        benchmark tests using simulated Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) and Nanopore        sequencing data and real PacBio datasets. By analyzing PacBio Sequel II Iso-Seq        sequencing data of the Universal Human Reference RNA (UHRR) using TAMA and other        commonly used tools, we found that the convention of using alignment identity to        measure error correction performance does not reflect actual gain in accuracy of        predicted transcript models. In addition, inter-read error correction can cause        major changes to read mapping, resulting in potentially over 6â\x80\x89K erroneous gene        model predictions in the Iso-Seq based human genome annotation. Using TAMA's        genome assembly based error correction and gene feature evidence, we predicted        2566 putative novel non-coding genes and 1557 putative novel protein coding gene        models. CONCLUSIONS: Long read transcript sequencing data has the power to        identify novel genes within the highly annotated human genome. The use of        parameter tuning and extensive output information of the TAMA software package        allows for in depth exploration of eukaryotic transcriptomes. We have found long        read data based evidence for thousands of unannotated genes within the human        genome. More development in sequencing library preparation and data processing        are required for differentiating sequencing noise from real genes in long read        RNA sequencing data.\n\nDOI: 10.1186/s12864-020-07123-7\nThe impact factor: 4.547\n\n\n\nPaper 9\nTitle: Nanopore sequencing technology, bioinformatics and applications.\n\nAbstract: Rapid advances in nanopore technologies for sequencing single long DNA and RNA        molecules have led to substantial improvements in accuracy, read length and        throughput. These breakthroughs have required extensive development of        experimental and bioinformatics methods to fully exploit nanopore long reads for        investigations of genomes, transcriptomes, epigenomes and epitranscriptomes.        Nanopore sequencing is being applied in genome assembly, full-length transcript        detection and base modification detection and in more specialized areas, such as        rapid clinical diagnoses and outbreak surveillance. Many opportunities remain for        improving data quality and analytical approaches through the development of new        nanopores, base-calling methods and experimental protocols tailored to particular        applications.\n\nDOI: 10.1038/s41587-021-01108-x\nThe impact factor: 68.164\n\n\n\nPaper 10\nTitle: Third-Generation Sequencing: The Spearhead towards the Radical Transformation of        Modern Genomics.\n\nAbstract: Although next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology revolutionized sequencing,        offering a tremendous sequencing capacity with groundbreaking depth and accuracy,        it continues to demonstrate serious limitations. In the early 2010s, the        introduction of a novel set of sequencing methodologies, presented by two        platforms, Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) and Oxford Nanopore Sequencing (ONT),        gave birth to third-generation sequencing (TGS). The innovative long-read        technologies turn genome sequencing into an ease-of-handle procedure by greatly        reducing the average time of library construction workflows and simplifying the        process of de novo genome assembly due to the generation of long reads. Long        sequencing reads produced by both TGS methodologies have already facilitated the        decipherment of transcriptional profiling since they enable the identification of        full-length transcripts without the need for assembly or the use of sophisticated        bioinformatics tools. Long-read technologies have also provided new insights into        the field of epitranscriptomics, by allowing the direct detection of RNA        modifications on native RNA molecules. This review highlights the advantageous        features of the newly introduced TGS technologies, discusses their limitations        and provides an in-depth comparison regarding their scientific background and        available protocols as well as their potential utility in research and clinical        applications.\n\nDOI: 10.3390/life12010030\nThe impact factor: 3.251\n\n\n\n"}

Neuroinflammation, characterized by the release of neurotoxic mediators, has been identified as a significant factor in the progression of neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Parkinson's disease (PD), and multiple sclerosis (MS). The histopathological features of these disorders include aberrant protein conformation, impaired cell differentiation, and neuroanatomical distribution, which are influenced by epigenetic modifications. Epigenetic mechanisms such as microRNAs and histone modifications have been implicated in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases, with evidence suggesting their involvement in the regulation of amyloid beta (Aβ) plaques and hyperphosphorylated tau (p-tau) proteins in AD. Additionally, epigenetic changes affecting mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) have been linked to astrocyte dysfunction in ALS. These findings underscore the importance of understanding the role of epigenetics in the development and progression of neurodegenerative diseases, providing potential targets for therapeutic interventions. This research aims to elucidate the influence of epigenetic modifications on the pathophysiology of neurodegenerative diseases, with implications for the development of novel treatment strategies.

Neuroinflammation, characterized by an inflammatory state affecting the central nervous system (CNS) and mediated by various neurotoxic mediators, has been identified as a crucial factor in the progression of neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Parkinson's disease (PD), and multiple sclerosis (MS). The hallmark histopathological feature of these disorders involves aberrant protein conformation leading to impaired cellular communication, differentiation, and neuroanatomical distribution. Moreover, epigenetic modifications, particularly in the context of Alzheimer's disease, have been implicated in the regulation of amyloid-beta (Aβ) plaques and phosphorylated tau (p-tau) formation, suggesting a potential link between epigenetics and the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases. Furthermore, research has indicated a relationship between ATP release upon neuronal death, activation of microglia, and the subsequent inflammatory response, emphasizing the involvement of purinergic receptors and neuroinflammation in the pathophysiology of ALS. Additionally, dysfunctions in astrocytes, including impaired glutamate clearance and metabolic dysregulation, have been associated with ALS, further highlighting the complexity of neuroinflammatory-driven diseases. The role of epigenetics in modulating neuroinflammation and its potential impact on the development and progression of neurodegenerative diseases remains a critical area of research, with implications for understanding disease mechanisms and identifying potential therapeutic targets.

Neuroinflammation has been identified as a pivotal factor in the progression of neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Parkinson's disease (PD), and multiple sclerosis (MS). These disorders are characterized by aberrant protein conformation leading to impaired cell differentiation, abnormal intercellular communication, and neuroanatomical distribution. The release of neurotoxic mediators, including interleukin-1beta (IL-1β), IL-6, IL-8, tumor necrosis factor (TNF), and other molecules by astrocytes and microglia, contributes to chronic neuroinflammation, which is detrimental and serves as a critical point for the onset of neurodegenerative disorders. The role of epigenetic modifications in these diseases is gaining attention, particularly in the context of chromatin remodeling, histone acetylation, and DNA methylation.

Recent research has highlighted the association between epigenetic modifications and the pathological features of neurodegenerative disorders. Epigenetic mechanisms such as microRNAs (miRNAs) and chromatin remodeling have been linked to the regulation of amyloid-beta (Aβ) plaques and tau protein (p-tau) accumulation in AD. Additionally, epigenetic changes affecting mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) have been associated with astrocyte metabolic dysfunctions in ALS. These findings underscore the significance of understanding the impact of epigenetic modifications on the development and progression of neurodegenerative diseases.

The complex interplay between neuroinflammation, epigenetic modifications, and the pathological traits of neurodegenerative disorders necessitates further investigation. Understanding the influence of epigenetic mechanisms on the molecular pathways involved in these diseases is crucial for developing targeted therapeutic interventions. Therefore, this research aims to elucidate the role of epigenetic modifications in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases, with a specific focus on unraveling the mechanisms underlying disease progression and identifying potential therapeutic targets.

The study of epigenetic modifications and their influence on the development and progression of neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's, is of significant importance. Epigenetic mechanisms, including DNA methylation, histone post-translational modifications, and changes in nucleosome positioning, play a crucial role in regulating gene expression, cellular differentiation, and development in the brain. Dysregulation of these mechanisms has been implicated in various neurodegenerative disorders, leading to impaired cognition and neuronal death. Specifically, the restrictive element 1-silencing transcription factor (REST) has been identified as a key player in orchestrating epigenetic remodeling of genes essential for synaptic plasticity and survival, thus impacting memory acquisition and consolidation in the healthy brain. This dysregulation of REST and REST-dependent epigenetic remodeling has been associated with impaired cognition and neuronal death in diseases such as Alzheimer's, Huntington's, stroke, and global ischemia. Furthermore, studies have demonstrated specific epigenetic modifications, such as increased DNA methylation, in post-mortem tissues from patients with Alzheimer's disease, suggesting a potential link between epigenetic alterations and disease progression. The emerging understanding of the role of epigenetics in learning, memory, and neurodegenerative disorders underscores the necessity of further research in this field to elucidate the causal relationship between epigenetic dysregulation and impaired cognition, as well as to identify potential therapeutic targets. The potential impact of this research lies in informing the design of novel therapeutic strategies for ameliorating the cognitive deficits and neurodegeneration associated with neurodegenerative diseases.

Recent discoveries have        shed light on critical functions of chromatin in the aging brain, with an        emerging realization that the maintenance of a healthy brain relies heavily on        epigenetic mechanisms. Here, we present recent advances, with a focus on histone        modifications and the implications for several neurodegenerative diseases        including Alzheimer's disease (AD), Huntington's disease (HD), and amyotrophic        lateral sclerosis (ALS). We highlight common and unique epigenetic mechanisms        among these situations and point to emerging therapeutic approaches.", 'Epigenetic mechanisms - including DNA methylation, histone post-translational        modifications and changes in nucleosome positioning - regulate gene expression,        cellular differentiation and development in almost all tissues, including the        brain.

 ### Literature Review:

Neurodegenerative diseases are characterized by the progressive loss of neurons in the central and/or peripheral nervous systems. Neuroinflammation plays a significant role in the progression of neurodegeneration, particularly in diseases like Alzheimer's, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Parkinson's, and multiple sclerosis (MS). The inflammatory state affecting the central nervous system (CNS) is triggered by various insults such as infections, trauma, ischemia, and toxins, leading to the release of neurotoxic mediators like interleukin-1beta (IL-1β), tumor necrosis factor (TNF), and chemokines by astrocytes and microglia.

The hallmark feature of neurodegenerative disorders is the aberrant protein conformation that disrupts intercellular communication, cell differentiation, and neuroanatomical distribution. Epigenetic changes, which encompass modifications affecting gene expression without altering the DNA sequence, have gained attention in understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying neurodegeneration. These changes are influenced by factors like age, diet, stress, and disease state.

Recent studies have focused on the epigenetic profile of neurodegenerative diseases to enhance diagnostic strategies beyond neuropathological evaluations at autopsy. Diagnostic biomarkers are currently limited to neurodegenerative diseases associated with specific genetic mutations. Pharmacological treatments for these diseases have shown limited effectiveness, emphasizing the need for a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved.

Epigenetic modifications, including alterations in chromatin architecture mediated by chemical modifications of DNA nucleobases and histones, have been implicated in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases. For instance, miRNAs have been linked to the regulation of key proteins like BACE1 and CAMKK2 involved in the formation of amyloid plaques and tau phosphorylation in Alzheimer's disease. Additionally, dysregulation of histone acetylation has been observed in post-mortem Alzheimer's brains, suggesting a potential epigenetic mechanism contributing to the disease.

In conclusion, exploring the role of epigenetics in neuroinflammatory-driven diseases provides valuable insights into the pathophysiology of neurodegenerative disorders like Alzheimer's. Understanding the epigenetic modifications influencing disease development and progression could pave the way for novel diagnostic and therapeutic approaches in the future.

Literature Review:

Neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Parkinson's, and multiple sclerosis (MS) pose significant clinical challenges due to their progressive nature and limited therapeutic options. The role of epigenetic modifications in influencing the development and progression of these diseases is a subject of intensive research. This literature review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the existing knowledge on the influence of epigenetic mechanisms, particularly in the context of neuroinflammatory-driven diseases.

Neuroinflammation has emerged as a critical factor in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer's disease. The release of neurotoxic mediators, such as interleukin-1beta (IL-1β), tumor necrosis factor (TNF), and chemokines, by astrocytes and microglia in response to various insults triggers a cascade of detrimental effects contributing to disease progression (Source 1). Moreover, the aberrant protein conformation disrupts intercellular communication, cell differentiation, and neuroanatomical distribution, further exacerbating the pathological processes in these disorders (Source 2). 

Recent research has shed light on the significance of epigenetic modifications, including DNA methylation, histone post-translational modifications, and changes in nucleosome positioning, in regulating gene expression, cellular differentiation, and development in neurodegenerative diseases (Source 3). The dynamic nature of epigenetic mechanisms, particularly their reversibility, highlights their potential as therapeutic targets for intervention in these complex diseases (Source 3).

Furthermore, epigenetic changes are influenced by various factors such as age, diet, stress, and disease state, suggesting a multifaceted regulatory network in neurodegenerative disorders (Source 4). Notably, microRNAs (miRNAs) have been implicated in regulating key proteins associated with the pathology of Alzheimer's, linking them to chromatin remodeling and contributing to disease progression (Source 5).

The review also emphasizes the potential implications of epigenetic modifications for diagnostic strategies and therapeutic approaches in neurodegenerative disorders. Current diagnostic biomarkers are limited, and existing pharmacological treatments show suboptimal effectiveness, necessitating a deeper understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved to facilitate the development of effective interventions (Source 2).

In conclusion, the literature reviewed underscores the pivotal role of epigenetic modifications in influencing the pathophysiology of neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's. Understanding the intricate interplay between epigenetic mechanisms and neuroinflammation is crucial for unraveling the complexities of disease development and progression, paving the way for novel diagnostic and therapeutic approaches in the future.

The article also discusses the findings of studies involving individuals with late-onset Alzheimer's disease and healthy controls, which demonstrated increased DNA methylation in post-mortem tissues from Alzheimer's patients. The study suggests the involvement of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the methylation of specific CpG sites, implicating novel genetic risk factors for late-onset Alzheimer's disease. However, the study also acknowledges important limitations, such as the relevance of certain genes shown to be hypermethylated in Alzheimer's disease remaining unknown.

In comparison with other studies in related fields, the article contributes to the existing literature by highlighting the role of epigenetic dysregulation in neurodegenerative diseases and the potential for new therapeutic approaches targeting epigenetic mechanisms.

Considering the limitations of the current study, potential future research directions could involve further elucidating the specific genes and pathways affected by epigenetic modifications in neurodegenerative diseases, addressing the remaining unknowns from the current study, and exploring the reversibility of epigenetic modifications as a potential avenue for therapeutic interventions.

In summary, this article makes a significant contribution to the understanding of epigenetic mechanisms in neurodegeneration and neuroprotection, providing valuable insights into the potential role of epigenetic modifications in the development and progression of neurodegenerative diseases, particularly Alzheimer's disease. The findings emphasize the importance of further research in this area and the potential for novel therapeutic strategies targeting epigenetic mechanisms.

In the        brain, many of these epigenetic modifications have been widely implicated in        synaptic plasticity and memory formation. Dysregulation of epigenetic mechanisms        has been reported in the aged brain and is associated with or contributes to        memory decline across the lifespan. Furthermore, alterations in the epigenome        have been reported in neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer's disease.        Here, we review the diverse types of epigenetic modifications and their role in        activity- and learning-dependent synaptic plasticity. We then discuss how these        mechanisms become dysregulated across the lifespan and contribute to memory loss        with age and in Alzheimer's disease.

Interestingly, neuroinflammatory        diseases are characterized by dramatic changes in the epigenetic profile, which        might provide novel prognostic and therapeutic factors towards neuroinflammatory        treatment. Deep changes in DNA and histone methylation, along with histone        acetylation and altered non-coding RNA expression, have been reported at the        onset of inflammatory diseases. The aim of this work is to review the current        knowledge on this field.\n\nDOI: 10.3390/ijms232315218\nThe impact factor: 6.208\n\n\n\nPaper 5\nTitle: Epigenetic Changes in Prion and Prion-like Neurodegenerative Diseases: Recent        Advances, Potential as Biomarkers, and Future Perspectives.\n\nAbstract: Prion diseases are transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs) caused by a        conformational conversion of the native cellular prion protein (PrP(C)) to an        abnormal, infectious isoform called PrP(Sc). Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis,        Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and Huntington's diseases are also known as prion-like        diseases because they share common features with prion diseases, including        protein misfolding and aggregation, as well as the spread of these misfolded        proteins into different brain regions. Increasing evidence proposes the        involvement of epigenetic mechanisms, namely DNA methylation, post-translational        modifications of histones, and microRNA-mediated post-transcriptional gene        regulation in the pathogenesis of prion-like diseases. Little is known about the        role of epigenetic modifications in prion diseases, but recent findings also        point to a potential regulatory role of epigenetic mechanisms in the pathology of        these diseases. This review highlights recent findings on epigenetic        modifications in TSEs and prion-like diseases and discusses the potential role of        such mechanisms in disease pathology and their use as potential biomarkers.\n\nDOI: 10.3390/ijms232012609\nThe impact factor: 6.208\n\n\n\nPaper 6\nTitle: The Essential Role of Epigenetic Modifications in Neurodegenerative Diseases with        Dyskinesia.\n\nAbstract: Epigenetics play an essential role in the occurrence and improvement of many        diseases. Evidence shows that epigenetic modifications are crucial to the        regulation of gene expression. DNA methylation is closely linked to embryonic        development in mammalian. In recent years, epigenetic drugs have shown unexpected        therapeutic effects on neurological diseases, leading to the study of the        epigenetic mechanism in neurodegenerative diseases. Unlike genetics, epigenetics        modify the genome without changing the DNA sequence. Research shows that        epigenetics is involved in all aspects of neurodegenerative diseases. The study        of epigenetic will provide valuable insights into the molecular mechanism of        neurodegenerative diseases, which may lead to new treatments and diagnoses. This        article reviews the role of epigenetic modifications neurodegenerative diseases        with dyskinesia, and discusses the therapeutic potential of epigenetic drugs in        neurodegenerative diseases.\n\nDOI: 10.1007/s10571-021-01133-z\nThe impact factor: 4.231\n\n\n\nPaper 7\nTitle: Neuroepigenetic mechanisms in disease.\n\nAbstract: Epigenetics allows for the inheritance of information in cellular lineages during        differentiation, independent of changes to the underlying genetic sequence. This        raises the question of whether epigenetic mechanisms also function in        post-mitotic neurons. During the long life of the neuron, fluctuations in gene        expression allow the cell to pass through stages of differentiation, modulate        synaptic activity in response to environmental cues, and fortify the cell through        age-related neuroprotective pathways. Emerging evidence suggests that epigenetic        mechanisms such as DNA methylation and histone modification permit these dynamic        changes in gene expression throughout the life of a neuron. Accordingly, recent        studies have revealed the vital importance of epigenetic players in the central        nervous system and during neurodegeneration. Here, we provide a review of several        of these recent findings, highlighting novel functions for epigenetics in the        fields of Rett syndrome, Fragile X syndrome, and Alzheimer's disease research.        Together, these discoveries underscore the vital importance of epigenetics in        human neurological disorders.\n\nDOI: 10.1186/s13072-017-0150-4\nThe impact factor: 5.465\n\n\n\nPaper 8\nTitle: Histone Modifications in Alzheimer's Disease.\n\nAbstract: Since Late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD) derives from a combination of genetic        variants and environmental factors, epigenetic modifications have been predicted        to play a role in the etiopathology of LOAD. Along with DNA methylation, histone        modifications have been proposed as the main epigenetic modifications that        contribute to the pathologic mechanisms of LOAD; however, little is known about        how these mechanisms contribute to the disease's onset or progression. In this        review, we highlighted the main histone modifications and their functional role,        including histone acetylation, histone methylation, and histone phosphorylation,        as well as changes in such histone modifications that occur in the aging process        and mainly in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Furthermore, we pointed out the main        epigenetic drugs tested for AD treatment, such as those based on histone        deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors. Finally, we remarked on the perspectives around        the use of such epigenetics drugs for treating AD.\n\nDOI: 10.3390/genes14020347\nThe impact factor: 4.141\n\n\n\nPaper 9\nTitle: Biological aging processes underlying cognitive decline and neurodegenerative        disease.\n\nAbstract: Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) are among the top contributors        to disability and mortality in later life. As with many chronic conditions, aging        is the single most influential factor in the development of ADRD. Even among        older adults who remain free of dementia throughout their lives, cognitive        decline and neurodegenerative changes are appreciable with advancing age,        suggesting shared pathophysiological mechanisms. In this Review, we provide an        overview of changes in cognition, brain morphology, and neuropathological protein        accumulation across the lifespan in humans, with complementary and mechanistic        evidence from animal models. Next, we highlight selected aging processes that are        differentially regulated in neurodegenerative disease, including aberrant        autophagy, mitochondrial dysfunction, cellular senescence, epigenetic changes,        cerebrovascular dysfunction, inflammation, and lipid dysregulation. We summarize        research across clinical and translational studies to link biological aging        processes to underlying ADRD pathogenesis. Targeting fundamental processes        underlying biological aging may represent a yet relatively unexplored avenue to        attenuate both age-related cognitive decline and ADRD. Collaboration across the        fields of geroscience and neuroscience, coupled with the development of new        translational animal models that more closely align with human disease processes,        is necessary to advance novel therapeutic discovery in this realm.\n\nDOI: 10.1172/JCI158453\nThe impact factor: 19.456\n\n\n\nPaper 10\nTitle: The m(6)A epitranscriptome: transcriptome plasticity in brain development and        function.\n\nAbstract: The field of epitranscriptomics examines the recently deciphered form of gene        expression regulation that is mediated by type- and site-specific RNA        modifications. Similarly to the role played by epigenetic mechanisms - which        operate via DNA and histone modifications - epitranscriptomic modifications are        involved in the control of the delicate gene expression patterns that are needed        for the development and activity of the nervous system and are essential for        basic and higher brain functions. Here we describe the mechanisms that are        involved in the writing, erasing and reading of N(6)-methyladenosine, the most        prevalent internal mRNA modification, and the emerging roles played by        N(6)-methyladenosine in the nervous system.\n\nDOI: 10.1038/s41583-019-0244-z\nThe impact factor: 38.755\n\n\n\n"}/home/wangyz/anaconda3/envs/tavily/lib/python3.12/site-packages/langchain/document_loaders/__init__.py:36: LangChainDeprecationWarning: Importing document loaders from langchain is deprecated.

Glioblastoma Multiforme (GBM) is a highly malignant and incurable primary brain tumor characterized by its diffuse and heterogeneous nature. Despite the identification of primitive tumor/glial "stem-like" cells (GSCs) over a decade ago, effective GSC-targeted therapies are yet to be developed. The elucidation of GSC biology and hierarchy is crucial for the development of more effective treatments. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-Seq) has facilitated the characterization of intratumoral heterogeneity in human gliomas and the mapping of developmental lineages across multiple glioma subtypes. Recent research has identified plasticity between different cellular states in IDH-wildtype GBMs, emphasizing the importance of understanding the intratumoral heterogeneity in GBM.

The relevance of the human microenvironment on tumor cell biology, as seen in the GLICO model, is crucial for informing the development of novel ex vivo human cancer models. The study aims to decipher the heterogeneity and dynamics of the tumor microenvironment in GBM using scRNA-Seq. The research is significant due to the genetic/epigenetic heterogeneity and plasticity across cellular states in GBM, which makes it challenging to treat. The ability of current tumor models to recapitulate the cellular states found in primary tumors remains unexplored, making it imperative to investigate and understand the impact of the microenvironment on the cellular states of GBM. The study compares single-cell RNA-sequencing of tumor cells from different patient-specific GSC-derived model types to understand the cellular states and their plasticity in GBM. The findings demonstrate the critical and sufficient contribution of a neuroanatomically accurate human microenvironment for recapitulating the cellular states found in human primary GBMs, which may have implications for other tumor models.

The ideal platform would enable rapid screening of        cell type-specific drug sensitivities directly in patient tumor tissue and reveal        strategies to overcome intratumoral heterogeneity. METHODS: We combine        multiplexed drug perturbation in acute slice culture from freshly resected tumors        with single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to profile transcriptome-wide drug        responses in individual patients. We applied this approach to drug perturbations        on slices derived from six glioblastoma (GBM) resections to identify conserved        drug responses and to one additional GBM resection to identify patient-specific        responses. RESULTS: We used scRNA-seq to demonstrate that acute slice cultures        recapitulate the cellular and molecular features of the originating tumor tissue        and the feasibility of drug screening from an individual tumor. Detailed        investigation of etoposide, a topoisomerase poison, and the histone deacetylase        (HDAC) inhibitor panobinostat in acute slice cultures revealed cell type-specific        responses across multiple patients. Etoposide has a conserved impact on        proliferating tumor cells, while panobinostat treatment affects both tumor and        non-tumor populations, including unexpected effects on the immune        microenvironment. CONCLUSIONS: Acute slice cultures recapitulate the major        cellular and molecular features of GBM at the single-cell level.

The experimental process involved the profiling of viable cells enriched for CD45− cells from GBM and IDH-MUT glioma primary patient samples using multimodality single-cell sequencing of DNA methylation (scDNAme) by multiplexed single-cell reduced-representation bisulfite. This high-resolution CNA mapping by single-cell multiomics approach allowed for the identification of key switches for state transitions, highlighting dysregulated epigenetic mechanisms underlying gliomagenesis.

The researchers also performed multiomics single-cell profiling, integrating DNA methylation, transcriptome, and genotype within the same cells of diffuse gliomas. They developed a quantitative framework to directly measure cell state heritability and transition dynamics based on high-resolution lineage trees in human samples, demonstrating heritability of malignant cell states and differences in hierarchal and plastic cell state architectures in IDH-mutant glioma versus IDH-wild-type glioblastoma.

The study leveraged single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to systematically interrogate the diversity of malignant and normal cell states, highlighting transcriptional cancer cell states' diversity. The research also involved the development of a classifier to assign each sample to its expected DNA methylation subtype, providing insights into the heterogeneity and classification of GBM tumors based on DNA methylation profiles.

In summary, the literature review in the article provides a comprehensive overview of the experimental methods, processes, and results related to deciphering the heterogeneity and dynamics of the tumor microenvironment in GBM using single-cell RNA sequencing. The study presents novel insights into the genetic and epigenetic mechanisms underlying gliomagenesis, emphasizing the need for additional technological and analytical breakthroughs in this field.

The ideal platform would enable rapid screening of        cell type-specific drug sensitivities directly in patient tumor tissue and reveal        strategies to overcome intratumoral heterogeneity. METHODS: We combine        multiplexed drug perturbation in acute slice culture from freshly resected tumors        with single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to profile transcriptome-wide drug        responses in individual patients. We applied this approach to drug perturbations        on slices derived from six glioblastoma (GBM) resections to identify conserved        drug responses and to one additional GBM resection to identify patient-specific        responses. RESULTS: We used scRNA-seq to demonstrate that acute slice cultures        recapitulate the cellular and molecular features of the originating tumor tissue        and the feasibility of drug screening from an individual tumor. Detailed        investigation of etoposide, a topoisomerase poison, and the histone deacetylase        (HDAC) inhibitor panobinostat in acute slice cultures revealed cell type-specific        responses across multiple patients. Etoposide has a conserved impact on        proliferating tumor cells, while panobinostat treatment affects both tumor and        non-tumor populations, including unexpected effects on the immune        microenvironment. CONCLUSIONS: Acute slice cultures recapitulate the major        cellular and molecular features of GBM at the single-cell level. In combination        with scRNA-seq, this approach enables cell type-specific analysis of sensitivity        to multiple drugs in individual tumors.

To address this, here we performed multiomics single-cell        profiling-integrating DNA methylation, transcriptome and genotype within the same        cells-of diffuse gliomas, tumors characterized by defined transcriptional cell        state diversity. Direct comparison of the epigenetic profiles of distinct cell        states revealed key switches for state transitions recapitulating        neurodevelopmental trajectories and highlighted dysregulated epigenetic        mechanisms underlying gliomagenesis. We further developed a quantitative        framework to directly measure cell state heritability and transition dynamics        based on high-resolution lineage trees in human samples. We demonstrated        heritability of malignant cell states, with key differences in hierarchal and        plastic cell state architectures in IDH-mutant glioma versus IDH-wild-type        glioblastoma, respectively.

The ability of current tumor models to recapitulate the cellular states found in primary tumors remains unexplored. To address this issue, we compared single-cell RNA sequencing of tumor cells from 5 patients across four patient-specific glioblastoma stem cell (GSC)-derived model types, including glioma spheres, tumor organoids, glioblastoma cerebral organoids (GLICO), and patient-derived xenografts. We find that GSCs within the GLICO model are enriched for a neural progenitor-like cell subpopulation and recapitulate the cellular states and their plasticity found in the corresponding primary parental tumors. These data demonstrate how the contribution of a neuroanatomically accurate human microenvironment is critical and sufficient for recapitulating the cellular states found in human primary GBMs, a principle that may likely apply to other tumor models.

The ability of current tumor models to recapitulate the cellular states found in primary tumors remains unexplored. To address this issue, we compared single-cell RNA sequencing of tumor cells from 5 patients across four patient-specific glioblastoma stem cell (GSC)-derived model types, including glioma spheres, tumor organoids, glioblastoma cerebral organoids (GLICO), and patient-derived xenografts. We find that GSCs within the GLICO model are enriched for a neural progenitor-like cell subpopulation and recapitulate the cellular states and their plasticity found in the corresponding primary parental tumors. These data demonstrate how the contribution of a neuroanatomically accurate human microenvironment is critical and sufficient for recapitulating the cellular states found in human primary GBMs, a principle that may likely apply to other tumor models.

METHODS: Here, we utilized high-resolution mass spectrometry imaging        (HR-MSI) to interrogate the proteomic landscape of GBM at the single-cell level.        We discovered that single-cell proteomic data align along three axes: the distance        from the tumor margin, the presence of immune infiltration, and cellular        heterogeneity.

The ideal platform would enable rapid screening of        cell type-specific drug sensitivities directly in patient tumor tissue and reveal        strategies to overcome intratumoral heterogeneity. METHODS: We combine        multiplexed drug perturbation in acute slice culture from freshly resected tumors        with single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to profile transcriptome-wide drug        responses in individual patients. We applied this approach to drug perturbations        on slices derived from six glioblastoma (GBM) resections to identify conserved        drug responses and to one additional GBM resection to identify patient-specific        responses. RESULTS: We used scRNA-seq to demonstrate that acute slice cultures        recapitulate the cellular and molecular features of the originating tumor tissue        and the feasibility of drug screening from an individual tumor. Detailed        investigation of etoposide, a topoisomerase poison, and the histone deacetylase        (HDAC) inhibitor panobinostat in acute slice cultures revealed cell type-specific        responses across multiple patients. Etoposide has a conserved impact on        proliferating tumor cells, while panobinostat treatment affects both tumor and        non-tumor populations, including unexpected effects on the immune        microenvironment. CONCLUSIONS: Acute slice cultures recapitulate the major        cellular and molecular features of GBM at the single-cell level. In combination        with scRNA-seq, this approach enables cell type-specific analysis of sensitivity        to multiple drugs in individual tumors. We anticipate that this approach will        facilitate pre-clinical studies that identify effective therapies for solid        tumors.\n\nDOI: 10.1186/s13073-021-00894-y\nThe impact factor: 15.266\n\n\n\nPaper 2\nTitle: Epigenetic encoding, heritability and plasticity of glioma transcriptional cell        states.\n\nAbstract: Single-cell RNA sequencing has revealed extensive transcriptional cell state        diversity in cancer, often observed independently of genetic heterogeneity,        raising the central question of how malignant cell states are encoded        epigenetically. To address this, here we performed multiomics single-cell        profiling-integrating DNA methylation, transcriptome and genotype within the same        cells-of diffuse gliomas, tumors characterized by defined transcriptional cell        state diversity. Direct comparison of the epigenetic profiles of distinct cell        states revealed key switches for state transitions recapitulating        neurodevelopmental trajectories and highlighted dysregulated epigenetic        mechanisms underlying gliomagenesis. We further developed a quantitative        framework to directly measure cell state heritability and transition dynamics        based on high-resolution lineage trees in human samples. We demonstrated        heritability of malignant cell states, with key differences in hierarchal and        plastic cell state architectures in IDH-mutant glioma versus IDH-wild-type        glioblastoma, respectively. This work provides a framework anchoring        transcriptional cancer cell states in their epigenetic encoding, inheritance and        transition dynamics.\n\nDOI: 10.1038/s41588-021-00927-7\nThe impact factor: 41.307\n\n\n\nPaper 3\nTitle: Deciphering functional tumor states at single-cell resolution.\n\nAbstract: Within a tumor, cancer cells exist in different states that are associated with        distinct tumor functions, including proliferation, differentiation, invasion,        metastasis, and resistance to anti-cancer therapy. The identification of the gene        regulatory networks underpinning each state is essential for better understanding        functional tumor heterogeneity and revealing tumor vulnerabilities. Here, we        review the different studies identifying tumor states by single-cell sequencing        approaches and the mechanisms that promote and sustain these functional states        and regulate their transitions. We also describe how different tumor states are        spatially distributed and interact with the specific stromal cells that compose        the tumor microenvironment. Finally, we discuss how the understanding of tumor        plasticity and transition states can be used to develop new strategies to improve        cancer therapy.\n\nDOI: 10.15252/embj.2021109221\nThe impact factor: 14.012\n\n\n\nPaper 4\nTitle: Topographic mapping of the glioblastoma proteome reveals a triple-axis model of        intra-tumoral heterogeneity.\n\nAbstract: Glioblastoma is an aggressive form of brain cancer with well-established patterns        of intra-tumoral heterogeneity implicated in treatment resistance and        progression. While regional and single cell transcriptomic variations of        glioblastoma have been recently resolved, downstream phenotype-level proteomic        programs have yet to be assigned across glioblastoma's hallmark histomorphologic        niches. Here, we leverage mass spectrometry to spatially align abundance levels        of 4,794 proteins to distinct histologic patterns across 20 patients and propose        diverse molecular programs operational within these regional tumor compartments.        Using machine learning, we overlay concordant transcriptional information, and        define two distinct proteogenomic programs, MYC- and KRAS-axis hereon, that        cooperate with hypoxia to produce a tri-dimensional model of intra-tumoral        heterogeneity. Moreover, we highlight differential drug sensitivities and        relative chemoresistance in glioblastoma cell lines with enhanced KRAS programs.        Importantly, these pharmacological differences are less pronounced in        transcriptional glioblastoma subgroups suggesting that this model may provide        insights for targeting heterogeneity and overcoming therapy resistance.\n\nDOI: 10.1038/s41467-021-27667-w\nThe impact factor: 17.694\n\n\n\nPaper 5\nTitle: Cancer cell heterogeneity and plasticity: A paradigm shift in glioblastoma.\n\nAbstract: Phenotypic plasticity has emerged as a major contributor to intra-tumoral        heterogeneity and treatment resistance in cancer. Increasing evidence shows that        glioblastoma (GBM) cells display prominent intrinsic plasticity and reversibly        adapt to dynamic microenvironmental conditions. Limited genetic evolution at        recurrence further suggests that resistance mechanisms also largely operate at        the phenotypic level. Here we review recent literature underpinning the role of        GBM plasticity in creating gradients of heterogeneous cells including those that        carry cancer stem cell (CSC) properties. A historical perspective from the        hierarchical to the nonhierarchical concept of CSCs towards the recent        appreciation of GBM plasticity is provided. Cellular states interact dynamically        with each other and with the surrounding brain to shape a flexible tumor        ecosystem, which enables swift adaptation to external pressure including        treatment. We present the key components regulating intra-tumoral phenotypic        heterogeneity and the equilibrium of phenotypic states, including genetic,        epigenetic, and microenvironmental factors. We further discuss plasticity in the        context of intrinsic tumor resistance, where a variable balance between        preexisting resistant cells and adaptive persisters leads to reversible        adaptation upon treatment. Innovative efforts targeting regulators of plasticity        and mechanisms of state transitions towards treatment-resistant states are needed        to restrict the adaptive capacities of GBM.\n\nDOI: 10.1093/neuonc/noab269\nThe impact factor: 13.029\n\n\n\nPaper 6\nTitle: Decoding Cancer Biology One Cell at a Time.\n\nAbstract: Human tumors are composed of diverse malignant and nonmalignant cells, generating        a complex ecosystem that governs tumor biology and response to treatments. Recent        technological advances have enabled the characterization of tumors at single-cell        resolution, providing a compelling strategy to dissect their intricate biology.        Here we describe recent developments in single-cell expression profiling and the        studies applying them in clinical settings. We highlight some of the powerful        insights gleaned from these studies for tumor classification, stem cell programs,        tumor microenvironment, metastasis, and response to targeted and immune        therapies. SIGNIFICANCE: Intratumor heterogeneity (ITH) has been a major barrier        to our understanding of cancer. Single-cell genomics is leading a revolution in        our ability to systematically dissect ITH.

Brain cancers are cultivated by a dynamic population        of stem-like cells that enforce intratumoural heterogeneity and respond to        intrinsic microenvironment or therapeutically guided insults through        proliferation, plasticity and restructuring of neoplastic and stromal components.        Far from a rigid hierarchy, heterogeneous neoplastic populations transition        between cellular states with differential self-renewal capacities, endowing them        with powerful resilience. Here we review the biological machinery used by brain        tumour stem cells to commandeer tissues in the intracranial space, evade immune        responses and resist chemoradiotherapy. Through recent advances in single-cell        sequencing, improved models to investigate the role of the tumour        microenvironment and a deeper understanding of the fundamental role of the immune        system in cancer biology, we are now better equipped to explore mechanisms by        which these processes can be exploited for therapeutic benefit.\n\nDOI: 10.1038/s41568-022-00486-x\nThe impact factor: 69.8\n\n\n\nPaper 8\nTitle: The evolution of the cancer stem cell state in glioblastoma: emerging insights        into the next generation of functional interactions.\n\nAbstract: Cellular heterogeneity is a hallmark of advanced cancers and has been ascribed in        part to a population of self-renewing, therapeutically resistant cancer stem        cells (CSCs). Glioblastoma (GBM), the most common primary malignant brain tumor,        has served as a platform for the study of CSCs. In addition to illustrating the        complexities of CSC biology, these investigations have led to a deeper        understanding of GBM pathogenesis, revealed novel therapeutic targets, and driven        innovation towards the development of next-generation therapies. While there        continues to be an expansion in our knowledge of how CSCs contribute to GBM        progression, opportunities have emerged to revisit this conceptual framework. In        this review, we will summarize the current state of CSCs in GBM using key        concepts of evolution as a paradigm (variation, inheritance, selection, and time)        to describe how the CSC state is subject to alterations of cell intrinsic and        extrinsic interactions that shape their evolutionarily trajectory. We identify        emerging areas for future consideration, including appreciating CSCs as a cell        state that is subject to plasticity, as opposed to a discrete population. These        future considerations will not only have an impact on our understanding of this        ever-expanding field but will also provide an opportunity to inform future        therapies to effectively treat this complex and devastating disease.\n\nDOI: 10.1093/neuonc/noaa259\nThe impact factor: 13.029\n\n\n\nPaper 9\nTitle: Cellular Plasticity and Tumor Microenvironment in Gliomas: The Struggle to Hit a        Moving Target.\n\nAbstract: Brain tumors encompass a diverse group of neoplasias arising from different cell        lineages. Tumors of glial origin have been the subject of intense research        because of their rapid and fatal progression. From a clinical point of view,        complete surgical resection of gliomas is highly difficult. Moreover, the        remaining tumor cells are resistant to traditional therapies such as radio- or        chemotherapy and tumors always recur. Here we have revised the new genetic and        epigenetic classification of gliomas and the description of the different        transcriptional subtypes. In order to understand the progression of the different        gliomas we have focused on the interaction of the plastic tumor cells with their        vasculature-rich microenvironment and with their distinct immune system. We        believe that a comprehensive characterization of the glioma microenvironment will        shed some light into why these tumors behave differently from other cancers.        Furthermore, a novel classification of gliomas that could integrate the genetic        background and the cellular ecosystems could have profound implications in the        efficiency of current therapies as well as in the development of new treatments.\n\nDOI: 10.3390/cancers12061622\nThe impact factor: 6.575\n\n\n\nPaper 10\nTitle: Disconnecting multicellular networks in brain tumours.\n\nAbstract: Cancer cells can organize and communicate in functional networks. Similarly to        other networks in biology and sociology, these can be highly relevant for growth        and resilience. In this Perspective, we demonstrate by the example of        glioblastomas and other incurable brain tumours how versatile multicellular        tumour networks are formed by two classes of long intercellular membrane        protrusions: tumour microtubes and tunnelling nanotubes. The resulting networks        drive tumour growth and resistance to standard therapies. This raises the        question of how to disconnect brain tumour networks to halt tumour growth and        whether this can make established therapies more effective. Emerging principles        of tumour networks, their potential relevance for tumour types outside the brain        and translational implications, including clinical trials that are already based        on these discoveries, are discussed.\n\nDOI: 10.1038/s41568-022-00475-0\nThe impact factor: 69.8\n\n\n\n"}

The rapid development of omics technologies and personalized medicine, along with the availability of labeled omics datasets, has highlighted the need for novel computational methods to integrate and analyze multi-omics data for biomedical classification tasks. The research focuses on addressing this need through the introduction of Multi-Omics Graph cOnvolutional NETworks (MOGONET), a supervised multi-omics integration method based on deep multi-view learning. MOGONET utilizes graph convolutional networks (GCNs) for omics-specific learning and a high-level label space integration approach using the Virtual Cross-Omics Data Network (VCDN). The importance and significance of MOGONET are demonstrated through its outperformance of other state-of-the-art methods in various biomedical classification applications, including Alzheimer's disease patient classification, tumor grade classification in low-grade glioma, kidney cancer type classification, and breast invasive carcinoma subtype classification. Furthermore, MOGONET's ability to identify important biomarkers from different omics data types related to the investigated biomedical problems underscores its potential impact on early detection of complex diseases such as cancer. The necessity of integrating multiple omics data types and the importance of combining both GCN and VCDN for multi-omics data classification are emphasized through comprehensive ablation studies. Moreover, the research highlights the essential role of identifying biomarkers for interpreting results and understanding the underlying biology in biomedical applications, which MOGONET effectively addresses. In summary, the introduction of MOGONET as an innovative deep learning-based multi-omics classification algorithm holds great promise for advancing early detection of complex diseases and personalized medicine.

This is an attractive approach for integrative joint analysis        of vast amounts of omics data produced in next generation sequencing and other        -omics assays. A systematic assessment of the current literature can help to        identify key trends and potential gaps in methodology and applications. We        surveyed the literature on ML multi-omic data integration and quantitatively        explored the goals, techniques and data involved in this field. We were        particularly interested in examining how researchers use ML to deal with the        volume and complexity of these datasets. RESULTS: Our main finding is that the        methods used are those that address the challenges of datasets with few samples        and many features. Dimensionality reduction methods are used to reduce the        feature count alongside models that can also appropriately handle relatively few        samples. Popular techniques include autoencoders, random forests and support        vector machines.

The introduction of deep learning        has significantly advanced the analysis of biomedical data. However, most        approaches focus on single data modalities leading to slow progress in methods to        integrate complementary data types. Development of effective multimodal fusion        approaches is becoming increasingly important as a single modality might not be        consistent and sufficient to capture the heterogeneity of complex diseases to        tailor medical care and improve personalised medicine. Many initiatives now focus        on integrating these disparate modalities to unravel the biological processes        involved in multifactorial diseases such as cancer. However, many obstacles        remain, including lack of usable data as well as methods for clinical validation        and interpretation.

Furthermore, the article acknowledges that existing efforts in multi-omics data integration have mainly focused on unsupervised approaches, indicating a potential gap in the current research landscape.

In comparison to other studies in related fields, MOGONET stands out as one of the first supervised multi-omics integrative methods that utilizes GCNs for omics data learning, showcasing its innovative approach and potential for further advancements in the field. The significance of the results lies in the demonstrated capabilities and versatility of MOGONET, as well as its ability to identify important omics signatures and biomarkers, contributing to the development of integrative analysis methods for multi-omics data in the context of complex diseases.

Moving forward, future research directions could involve addressing the limitations of MOGONET by exploring opportunities to enhance the method's ability to exploit sample correlations effectively, possibly through the integration of unsupervised approaches. Additionally, further investigation into the potential applications of MOGONET in other complex diseases beyond those mentioned in the article could expand its utility and impact within the field of integrative genomics and multi-omics data analysis.

This review focuses on the recent        development of ML/DL methods to provide integrative solutions in discovering        cancer-related biomarkers, and their utilization in precision medicine.', "BACKGROUND: A fused method using a combination of multi-omics data enables a        comprehensive study of complex biological processes and highlights the        interrelationship of relevant biomolecules and their functions. Driven by        high-throughput sequencing technologies, several promising deep learning methods        have been proposed for fusing multi-omics data generated from a large number of        samples. RESULTS: In this study, 16 representative deep learning methods are        comprehensively evaluated on simulated, single-cell, and cancer multi-omics        datasets. For each of the datasets, two tasks are designed: classification and        clustering. The classification performance is evaluated by using three        benchmarking metrics including accuracy, F1 macro, and F1 weighted. Meanwhile,        the clustering performance is evaluated by using four benchmarking metrics        including the Jaccard index (JI), C-index, silhouette score, and Davies Bouldin        score. For the cancer multi-omics datasets, the methods' strength in capturing        the association of multi-omics dimensionality reduction results with survival and        clinical annotations is further evaluated. The benchmarking results indicate that        moGAT achieves the best classification performance. Meanwhile, efmmdVAE, efVAE,        and lfmmdVAE show the most promising performance across all complementary        contexts in clustering tasks.

We also found that the field is heavily influenced by the use of        The Cancer Genome Atlas dataset, which is accessible and contains many diverse        experiments.

In        oncology, massive amounts of data are being generated ranging from molecular,        histopathology, radiology to clinical records. The introduction of deep learning        has significantly advanced the analysis of biomedical data. However, most        approaches focus on single data modalities leading to slow progress in methods to        integrate complementary data types. Development of effective multimodal fusion        approaches is becoming increasingly important as a single modality might not be        consistent and sufficient to capture the heterogeneity of complex diseases to        tailor medical care and improve personalised medicine. Many initiatives now focus        on integrating these disparate modalities to unravel the biological processes        involved in multifactorial diseases such as cancer. However, many obstacles        remain, including lack of usable data as well as methods for clinical validation        and interpretation. Here, we cover these current challenges and reflect on        opportunities through deep learning to tackle data sparsity and scarcity,        multimodal interpretability, and standardisation of datasets.\n\nDOI: 10.1038/s42256-023-00633-5\nThe impact factor: 25.898\n\n\n\nPaper 3\nTitle: Deep learning facilitates multi-data type analysis and predictive biomarker        discovery in cancer precision medicine.\n\nAbstract: Cancer progression is linked to gene-environment interactions that alter cellular        homeostasis. The use of biomarkers as early indicators of disease manifestation        and progression can substantially improve diagnosis and treatment. Large omics        datasets generated by high-throughput profiling technologies, such as        microarrays, RNA sequencing, whole-genome shotgun sequencing, nuclear magnetic        resonance, and mass spectrometry, have enabled data-driven biomarker discoveries.        The identification of differentially expressed traits as molecular markers has        traditionally relied on statistical techniques that are often limited to linear        parametric modeling. The heterogeneity, epigenetic changes, and high degree of        polymorphism observed in oncogenes demand biomarker-assisted personalized        medication schemes. Deep learning (DL), a major subunit of machine learning (ML),        has been increasingly utilized in recent years to investigate various diseases.        The combination of ML/DL approaches for performance optimization across        multi-omics datasets produces robust ensemble-learning prediction models, which        are becoming useful in precision medicine. This review focuses on the recent        development of ML/DL methods to provide integrative solutions in discovering        cancer-related biomarkers, and their utilization in precision medicine.\n\nDOI: 10.1016/j.csbj.2023.01.043\nThe impact factor: 6.155\n\n\n\nPaper 4\nTitle: A benchmark study of deep learning-based multi-omics data fusion methods for        cancer.\n\nAbstract: BACKGROUND: A fused method using a combination of multi-omics data enables a        comprehensive study of complex biological processes and highlights the        interrelationship of relevant biomolecules and their functions. Driven by        high-throughput sequencing technologies, several promising deep learning methods        have been proposed for fusing multi-omics data generated from a large number of        samples. RESULTS: In this study, 16 representative deep learning methods are        comprehensively evaluated on simulated, single-cell, and cancer multi-omics        datasets. For each of the datasets, two tasks are designed: classification and        clustering. The classification performance is evaluated by using three        benchmarking metrics including accuracy, F1 macro, and F1 weighted. Meanwhile,        the clustering performance is evaluated by using four benchmarking metrics        including the Jaccard index (JI), C-index, silhouette score, and Davies Bouldin        score. For the cancer multi-omics datasets, the methods' strength in capturing        the association of multi-omics dimensionality reduction results with survival and        clinical annotations is further evaluated. The benchmarking results indicate that        moGAT achieves the best classification performance. Meanwhile, efmmdVAE, efVAE,        and lfmmdVAE show the most promising performance across all complementary        contexts in clustering tasks. CONCLUSIONS: Our benchmarking results not only        provide a reference for biomedical researchers to choose appropriate deep        learning-based multi-omics data fusion methods, but also suggest the future        directions for the development of more effective multi-omics data fusion methods.

Despite this, multi-omics        data have rarely been applied to non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) diagnosis. We        developed a multi-omics data-affinitive artificial intelligence algorithm based        on the graph convolutional network that integrates mRNA expression, DNA        methylation, and DNA sequencing data. This NSCLC prediction model achieved a        93.7% macro F1-score, indicating that values for false positives and negatives        were substantially low, which is desirable for accurate classification. Gene        ontology enrichment and pathway analysis of features revealed that two major        subtypes of NSCLC, lung adenocarcinoma and lung squamous cell carcinoma, have        both specific and common GO biological processes. Numerous biomarkers (i.e.,        microRNA, long non-coding RNA, differentially methylated regions) were newly        identified, whereas some biomarkers were consistent with previous findings in        NSCLC (e.g., SPRR1B). Thus, using multi-omics data integration, we developed a        promising cancer prediction algorithm.\n\nDOI: 10.3390/biom12121839\nThe impact factor: 6.064\n\n\n\nPaper 6\nTitle: Machine Learning: A New Prospect in Multi-Omics Data Analysis of Cancer.\n\nAbstract: Cancer is defined as a large group of diseases that is associated with abnormal        cell growth, uncontrollable cell division, and may tend to impinge on other        tissues of the body by different mechanisms through metastasis. What makes cancer        so important is that the cancer incidence rate is growing worldwide which can        have major health, economic, and even social impacts on both patients and the        governments. Thereby, the early cancer prognosis, diagnosis, and treatment can        play a crucial role at the front line of combating cancer. The onset and        progression of cancer can occur under the influence of complicated mechanisms and        some alterations in the level of genome, proteome, transcriptome, metabolome etc.        Consequently, the advent of omics science and its broad research branches (such        as genomics, proteomics, transcriptomics, metabolomics, and so forth) as        revolutionary biological approaches have opened new doors to the comprehensive        perception of the cancer landscape. Due to the complexities of the formation and        development of cancer, the study of mechanisms underlying cancer has gone beyond        just one field of the omics arena. Therefore, making a connection between the        resultant data from different branches of omics science and examining them in a        multi-omics field can pave the way for facilitating the discovery of novel        prognostic, diagnostic, and therapeutic approaches. As the volume and complexity        of data from the omics studies in cancer are increasing dramatically, the use of        leading-edge technologies such as machine learning can have a promising role in        the assessments of cancer research resultant data. Machine learning is        categorized as a subset of artificial intelligence which aims to data parsing,        classification, and data pattern identification by applying statistical methods        and algorithms. This acquired knowledge subsequently allows computers to learn        and improve accurate predictions through experiences from data processing. In        this context, the application of machine learning, as a novel computational        technology offers new opportunities for achieving in-depth knowledge of cancer by        analysis of resultant data from multi-omics studies. Therefore, it can be        concluded that the use of artificial intelligence technologies such as machine        learning can have revolutionary roles in the fight against cancer.\n\nDOI: 10.3389/fgene.2022.824451\nThe impact factor: 4.772\n\n\n\nPaper 7\nTitle: Integrative omics approaches for biosynthetic pathway discovery in plants.\n\nAbstract: Covering: up to 2022With the emergence of large amounts of omics data,        computational approaches for the identification of plant natural product        biosynthetic pathways and their genetic regulation have become increasingly        important. While genomes provide clues regarding functional associations between        genes based on gene clustering, metabolome mining provides a foundational        technology to chart natural product structural diversity in plants, and        transcriptomics has been successfully used to identify new members of their        biosynthetic pathways based on coexpression. Thus far, most approaches utilizing        transcriptomics and metabolomics have been targeted towards specific pathways and        use one type of omics data at a time. Recent technological advances now provide        new opportunities for integration of multiple omics types and untargeted pathway        discovery. Here, we review advances in plant biosynthetic pathway discovery using        genomics, transcriptomics, and metabolomics, as well as recent efforts towards        omics integration. We highlight how transcriptomics and metabolomics provide        complementary information to link genes to metabolites, by associating temporal        and spatial gene expression levels with metabolite abundance levels across        samples, and by matching mass-spectral features to enzyme families. Furthermore,        we suggest that elucidation of gene regulatory networks using time-series data        may prove useful for efforts to unwire the complexities of biosynthetic pathway        components based on regulatory interactions and events.\n\nDOI: 10.1039/d2np00032f\nThe impact factor: 15.111\n\n\n\nPaper 8\nTitle: A guide to multi-omics data collection and integration for translational        medicine.\n\nAbstract: The emerging high-throughput technologies have led to the shift in the design of        translational medicine projects towards collecting multi-omics patient samples        and, consequently, their integrated analysis. However, the complexity of        integrating these datasets has triggered new questions regarding the        appropriateness of the available computational methods. Currently, there is no        clear consensus on the best combination of omics to include and the data        integration methodologies required for their analysis. This article aims to guide        the design of multi-omics studies in the field of translational medicine        regarding the types of omics and the integration method to choose. We review        articles that perform the integration of multiple omics measurements from patient        samples. We identify five objectives in translational medicine applications: (i)        detect disease-associated molecular patterns, (ii) subtype identification, (iii)        diagnosis/prognosis, (iv) drug response prediction, and (v) understand regulatory        processes. We describe common trends in the selection of omic types combined for        different objectives and diseases. To guide the choice of data integration tools,        we group them into the scientific objectives they aim to address. We describe the        main computational methods adopted to achieve these objectives and present        examples of tools. We compare tools based on how they deal with the computational        challenges of data integration and comment on how they perform against predefined        objective-specific evaluation criteria. Finally, we discuss examples of tools for        downstream analysis and further extraction of novel insights from multi-omics        datasets.\n\nDOI: 10.1016/j.csbj.2022.11.050\nThe impact factor: 6.155\n\n\n\nPaper 9\nTitle: A review of multi-omics data integration through deep learning approaches for        disease diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment.\n\nAbstract: Accurate diagnosis is the key to providing prompt and explicit treatment and        disease management. The recognized biological method for the molecular diagnosis        of infectious pathogens is polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Recently, deep        learning approaches are playing a vital role in accurately identifying        disease-related genes for diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment. The models reduce        the time and cost used by wet-lab experimental procedures. Consequently,        sophisticated computational approaches have been developed to facilitate the        detection of cancer, a leading cause of death globally, and other complex        diseases. In this review, we systematically evaluate the recent trends in        multi-omics data analysis based on deep learning techniques and their application        in disease prediction. We highlight the current challenges in the field and        discuss how advances in deep learning methods and their optimization for        application is vital in overcoming them. Ultimately, this review promotes the        development of novel deep-learning methodologies for data integration, which is        essential for disease detection and treatment.\n\nDOI: 10.3389/fgene.2023.1199087\nThe impact factor: 4.772\n\n\n\nPaper 10\nTitle: Artificial intelligence in cancer target identification and drug discovery.\n\nAbstract: Artificial intelligence is an advanced method to identify novel anticancer        targets and discover novel drugs from biology networks because the networks can        effectively preserve and quantify the interaction between components of cell        systems underlying human diseases such as cancer. Here, we review and discuss how        to employ artificial intelligence approaches to identify novel anticancer targets        and discover drugs. First, we describe the scope of artificial intelligence        biology analysis for novel anticancer target investigations. Second, we review        and discuss the basic principles and theory of commonly used network-based and        machine learning-based artificial intelligence algorithms. Finally, we showcase        the applications of artificial intelligence approaches in cancer target        identification and drug discovery. Taken together, the artificial intelligence        models have provided us with a quantitative framework to study the relationship        between network characteristics and cancer, thereby leading to the identification        of potential anticancer targets and the discovery of novel drug candidates.\n\nDOI: 10.1038/s41392-022-00994-0\nThe impact factor: 38.104\n\n\n\n"}
