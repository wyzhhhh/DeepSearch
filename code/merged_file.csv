10.3390/epigenomes8020014,Unveiling Gene Interactions in Alzheimer’s Disease by Integrating Genetic and Epigenetic Data with a Network-Based Approach,2024.0,"Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is a complex disease and the leading cause of dementia        in older people. We aimed to uncover aspects of AD's pathogenesis that may        contribute to drug repurposing efforts by integrating DNA methylation and genetic        data. Implementing the network-based tool, a dense module search of genome-wide        association studies (dmGWAS), we integrated a large-scale GWAS dataset with DNA        methylation data to identify gene network modules associated with AD. Our        analysis yielded 286 significant gene network modules. Notably, the foremost        module included the BIN1 gene, showing the largest GWAS signal, and the GNAS        gene, the most significantly hypermethylated. We conducted Web-based        Cell-type-Specific Enrichment Analysis (WebCSEA) on genes within the top 10% of        dmGWAS modules, highlighting monocyte as the most significant cell type (p < 5 ×        10(-12)). Functional enrichment analysis revealed Gene Ontology Biological        Process terms relevant to AD pathology (adjusted p < 0.05). Additionally, drug        target enrichment identified five FDA-approved targets (p-value = 0.03) for        further research. In summary, dmGWAS integration of genetic and epigenetic        signals unveiled new gene interactions related to AD, offering promising avenues        for future studies.",6975e84d9af84b8f14d50baa92e78501436ee059,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/6975e84d9af84b8f14d50baa92e78501436ee059,38651367,PMC11036294,background,False,Epigenomes,101736595
10.1002/mco2.532,Precise prediction of cerebrospinal fluid amyloid beta protein for early Alzheimer's disease detection using multimodal data,2024.0,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) constitutes a neurodegenerative disorder marked by a        progressive decline in cognitive function and memory capacity. The accurate        diagnosis of this condition predominantly relies on cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)        markers, notwithstanding the associated burdens of pain and substantial financial        costs endured by patients. This study encompasses subjects exhibiting varying        degrees of cognitive impairment, encompassing individuals with subjective        cognitive decline, mild cognitive impairment, and dementia, constituting a total        sample size of 82 participants. The primary objective of this investigation is to        explore the relationships among brain atrophy measurements derived from magnetic        resonance imaging, atypical electroencephalography (EEG) patterns, behavioral        assessment scales, and amyloid β-protein (Aβ) indicators. The findings of this        research reveal that individuals displaying reduced Aβ1-42/Aβ-40 levels exhibit        significant atrophy in the frontotemporal lobe, alongside irregularities in        various parameters related to EEG frequency characteristics, signal complexity,        inter-regional information exchange, and microstates. The study additionally        endeavors to estimate Aβ1-42/Aβ-40 content through the application of a random        forest algorithm, amalgamating structural data, electrophysiological features,        and clinical scales, achieving a remarkable predictive precision of 91.6%. In        summary, this study proposes a cost-effective methodology for acquiring CSF        markers, thereby offering a valuable tool for the early detection of AD.",20707d37a645d803da889a129aad4a5837202893,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/20707d37a645d803da889a129aad4a5837202893,38645663,PMC11027992,background,False,MedComm,101769925

The role of gut microbiota in Alzheimer's        disease is diverse and complex, evidence suggests lipid metabolism may be one of        the potential pathways. However, the mechanisms that gut microbiota mediate lipid        metabolism in Alzheimer's disease pathology remain unclear, necessitating further        investigation for clarification. This review highlights the current understanding        of how gut microbiota disrupts lipid metabolism and discusses the implications of        these discoveries in guiding strategies for the prevention or treatment of        Alzheimer's disease based on existing data.",78cdde4bb992d41d44e4e6a8ad1cecc548f9553c,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/78cdde4bb992d41d44e4e6a8ad1cecc548f9553c,38627829,PMC11020986,,False,Molecular neurodegeneration,101266600
10.1084/jem.20232000,Cholesterol 25-hydroxylase mediates neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration in a mouse model of tauopathy.,2024.0,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary        tangles, in addition to neuroinflammation and changes in brain lipid metabolism.        25-Hydroxycholesterol (25-HC), a known modulator of both inflammation and lipid        metabolism, is produced by cholesterol 25-hydroxylase encoded by Ch25h expressed        as a ""disease-associated microglia"" signature gene. However, whether Ch25h        influences tau-mediated neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration is unknown. Here,        we show that in the absence of Ch25h and the resultant reduction in 25-HC, there        is strikingly reduced age-dependent neurodegeneration and neuroinflammation in        the hippocampus and entorhinal/piriform cortex of PS19 mice, which express the        P301S mutant human tau transgene. Transcriptomic analyses of bulk hippocampal        tissue and single nuclei revealed that Ch25h deficiency in PS19 mice strongly        suppressed proinflammatory signaling in microglia. Our results suggest a key role        for Ch25h/25-HC in potentiating proinflammatory signaling to promote tau-mediated        neurodegeneration.

10.1007/s11033-023-09113-w,Gene expression patterns of CRYM and SIGLEC10 in Alzheimer's disease: potential early diagnostic indicators.,2024.0,"BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurological condition that may lead to        dementia as well as a slow and steady decline in cognitive ability. Finding early        signs that may be used in the diagnosis of AD is still a difficult aim to achieve        in the field of medical practice. METHODS AND RESULTS: The purpose of this        research was to investigate to determine any differences in the gene expression        patterns of crystallin mu (CRYM) and sialic acid-binding immunoglobulin-like        lectin 10 (SIGLEC10) in whole blood samples obtained from fifty individuals who        were diagnosed with AD and fifty individuals as a control group. When compared        with controls, it was discovered that the expression of the CRYM gene was        substantially decreased in AD patients, but the expression of the SIGLEC10 gene        was significantly higher. A positive correlation between CRYM and SIGLEC10 was        noticed solely in patients with AD. Furthermore, assessing the diagnostic value        of these genes, CRYM and SIGLEC10 transcript levels displayed an area under the        curve (AUC) of 0.74 and 0.81, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest        that alterations in CRYM and SIGLEC10 expression may be implicated in AD        pathology and that these genes expression levels can potentially serve as        biomarkers for early detection and diagnosis of AD. Nevertheless, further        validation of these findings requires the inclusion of more extensive and        heterogeneous cohorts.

Classically, BVRA is well known        for converting the heme metabolite biliverdin to bilirubin, which is a potent        antioxidant in both the periphery and the brain. However, BVRA additionally        participates in many neuroprotective signaling cascades in the brain that        preserve cognition.

10.1002/alz.13703,Silencing Apoe with divalent‐siRNAs improves amyloid burden and activates immune response pathways in Alzheimer's disease,2024.0,"INTRODUCTION: The most significant genetic risk factor for late-onset Alzheimer's        disease (AD) is APOE4, with evidence for gain- and loss-of-function mechanisms. A        clinical need remains for therapeutically relevant tools that potently modulate        APOE expression. METHODS: We optimized small interfering RNAs (di-siRNA, GalNAc)        to potently silence brain or liver Apoe and evaluated the impact of each pool of        Apoe on pathology. RESULTS: In adult 5xFAD mice, siRNAs targeting CNS Apoe        efficiently silenced Apoe expression and reduced amyloid burden without affecting        systemic cholesterol, confirming that potent silencing of brain Apoe is        sufficient to slow disease progression. Mechanistically, silencing Apoe reduced        APOE-rich amyloid cores and activated immune system responses. DISCUSSION: These        results establish siRNA-based modulation of Apoe as a viable therapeutic        approach, highlight immune activation as a key pathway affected by Apoe        modulation, and provide the technology to further evaluate the impact of APOE        silencing on neurodegeneration.",ffe73256b0b0b819bde2b5b0c7cb39e1d71e21ff,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/ffe73256b0b0b819bde2b5b0c7cb39e1d71e21ff,38375983,PMC11032532,,False,Alzheimer's & dementia : the journal of the Alzheimer's Association,101231978
10.1098/rstb.2022.0387,Endo-lysosomal dysfunction in neurodegenerative diseases: opinion on current progress and future direction in the use of exosomes as biomarkers,2024.0,"Over the past two decades, increased research has highlighted the connection        between endosomal trafficking defects and neurodegeneration. The endo-lysosomal        network is an important, complex cellular system specialized in the transport of        proteins, lipids, and other metabolites, essential for cell homeostasis.        Disruption of this pathway is linked to a wide range of neurodegenerative        diseases, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, amyotrophic lateral        sclerosis, Huntington's disease and frontotemporal dementia. Furthermore, there        is strong evidence that defects in this pathway create opportunities for        diagnostic and therapeutic intervention. In this Opinion piece, we concisely        address the role of endo-lysosomal dysfunction in five neurodegenerative diseases        and discuss how future research can investigate this intracellular pathway,        including extracellular vesicles with a specific focus on exosomes for the        identification of novel disease biomarkers.

10.1098/rstb.2022.0389,Differential effects of SORL1 deficiency on the endo-lysosomal network in human neurons and microglia,2024.0,"The endosomal gene SORL1 is a strong Alzheimer's disease (AD) risk gene that        harbours loss-of-function variants causative for developing AD. The SORL1 protein        SORL1/SORLA is an endosomal receptor that interacts with the multi-protein        sorting complex retromer to traffic various cargo through the endo-lysosomal        network (ELN). Impairments in endo-lysosomal trafficking are an early cellular        symptom in AD and a novel therapeutic target. However, the cell types of the        central nervous system are diverse and use the ELN differently. If this pathway        is to be effectively therapeutically targeted, understanding how key molecules in        the ELN function in various cell types and how manipulating them affects        cell-type specific responses relative to AD is essential. Here, we discuss an        example where deficiency of SORL1 expression in a human model leads to stress on        early endosomes and recycling endosomes in neurons, but preferentially leads to        stress on lysosomes in microglia. The differences observed in these organelles        could relate to the unique roles of these cells in the brain as neurons are        professional secretory cells and microglia are professional phagocytic cells.        Experiments to untangle these differences are fundamental to advancing the        understanding of cell biology in AD and elucidating important pathways for        therapeutic development.

Here we report the selective enrichment of microglia clones carrying        pathogenic variants, that are not present in neuronal, glia/stromal cells, or        blood, from patients with AD in comparison to age-matched controls. Notably,        microglia-specific AD-associated variants preferentially target the MAPK pathway,        including recurrent CBL ring-domain mutations. These variants activate ERK and        drive a microglia transcriptional program characterized by a strong        neuro-inflammatory response, both in vitro and in patients. Although the natural        history of AD-associated microglial clones is difficult to establish in human,        microglial expression of a MAPK pathway activating variant was previously shown        to cause neurodegeneration in mice, suggesting that AD-associated        neuroinflammatory microglial clones may contribute to the neurodegenerative        process in patients.",2d47edbabebdf07a22567ff210ded29a49e6ee1d,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/2d47edbabebdf07a22567ff210ded29a49e6ee1d,38328106,PMC10849735,,False,bioRxiv : the preprint server for biology,101680187

Selenium (Se) compounds show promise in AD treatment. Here, we        revealed that selenoprotein K (SELENOK), a selenoprotein involved in immune        regulation and potentially related to AD pathology, plays a critical role in        microglial immune response, migration, and phagocytosis. In vivo and in vitro        studies corroborated that SELENOK deficiency inhibits microglial Aβ phagocytosis,        exacerbating cognitive deficits in 5xFAD mice, which are reversed by SELENOK        overexpression. Mechanistically, SELENOK is involved in CD36 palmitoylation        through DHHC6, regulating CD36 localization to microglial plasma membranes and        thus impacting Aβ phagocytosis. CD36 palmitoylation was reduced in the brains of        patients and mice with AD. Se supplementation promoted SELENOK expression and        CD36 palmitoylation, enhancing microglial Aβ phagocytosis and mitigating AD        progression.

AD is characterized by two neuropathologically molecular hallmarks        of hyperphosphorylated tau and amyloid-β (Aβ), the latter generated by several        biochemically reactive enzymes, including γ-secretase. However, how infectious        risk factors contribute to pathological development of the AD core molecules        remains to be addressed. In this work, we utilized a modified herpes simplex        virus type 1 (mHSV-1) and found that its hippocampal infection locally promotes        Aβ pathology in 5 × FAD mice, the commonly used amyloid model. Mechanistically,        we identified HSV-1 membrane glycoprotein US7 (Envelope gI) that interacts with        and modulates γ-secretase and consequently facilitates Aβ production.        Furthermore, we presented evidence that adenovirus-associated virus-mediated        locally hippocampal overexpression of the US7 aggravates Aβ pathology in 5 × FAD        mice.

10.1212/NXG.0000000000200120,Machine Learning Models of Polygenic Risk for Enhanced Prediction of Alzheimer Disease Endophenotypes,2024.0,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Alzheimer disease (AD) has a polygenic architecture,        for which genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have helped elucidate sequence        variants (SVs) influencing susceptibility. Polygenic risk score (PRS) approaches        show promise for generating summary measures of inherited risk for clinical AD        based on the effects of APOE and other GWAS hits. However, existing PRS        approaches, based on traditional regression models, explain only modest variation        in AD dementia risk and AD-related endophenotypes. We hypothesized that machine        learning (ML) models of polygenic risk (ML-PRS) could outperform standard        regression-based PRS methods and therefore have the potential for greater        clinical utility. METHODS: We analyzed combined data from the Mayo Clinic Study        of Aging (n = 1,791) and the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (n =        864). An AD PRS was computed for each participant using the top common SVs        obtained from a large AD dementia GWAS. In parallel, ML models were trained using        those SV genotypes, with amyloid PET burden as the primary outcome. Secondary        outcomes included amyloid PET positivity and clinical diagnosis (cognitively        unimpaired vs impaired). We compared performance between ML-PRS and standard PRS        across 100 training sessions with different data splits. In each session, data        were split into 80% training and 20% testing, and then five-fold cross-validation        was used within the training set to ensure the best model was produced for        testing. We also applied permutation importance techniques to assess which        genetic factors contributed most to outcome prediction. RESULTS: ML-PRS models        outperformed the AD PRS (r(2) = 0.28 vs r(2) = 0.24 in test set) in explaining        variation in amyloid PET burden. Among ML approaches, methods accounting for        nonlinear genetic influences were superior to linear methods. ML-PRS models were        also more accurate when predicting amyloid PET positivity (area under the curve        [AUC] = 0.80 vs AUC = 0.63) and the presence of cognitive impairment (AUC = 0.75        vs AUC = 0.54) compared with the standard PRS. DISCUSSION: We found that ML-PRS        approaches improved upon standard PRS for prediction of AD endophenotypes, partly        related to improved accounting for nonlinear effects of genetic susceptibility        alleles. Further adaptations of the ML-PRS framework could help to close the gap        of remaining unexplained heritability for AD and therefore facilitate more        accurate presymptomatic and early-stage risk stratification for clinical        decision-making.",07b663ca3c6ed4d7b5f66fe19b02eb9d17b43928,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/07b663ca3c6ed4d7b5f66fe19b02eb9d17b43928,38250184,PMC10798228,,False,Neurology.

We assessed the relationship between        single-variant associations and expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) in 44        tissues and methylation quantitative trait loci (meQTLs) in the hippocampus. We        determined the relationship between gene associations and transcript levels in 53        tissues, annotation as immune genes, and regulation by transcription factors        (TFs) and microRNAs. To identify significant pathways, gene set enrichment was        tested in each cohort and meta-analyzed across cohorts. Analyses of differential        expression in brain tissues were conducted for pathway component genes. RESULTS:        The single-variant associations of VDM showed significant linkage disequilibrium        (LD) with eQTLs across all tissues and meQTLs within the hippocampus. Stronger        WL-dr gene associations correlated with reduced expression in four brain tissues,        including the hippocampus.

METHODS: We        retrieved articles on GWAS in AD published between 2002 and 2022 from Web of        Science. CiteSpace and VOSviewer software were applied to analyze the articles        for the number of articles published, countries/regions and institutions of        publication, authors and cited authors, highly cited literature, and research        hotspots. RESULTS: We retrieved a total of 2,751 articles. The United States had        the highest number of publications in this field, and Columbia University was the        institution with the most published articles. The identification of AD-related        susceptibility genes and their effects on AD is one of the current research        hotspots. Numerous risk genes have been identified, among which APOE, CLU, CD2AP,        CD33, EPHA1, PICALM, CR1, ABCA7 and TREM2 are the current genes of interest. In        addition, risk prediction for AD and research on other related diseases are also        popular research directions in this field. CONCLUSION: This study conducted a        comprehensive analysis of GWAS in AD and identified the current research hotspots        and research trends. In addition, we also pointed out the shortcomings of current        research and suggested future research directions.

Aging is one of the risk factors for AD. Although the mechanisms        underlying aging and the incidence rate of AD are unclear, aging and AD share        some hallmarks, such as oxidative stress and chronic inflammation. Cannabidiol        (CBD), the major non-psychoactive phytocannabinoid extracted from Cannabis        sativa, has recently emerged as a potential candidate for delaying aging and a        valuable therapeutic tool for the treatment of aging-related neurodegenerative        diseases due to its antioxidant and anti-inflammation properties. This article        reviews the relevant literature on AD, CBD treatment for AD, cellular senescence,        aging, and CBD treatment for aging in recent years. By analyzing these published        data, we attempt to explore the complex correlation between cellular senescence,        aging, and Alzheimer's disease, clarify the positive feedback effect between the        senescence of neurocytes and Alzheimer's disease, and summarize the role and        possible molecular mechanisms of CBD in preventing aging and treating AD.

Investigating neurotrophin        growth factors could offer significant contributions to understanding AD        progression and prospective therapeutic interventions. METHODS AND RESULTS: The        present investigation collected blood samples from 50 patients diagnosed with AD        and 50 healthy individuals serving as controls. The mRNA expression levels of        neurotrophin growth factors and their receptors were measured using quantitative        PCR. A Bayesian regression model was used in the research to assess the        relationship between gene expression levels and demographic characteristics such        as age and gender. The correlations between variables were analyzed using        Spearman correlation coefficients, and the diagnostic potential was assessed        using a Receiver Operating Characteristic curve. NTRK2, TrkA, TrkC, and BDNF        expression levels were found to be considerably lower (p-value < 0.05) in the        blood samples of AD patients compared to the control group. The expression of        BDNF exhibited the most substantial decrease in comparison to other neurotrophin        growth factors. Correlation analysis indicates a statistically significant        positive association between the genes. The ROC analysis showed that BDNF        exhibited the greatest Area Under the Curve (AUC) value of 0.76, accompanied by a        sensitivity of 70% and specificity of 66%. TrkC, TrkA, and NTRK2 demonstrated        considerable diagnostic potential in distinguishing between cases and controls.        CONCLUSION: The observed decrease in the expression levels of NTRK2, TrkA, TrkC,        and BDNF in AD patients, along with the identified associations between specific        genes and their diagnostic capacity, indicate that these expressions have the        potential to function as biomarkers for the diagnosis and treatment of AD.",4c8e894eb6b631e6dd732e812b2023f4c615ca66,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/4c8e894eb6b631e6dd732e812b2023f4c615ca66,38165481,,,False,Molecular biology reports,0403234

Using ABCA7 knockout human iPSC models generated with CRISPR/Cas9,        we investigated the impacts of ABCA7 deficiency on neuronal metabolism and        function. Lipidomics revealed that mitochondria-related phospholipids, such as        phosphatidylglycerol and cardiolipin were reduced in the ABCA7-deficient        iPSC-derived cortical organoids. Consistently, ABCA7 deficiency-induced        alterations of mitochondrial morphology accompanied by reduced ATP synthase        activity and exacerbated oxidative damage in the organoids. Furthermore,        ABCA7-deficient iPSC-derived neurons showed compromised mitochondrial respiration        and excess ROS generation, as well as enlarged mitochondrial morphology compared        to the isogenic controls. ABCA7 deficiency also decreased spontaneous synaptic        firing and network formation in iPSC-derived neurons, in which the effects were        rescued by supplementation with phosphatidylglycerol or NAD(+) precursor,        nicotinamide mononucleotide. Importantly, effects of ABCA7 deficiency on        mitochondria morphology and synapses were recapitulated in synaptosomes isolated        from the brain of neuron-specific Abca7 knockout mice.

The co-citation analysis of publications was visualized. In        addition, research hotspots and fronts were examined. RESULTS: A total of 1,350        publications with 59,818 citations were identified. The number of publications        and citations presented a significant rising trend since 2013. The United States        was the leading country with an overwhelming number of publications (775) and        citations (42,237).

We employed a multipronged approach to characterize the        transition from middle to old age in mice with APOE2 allele, using behavioral        assessments, image-derived morphometry and diffusion metrics, structural        connectomics, and blood transcriptomics. We used sparse multiple canonical        correlation analyses (SMCCA) for integrative modeling, and graph neural network        predictions. Our results revealed brain sub-networks associated with biological        traits, cognitive markers, and gene expression. The cingulate cortex emerged as a        critical region, demonstrating age-associated atrophy and diffusion changes, with        higher fractional anisotropy in males and middle-aged subjects. Somatosensory and        olfactory regions were consistently highlighted, indicating age-related atrophy        and sex differences. The hippocampus exhibited significant volumetric changes        with age, with differences between males and females in CA3 and CA1 regions.        SMCCA underscored changes in the cingulate cortex, somatosensory cortex,        olfactory regions, and hippocampus in relation to cognition and blood-based gene        expression.

SORL1 contributes to the development and progression of this        neurodegenerative condition by affecting the transport and metabolism of        intracellular β-amyloid precursor protein. To better understand the underlying        mechanisms of SORL1 in the pathogenesis of late-onset Alzheimer's disease, in        this study, we established a mouse model of Sorl1 gene knockout using clustered        regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats-associated protein 9 technology.        We found that Sorl1-knockout mice displayed deficits in learning and memory.        Furthermore, the expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor was        significantly downregulated in the hippocampus and cortex, and amyloid β-protein        deposits were observed in the brains of Sorl1-knockout mice. In vitro,        hippocampal neuronal cell synapses from homozygous Sorl1-knockout mice were        impaired. The expression of synaptic proteins, including Drebrin and NR2B, was        significantly reduced, and also their colocalization.

DISCUSSION: Unique AD-inflammatory        biomarker correlations in a community-based cohort reveal a new avenue for        utilizing plasma-based biomarkers in the assessment of AD and related dementias.        HIGHLIGHTS: Large community cohorts studying sex, age, and APOE genotype effects        on biomarkers are few. It is unknown how biomarker-biomarker associations vary        through aging and dementia. Six AD (Aβ40, Aβ42, Aβ42/40, p-tau181, total tau, and        NfLight) and five inflammatory biomarkers (TNFα, IL6, IL8, IL10, and GFAP) were        used to examine associations between biomarkers. Plasma biomarkers suggesting        increasing cerebral AD pathology corresponded to increases in peripheral        inflammatory markers, both pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory. Strength of        correlations, between pairs of classic AD and inflammatory plasma biomarker,        changes throughout cognitive progression to dementia.",70bf8b1e612411b3764594d38ecfceaf18dccc54,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/70bf8b1e612411b3764594d38ecfceaf18dccc54,38011580,PMC10917006,,False,Alzheimer's & dementia : the journal of the Alzheimer's Association,101231978

The most common forms are Alzheimer's disease, vascular        dementia, and other (frontotemporal, Lewy body disease) dementias. The etiology        of these multifactorial disorders involves complex interactions of various        environmental and (epi)genetic factors and requires multiple forms of        pharmacological intervention, including anti-dementia drugs for cognitive        impairment, antidepressants, antipsychotics, anxiolytics and sedatives for        behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia, and other drugs for comorbid        disorders. The pharmacotherapy of dementia patients has been characterized by a        significant interindividual variability in drug response and the development of        adverse drug effects. The therapeutic response to currently available drugs is        partially effective in only some individuals, with side effects, drug        interactions, intolerance, and non-compliance occurring in the majority of        dementia patients.

Although the exact mechanisms underlying AD        pathogenesis remain unclear, it is commonly accepted that the aggregation of        misfolded proteins, such as amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tau tangles,        plays a critical role. Additionally, AD is a multifactorial condition influenced        by various genetic factors and can manifest as either early-onset AD (EOAD) or        late-onset AD (LOAD), each associated with specific gene variants. One gene of        particular interest in both EOAD and LOAD is RIN3, a guanine nucleotide exchange        factor. This gene plays a multifaceted role in AD pathogenesis. Firstly,        upregulation of RIN3 can result in endosomal enlargement and dysfunction, thereby        facilitating the accumulation of beta-amyloid (Aβ) peptides in the brain.        Secondly, RIN3 has been shown to impact the PICLAM pathway, affecting        transcytosis across the blood-brain barrier. Lastly, RIN3 has implications for        immune-mediated responses, notably through its influence on the PTK2B gene.

Urine is more        convenient which could reflect the change of disease at an earlier stage. Thus,        we conducted a cross-sectional study to investigate novel diagnostic panels.        METHODS: We firstly enrolled participants from China-Japan Friendship Hospital        from April 2022 to November 2022, collected urine samples, and conducted an        LC-MS/MS analysis. In parallel, clinical data were collected, and clinical        examinations were performed. After statistical and bioinformatics analyses,        significant risk factors and differential urinary proteins were determined.

Specifically, several studies        have revealed the high expression of APP during brain development. Previous        studies in our laboratory revealed that a transient increase in APP expression        induces early cell cycle exit of human neural stem cells (hNSCs) and directs        their differentiation towards glial cells (gliogenesis) while decreasing their        differentiation towards neurons (neurogenesis). In the present study, we have        evaluated the intrinsic cellular effects of APP down-expression (using siRNA) on        cell death, cell proliferation, and cell fate specification of hNSCs. Our data        indicate that APP silencing causes cellular effects opposite to those obtained in        previous APP overexpression assays, inducing cell proliferation in hNS1 cells (a        model line of hNSCs) and favoring neurogenesis instead of gliogenesis in these        cells.

Surprisingly, two of these miRNAs (has-mir-4668-5p and        has-mir-5584-5p) exclusively interact with circPSEN1s rather than mRNA-PSEN1.        Furthermore, the analysis of pathways revealed that these two miRNAs        predominantly target mRNAs associated with the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway. With        sponging these microRNAs, circPSEN1s were found to protect mRNAs commonly        targeted by these miRNAs, including QSER1, BACE2, RNF157, PTMA, and GJD3.        Furthermore, the miRNAs sequestered by circPSEN1s have a notable preference for        targeting the TGF-β and Hippo signaling pathways. We also demonstrated that        circPSEN1s potentially interact with FOXA1, ESR1, HNF1B, BRD4, GATA4, EP300,        CBX3, PRDM9, and PPARG proteins. These proteins have a prominent preference for        targeting the TGF-β and Notch signaling pathways, where EP300 and FOXA1 have the        highest number of protein interactions. Molecular docking analysis also confirms        the interaction of these hub proteins and Aβ42 with circPSEN1s. Interestingly,        circPSEN1s-targeted molecules (miRNAs and proteins) impacted TGF-β, which served        as a shared signaling pathway. Finally, the analysis of microarray data unveiled        distinct expression patterns of genes influenced by circPSEN1s (WTIP, TGIF,        SMAD4, PPP1CB, and BMPR1A) in the brains of AD patients. In summary, our findings        suggested that the interaction of circPSEN1s with microRNAs and proteins could        affect the fate of specific mRNAs, interrupt the function of unique proteins, and        influence cell signaling pathways, generally TGF-β. Further research is necessary        to validate these findings and gain a deeper understanding of the precise        mechanisms and significance of circPSEN1s in the context of AD.",3654851b6058e3663f293f83136d727f113db124,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/3654851b6058e3663f293f83136d727f113db124,37759801,PMC10527059,background,False,Biomolecules,101596414

As most studies rely on mouse models, we investigated these genes and        proteins in the cortical brain tissue of older adults and their role in        Alzheimer's disease (AD) and related disorders. METHODS: We leveraged protein        measurements, single-nuclei, and RNASeq data from the Religious Orders Study and        Rush Memory and Aging Project (ROSMAP) of over 1200 samples for association        analysis.

10.1007/s00018-023-04939-w,Real-time heterogeneity of supramolecular assembly of amyloid precursor protein is modulated by an endocytic risk factor PICALM,2023.0,"Recently, the localization of amyloid precursor protein (APP) into reversible        nanoscale supramolecular assembly or ""nanodomains"" has been highlighted as        crucial towards understanding the onset of the molecular pathology of Alzheimer's        disease (AD). Surface expression of APP is regulated by proteins interacting with        it, controlling its retention and lateral trafficking on the synaptic membrane.        Here, we evaluated the involvement of a key risk factor for AD, PICALM, as a        critical regulator of nanoscale dynamics of APP. Although it was enriched in the        postsynaptic density, PICALM was also localized to the presynaptic active zone        and the endocytic zone. PICALM colocalized with APP and formed nanodomains with        distinct morphological properties in different subsynaptic regions. Next, we        evaluated if this localization to subsynaptic compartments was regulated by the        C-terminal sequences of APP, namely, the ""Y(682)ENPTY(687)"" domain. Towards this,        we found that deletion of C-terminal regions of APP with partial or complete        deletion of Y(682)ENPTY(687), namely, APP-Δ9 and APP-Δ14, affected the lateral        diffusion and nanoscale segregation of APP. Lateral diffusion of APP mutant        APP-Δ14 sequence mimicked that of a detrimental Swedish mutant of APP, namely,        APP-SWE, while APP-Δ9 diffused similar to wild-type APP. Interestingly, elevated        expression of PICALM differentially altered the lateral diffusion of the APP        C-terminal deletion mutants. These observations confirm that the C-terminal        sequence of APP regulates its lateral diffusion and the formation of reversible        nanoscale domains. Thus, when combined with autosomal dominant mutations, it        generates distinct molecular patterns leading to onset of Alzheimer's disease        (AD).",1295a7b28a022f65f69c123ce234cc47e3dddf1b,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/1295a7b28a022f65f69c123ce234cc47e3dddf1b,37726569,,background,False,Cellular and molecular life sciences : CMLS,9705402

Many studies investigating the effect of statins on        lowering cholesterol suggest that there may be a link between cholesterol levels        and AD pathology. Since cholesterol is one of the most abundant lipid molecules,        especially in brain tissue, it affects most membrane-related processes, including        the formation of the most dangerous form of amyloid β, Aβ42. The entire Aβ        production system, which includes the amyloid precursor protein (APP),        β-secretase, and the complex of γ-secretase, is highly dependent on membrane        cholesterol content. Moreover, cholesterol can affect amyloidogenesis in many        ways. Cholesterol influences the stability and activity of secretases, but also        dictates their partitioning into specific cellular compartments and        cholesterol-enriched lipid rafts, where the amyloidogenic machinery is        predominantly localized. The most complicated relationships have been found in        the interaction between cholesterol and APP, where cholesterol affects not only        APP localization but also the precise character of APP dimerization and APP        processing by γ-secretase, which is important for the production of Aβ of        different lengths.

In this study, we induced tau        aggregation in wild-derived mice by expressing MAPT. To investigate the effect of        genetic background on the action of tau aggregates, we performed RNA sequencing        with brains of C57BL/6J, CAST/EiJ, PWK/PhJ, and WSB/EiJ mice (n = 64) and        determined core transcriptional signature conserved in all genetic backgrounds        and signature unique to wild-derived backgrounds. By measuring tau seeding        activity using the cortex, we identified 19 key genes associated with tau seeding        and amyloid response. Interestingly, microglial pathways were strongly associated        with tau seeding activity in CAST/EiJ and PWK/PhJ backgrounds.

AD is characterized by        the presence of abnormal amyloid protein plaques and tau tangles in the brain.        The dominant hypothesis, termed the amyloid hypothesis, attributes AD development        to excessive cleavage and accumulation of amyloid precursor protein (APP),        leading to brain tissue atrophy. The amyloid hypothesis has greatly influenced AD        research and therapeutic endeavors. However, despite significant attention, a        complete understanding of amyloid and APP's roles in disease pathology,        progression, and cognitive impairment remains elusive.

Two pathological processes-aggregation of the amyloid-β (Aβ)        peptide into plaques and the microtubule protein tau into neurofibrillary tangles        (NFTs)-are hallmarks of the disease. However, other pathological brain processes        are thought to be key disease mediators of Aβ plaque and NFT pathology. How these        additional pathologies evolve over the course of the disease is currently        unknown. Here we show that proteomic measurements in autosomal dominant AD        cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) linked to brain protein coexpression can be used to        characterize the evolution of AD pathology over a timescale spanning six decades.        SMOC1 and SPON1 proteins associated with Aβ plaques were elevated in AD CSF        nearly 30 years before the onset of symptoms, followed by changes in synaptic        proteins, metabolic proteins, axonal proteins, inflammatory proteins and finally        decreases in neurosecretory proteins.

Here, we used a large-scale proteomics platform to examine        the association of 4877 plasma proteins with 25-year dementia risk in 10,981        middle-aged adults. We found 32 dementia-associated plasma proteins that were        involved in proteostasis, immunity, synaptic function, and extracellular matrix        organization. We then replicated the association between 15 of these proteins and        clinically relevant neurocognitive outcomes in two independent cohorts.

Circadian rhythms emerge in early life concurrent with neuroimmune        sculpting of brain circuits and wane late in life alongside increasing        immunosenescence and neurodegeneration. Importantly, circadian dysregulation can        alter immune function, which may contribute to susceptibility to        neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative diseases.

AD diagnosis        and treatment are challenging, but molecular biomarkers show diagnostic        potential. This study aimed to investigate AD biomarkers in the peripheral blood.        METHOD: Utilizing three microarray datasets, we systematically analyzed the        differences in expression and predictive value of mitophagy-related hub genes        (MRHGs) in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells of patients with AD to identify        potential diagnostic biomarkers. Subsequently, a protein-protein interaction        network was constructed to identify hub genes, and functional enrichment analyses        were performed. Using consistent clustering analysis, AD subtypes with        significant differences were determined. Finally, infiltration patterns of immune        cells in AD subtypes and the relationship between MRHGs and immune cells were        investigated by two algorithms, CIBERSORT and single-sample gene set enrichment        analysis (ssGSEA). RESULTS: Our study identified 53 AD- and mitophagy-related        differentially expressed genes and six MRHGs, which may be potential biomarkers        for diagnosing AD. Functional analysis revealed that six MRHGs significantly        affected biologically relevant functions and signaling pathways such as IL-4        Signaling Pathway, RUNX3 Regulates Notch Signaling Pathway, IL-1 and        Megakaryocytes in Obesity Pathway, and Overview of Leukocyteintrinsic Hippo        Pathway. Furthermore, CIBERSORT and ssGSEA algorithms were used for all AD        samples to analyze the abundance of infiltrating immune cells in the two disease        subtypes. The results showed that these subtypes were significantly related to        immune cell types such as activated mast cells, regulatory T cells, M0        macrophages, and neutrophils. Moreover, specific MRHGs were significantly        correlated with immune cell levels. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that MRHGs        may contribute to the development and prognosis of AD. The six identified MRHGs        could be used as valuable diagnostic biomarkers for further research on AD.

A decisive factor in the disease occurs when        neurofibrillary tangles (NFT) composed of microtubule associated protein tau        (MAPT) form in the entorhinal cortex and then spread throughout the brain.        METHODS: We therefore determined mRNA and circular RNA changes during AD        progression, comparing Braak NFT stages I-VI. Total RNA was isolated from human        brain (entorhinal and frontotemporal cortex). Poly(A)+ RNA was subjected to        Nanopore sequencing, and total RNA was analyzed by standard Illumina sequencing.        Circular RNAs were sequenced from RNase R treated and rRNA depleted total RNA.        The sequences were analyzed using different bioinformatic tools, and expression        constructs for circRNAs were analyzed in transfection experiments. RESULTS: We        detected 11,873 circRNAs of which 276 correlated with Braak NFT stages. Adenosine        to inosine RNA editing increased about threefold in circRNAs during AD        progression. Importantly, this correlation cannot be detected with mRNAs.        CircMAN2A1 expression correlated with AD progression and transfection experiments        indicated that RNA editing promoted its translation using start codons out of        frame with linear mRNAs, which generates novel proteins.

10.3390/biomedicines11051398,An Insight into Cellular and Molecular Mechanisms Underlying the Pathogenesis of Neurodegeneration in Alzheimer’s Disease,2023.0,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prominent neurodegenerative disorder in the        aging population. It is characterized by cognitive decline, gradual        neurodegeneration, and the development of amyloid-β (Aβ)-plaques and        neurofibrillary tangles, which constitute hyperphosphorylated tau. The early        stages of neurodegeneration in AD include the loss of neurons, followed by        synaptic impairment. Since the discovery of AD, substantial factual research has        surfaced that outlines the disease's causes, molecular mechanisms, and        prospective therapeutics, but a successful cure for the disease has not yet been        discovered. This may be attributed to the complicated pathogenesis of AD, the        absence of a well-defined molecular mechanism, and the constrained diagnostic        resources and treatment options. To address the aforementioned challenges,        extensive disease modeling is essential to fully comprehend the underlying        mechanisms of AD, making it easier to design and develop effective treatment        strategies. Emerging evidence over the past few decades supports the critical        role of Aβ and tau in AD pathogenesis and the participation of glial cells in        different molecular and cellular pathways. This review extensively discusses the        current understanding concerning Aβ- and tau-associated molecular mechanisms and        glial dysfunction in AD. Moreover, the critical risk factors associated with AD        including genetics, aging, environmental variables, lifestyle habits, medical        conditions, viral/bacterial infections, and psychiatric factors have been        summarized. The present study will entice researchers to more thoroughly        comprehend and explore the current status of the molecular mechanism of AD, which        may assist in AD drug development in the forthcoming era.",f7a26d7e8658da1debf7e0feb9df7290243e796d,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/f7a26d7e8658da1debf7e0feb9df7290243e796d,37239068,PMC10216658,background,False,Biomedicines,101691304

Being a lysosomal 5'-3' exonuclease, its neuronal substrates        remained unknown as well as how a defective lysosomal nucleotide catabolism        connects to AD-proteinopathy. We identified mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) as a major        physiological substrate and show its manifest build-up in lysosomes of        PLD3-defective cells. mtDNA accretion creates a degradative (proteolytic)        bottleneck that presents at the ultrastructural level as a marked abundance of        multilamellar bodies, often containing mitochondrial remnants, which correlates        with increased PINK1-dependent mitophagy. Lysosomal leakage of mtDNA to the        cytosol activates cGAS-STING signaling that upregulates autophagy and induces        amyloid precursor C-terminal fragment (APP-CTF) and cholesterol accumulation.        STING inhibition largely normalizes APP-CTF levels, whereas an APP knockout in        PLD3-deficient backgrounds lowers STING activation and normalizes cholesterol        biosynthesis. Collectively, we demonstrate molecular cross-talks through        feedforward loops between lysosomal nucleotide turnover, cGAS-STING and APP        metabolism that, when dysregulated, result in neuronal endolysosomal demise as        observed in LOAD.",be043c209726b32efdd60fc048776e163251766d,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/be043c209726b32efdd60fc048776e163251766d,37225734,PMC10209153,,False,Nature communications,101528555

Genome-wide association studies have        uncovered genetic variants associated with specific neurological phenotypes and        diseases. In addition, single-cell transcriptomics have provided molecular        descriptions of specific brain cell types and the changes they undergo during        disease. Although these approaches provide a giant leap forward towards        understanding how genetic variation can lead to functional changes in the brain,        they do not establish molecular mechanisms. To address this need, we developed a        3D co-culture system termed iAssembloids (induced multi-lineage assembloids) that        enables the rapid generation of homogenous neuron-glia spheroids.

A steep rise in AD        incidents is observed in the elderly population in East-Asian countries. The        disease progresses through several changes, including memory loss, behavioural        issues, and cognitive impairment. The etiology of AD is hard to determine because        of its complex nature. The whole exome sequences of late-onset AD (LOAD) patients        of Korean origin are investigated to identify rare genetic variants that may        influence the complex disorder.

CAA is associated with magnetic        resonance imaging (MRI) markers of small vessel disease (SVD). Since Aβ is also        accumulated in Alzheimer's disease (AD) in the brain parenchyma, we aimed to        study if several single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) previously associated        with AD were also associated with CAA pathology. Furthermore, we also studied the        influence of APOE and CLU genetic variants in apolipoprotein E (ApoE) and        clusterin/apolipoprotein J (ApoJ) circulating levels and their distribution among        lipoproteins. METHODS: The study was carried out in a multicentric cohort of 126        patients with lobar ICH and clinical suspicion of CAA. RESULTS: We observed        several SNPs associated with CAA neuroimaging MRI markers [cortical superficial        siderosis (cSS), enlarged perivascular spaces in the centrum semiovale        (CSO-EPVS), lobar cerebral microbleeds (CMB), white matter hyperintensities        (WMH), corticosubcortical atrophy and CAA-SVD burden score]. Concretely, ABCA7        (rs3764650), CLU (rs9331896 and rs933188), EPHA1 (rs11767557), and TREML2        (rs3747742) were significantly associated with a CAA-SVD burden score. Regarding        circulating levels of apolipoproteins, protective AD SNPs of CLU [rs11136000 (T)        and rs9331896 (C)] were significantly associated with higher HDL ApoJ content in        the lobar ICH cohort. APOEε2 carriers presented higher plasma and LDL-associated        ApoE levels whereas APOEε4 carriers presented lower plasma ApoE levels.        Additionally, we observed that lower circulating ApoJ and ApoE levels were        significantly associated with CAA-related MRI markers. More specifically, lower        LDL-associated ApoJ and plasma and HDL-associated ApoE levels were significantly        associated with CSO-EPVS, lower ApoJ content in HDL with brain atrophy and lower        ApoE content in LDL with the extent of cSS. DISCUSSION: This study reinforces the        relevance of lipid metabolism in CAA and cerebrovascular functionality. We        propose that ApoJ and ApoE distribution among lipoproteins may be associated with        pathological features related to CAA with higher ApoE and ApoJ levels in HDL        possibly enhancing atheroprotective, antioxidative, and anti-inflammatory        responses in cerebral β-amyloidosis.",120a7f64cc6a34504272f2c1378d3973bbb304f0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/120a7f64cc6a34504272f2c1378d3973bbb304f0,37113571,PMC10126235,background,False,Frontiers in aging neuroscience,101525824

The        success of MABs reflects a relentless application of neuroscience knowledge to        solving major challenges facing humankind. The success of these transformative        agents will foster the development of more anti-amyloid MABs, other types of        anti-amyloid therapies, treatments of other targets of AD biology, and new        approaches to therapies for an array of neurodegenerative disorders. Monoclonal        antibodies have side effects and, during the period of treatment initiation,        patients must be closely monitored for the occurrence of amyloid-related imaging        abnormalities (ARIA) and infusion reactions. A successful first step in the        development of disease-modifying therapy for AD defines desirable features for        the next phase of therapeutic development including less frequent ARIA, more        convenient administration, and greater efficacy. Unprecedented agents make new        demands on patients and care partners, clinicians, payers, and health care        systems. Collaboration among stakeholders is essential to take advantage of the        therapeutic benefits offered by these agents and to make them widely available.        Monoclonal antibodies usher in a new era in AD therapy and define a new landscape        of what is possible for therapeutic development for neurodegenerative disorders.",a9ef31c482a1d488e976b34e3c9c0eae625b4151,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/a9ef31c482a1d488e976b34e3c9c0eae625b4151,37060386,PMC10195708,,False,Drugs,7600076

While advances in transcriptomic profiling of        microglia from the CNS of humans and animal models have provided transformative        insights, the transcriptome is only modestly reflective of the proteome.        Proteomic profiling of microglia is therefore more likely to provide functionally        and therapeutically relevant targets.

In this review, we first provide an overview of those        aspects of AD that are largely stereotyped and those that are heterogeneous, and        we review the evidence supporting the concept that different subtypes of AD are        important to consider in the design of agents for the prevention and treatment of        the disease.

Worldwide, 50 million people have the disease, and it        is estimated that there will be 150 million by 2050. Today, healthcare for AD        patients consumes 1% of the global economy. According to the amyloid cascade        hypothesis, AD begins in the brain by accumulating and aggregating Aβ peptides        and forming β-amyloid fibrils (Aβ42). However, in clinical trials, reducing Aβ        peptide production and amyloid formation in the brain did not slow cognitive        decline or improve daily life in AD patients. Prevention studies in cognitively        unimpaired people at high risk or genetically destined to develop AD also have        not slowed cognitive decline. These observations argue against the amyloid        hypothesis of AD etiology, its development, and disease mechanisms.

10.1111/cns.14160,Insulin‐like growth factor‐2 is a promising candidate for the treatment and prevention of Alzheimer's disease,2023.0,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia. Current AD        treatments slow the rate of cognitive decline, but do not restore lost function.        One reason for the low efficacy of current treatments is that they fail to target        neurotrophic processes, which are thought to be essential for functional        recovery. Bolstering neurotrophic processes may also be a viable strategy for        preventative treatment, since structural losses are thought to underlie cognitive        decline in AD. The challenge of identifying presymptomatic patients who might        benefit from preventative treatment means that any such treatment must meet a        high standard of safety and tolerability. The neurotrophic peptide insulin-like        growth factor-2 (IGF2) is a promising candidate for both treating and preventing        AD-induced cognitive decline. Brain IGF2 expression declines in AD patients. In        rodent models of AD, exogenous IGF2 modulates multiple aspects of AD pathology,        resulting in (1) improved cognitive function; (2) stimulation of neurogenesis and        synaptogenesis; and, (3) neuroprotection against cholinergic dysfunction and beta        amyloid-induced neurotoxicity. Preclinical evidence suggests that IGF2 is likely        to be safe and tolerable at therapeutic doses. In the preventative treatment        context, the intranasal route of administration is likely to be the preferred        method for achieving the therapeutic effect without risking adverse side effects.        For patients already experiencing AD dementia, routes of administration that        deliver IGF2 directly access the CNS may be necessary.

Metabolically, astrocytes possess low        mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos) activity, but its        pathophysiological role in neurodegeneration remains unclear. Here, we show that        the brain critically depends on astrocytic OxPhos to degrade fatty acids (FAs)        and maintain lipid homeostasis. Aberrant astrocytic OxPhos induces lipid droplet        (LD) accumulation followed by neurodegeneration that recapitulates key features        of Alzheimer's disease (AD), including synaptic loss, neuroinflammation,        demyelination and cognitive impairment.

These evolutionally conserved guidance cues        and their receptors regulate multiple aspects of neural development to establish        the highly complex nervous system by mediating both short- and long-range        cell-cell communications. Neuronal guidance genes (encoding cues, receptors, or        downstream signal transducers) are critical not only for development of the        nervous system but also for synaptic maintenance, remodeling, and function in the        adult brain. One emerging theme is the combinatorial and complementary functions        of relatively limited classes of neuronal guidance genes in multiple processes,        including neuronal migration, axonal guidance, synaptogenesis, and circuit        formation.

However, it is not known if this effect of β-glucan is        involved in AD. METHOD: This study used behavioral testing to measure cognitive        function. After that, high-throughput 16 S rRNA gene sequencing and GC-MS were        used to analyze the intestinal microbiota and metabolite SCFAs of AD model mice,        and further explore the relationship between intestinal flora and        neuroinflammation. Finally, the expressions of inflammatory factors in the mouse        brain were detected by Western blot and Elisa methods. RESULTS: We found that        appropriate supplementation of β-glucan during the progression of AD can improve        cognitive impairment and reduce A β plaque deposition. In addition,        supplementation of β-glucan can also promote changes in the composition of the        intestinal flora, thereby changing the flora metabolites in the intestinal        content and reduce the activation of inflammatory factors and microglia in the        cerebral cortex and hippocampus through the brain-gut axis.

10.1186/s13073-023-01160-z,TREM2 splice isoforms generate soluble TREM2 species that disrupt long-term potentiation,2023.0,"BACKGROUND: TREM2 is a transmembrane receptor expressed by myeloid cells and acts        to regulate their immune response. TREM2 governs the response of microglia to        amyloid and tau pathologies in the Alzheimer's disease (AD) brain. TREM2 is also        present in a soluble form (sTREM2), and its CSF levels fluctuate as a function of        AD progression. Analysis of stroke and AD mouse models revealed that sTREM2        proteins bind to neurons, which suggests sTREM2 may act in a non-cell autonomous        manner to influence neuronal function. sTREM2 arises from the proteolytic        cleavage of the membrane-associated receptor. However, alternatively spliced        TREM2 species lacking a transmembrane domain have been postulated to contribute        to the pool of sTREM2. Thus, both the source of sTREM2 species and its actions in        the brain remain unclear. METHODS: The expression of TREM2 isoforms in the AD        brain was assessed through the analysis of the Accelerating Medicines Partnership        for Alzheimer's Disease Consortium transcriptomics data, as well as qPCR analysis        using post-mortem samples of AD patients and of the AD mouse model 5xFAD. TREM2        cleavage and secretion were studied in vitro using HEK-293T and HMC3 cell lines.        Synaptic plasticity, as evaluated by induction of LTP in hippocampal brain        slices, was employed as a measure of sTREM2 actions. RESULTS: Three distinct        TREM2 transcripts, namely ENST00000373113 (TREM2(230)), which encodes the        full-length transmembrane receptor, and the alternatively spliced isoforms        ENST00000373122 (TREM2(222)) and ENST00000338469 (TREM2(219)), are moderately        increased in specific brain regions of patients with AD. We provide experimental        evidence that TREM2 alternatively spliced isoforms are translated and secreted as        sTREM2. Furthermore, our functional analysis reveals that all sTREM2 species        inhibit LTP induction, and this effect is abolished by the GABAA receptor        antagonist picrotoxin. CONCLUSIONS: TREM2 transcripts can give rise to a        heterogeneous pool of sTREM2 which acts to inhibit LTP. These results provide        novel insight into the generation, regulation, and function of sTREM2 which fits        into the complex biology of TREM2 and its role in human health and disease. Given        that sTREM2 levels are linked to AD pathogenesis and progression, our finding        that sTREM2 species interfere with LTP furthers our understanding about the role        of TREM2 in AD.",6fc4c4c535b102de9d20c9b1c0ee73a6197e7487,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/6fc4c4c535b102de9d20c9b1c0ee73a6197e7487,36805764,PMC9940368,background,False,Genome medicine,101475844

Compared        with an overall polygenic risk score (PRS), a pathway-specific PRS (p-PRS) may be        more appropriate in predicting a specific biomarker or cognitive component        underlying LOAD pathology earlier in the lifespan. OBJECTIVE: In this study, we        leveraged 10 years of longitudinal data from initially cognitively unimpaired        individuals in the Wisconsin Registry for Alzheimer's Prevention and explored        changing patterns in cognition and biomarkers at various age points along six        biological pathways. METHODS: PRS and p-PRSs with and without apolipoprotein E (        APOE ) were constructed separately based on the significant SNPs associated with        LOAD in a recent genome-wide association study meta-analysis and compared to APOE        alone. We used a linear mixed-effects model to assess the association between        PRS/p-PRSs and global/domain-specific cognitive trajectories among 1,175        individuals. We also applied the model to the outcomes of cerebrospinal fluid        biomarkers for beta-amyloid 42 (Aβ42), Aβ42/40 ratio, total tau, and        phosphorylated tau in a subset. Replication analyses were performed in an        independent sample. RESULTS: We found p-PRSs and the overall PRS can predict        preclinical changes in cognition and biomarkers. The effects of p-PRSs/PRS on        rate of change in cognition, beta-amyloid, and tau outcomes are dependent on age        and appear earlier in the lifespan when APOE is included in these risk scores        compared to when APOE is excluded. CONCLUSION: In addition to APOE , the p-PRSs        can predict age-dependent changes in beta-amyloid, tau, and cognition. Once        validated, they could be used to identify individuals with an elevated genetic        risk of accumulating beta-amyloid and tau, long before the onset of clinical        symptoms.",5b762ba8ac81d0dd125fe3beee53524e03c5013a,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/5b762ba8ac81d0dd125fe3beee53524e03c5013a,36778431,PMC9915839,background,False,medRxiv : the preprint server for health sciences,101767986

Increasing research evidence demonstrates that genetics may be a key        factor responsible for the occurrence of the disease. Although previous reports        identified quite a few AD-associated genes, they were mostly limited owing to        patient sample size and selection bias. There is a lack of comprehensive research        aimed to identify AD-associated risk mutations systematically. To address this        challenge, we hereby construct a large-scale AD mutation and co-mutation        framework ('AD-Syn-Net'), and propose deep learning models named Deep-SMCI and        Deep-CMCI configured with fully connected layers that are capable of predicting        cognitive impairment of subjects effectively based on genetic mutation and        co-mutation profiles. Next, we apply the customized frameworks to data sets to        evaluate the importance scores of the mutations and identified mutation effectors        and co-mutation combination vulnerabilities contributing to cognitive impairment.        Furthermore, we evaluate the influence of mutation pairs on the network        architecture to dissect the genetic organization of AD and identify novel        co-mutations that could be responsible for dementia, laying a solid foundation        for proposing future targeted therapy for AD precision medicine.

Here, we developed a        next-generation bioinformatics algorithm and application, PolyAMiner-Bulk, that        utilizes an attention-based machine learning architecture and an improved vector        projection-based engine to infer differential APA dynamics accurately. When        applied to earlier studies, PolyAMiner-Bulk accurately identified more than twice        the number of APA changes in an RBM17 knockdown bulk RNA-seq dataset compared to        current generation tools. Moreover, on a separate dataset, PolyAMiner-Bulk        revealed novel APA dynamics and pathways in scleroderma pathology and identified        differential APA in a gene that was identified as being involved in scleroderma        pathogenesis in an independent study.

Exploring the genetic basis        is essential for understanding the pathogenic mechanisms underlying AD        development. Recent genome-wide association studies (GWASs) reported an        AD-associated signal in the Cathepsin H (CTSH) gene in European populations.        However, the exact functional/causal variant(s), and the genetic regulating        mechanism of CTSH in AD remain to be determined. In this study, we carried out a        comprehensive study to characterize the role of CTSH variants in the pathogenesis        of AD. We identified rs2289702 in CTSH as the most significant functional variant        that is associated with a protective effect against AD. The genetic association        between rs2289702 and AD was validated in independent cohorts of the Han Chinese        population.

Long        non-coding RNA (lncRNA) is highly expressed in the brain and plays important        roles in central nervous system diseases like Alzheimer's disease. In the present        work, we found that the expression of lnc240 in the hippocampus of HE mice was        significantly downregulated, but its pathogenesis in HE has not been clarified.        This study aimed to explore the effects of lnc240 on the cognitive function of        HE. The expression of lnc240, miR-1264-5p, and MEF2C was analyzed with RNA-seq        and further determined by qRT-PCR in HE mouse. Double luciferase reporter gene        testing confirmed the relationship between lnc240, MEF2C, and miR-1264-5p. The        functional role of lnc240 and MEF2C in vitro and in vivo was evaluated by        qRT-PCR, western blot analysis, immunofluorescence staining, Golgi staining,        electrophysiology, and Morris water maze. The expression of lnc240 was decreased        in HE mice. The overexpression of lnc240 could significantly downregulate        miR-1264-5p and upregulate MEF2C, also increasing the amplitude and frequency of        mEPSC in primary cultured hippocampal neurons. The overexpression of miR-1264-5p        reversed the effect of lnc240 on MEF2C. Moreover, in vivo experiments have shown        that the overexpression of lnc240 could improve HE mice's spatial learning and        memory functions. Golgi staining suggested that overexpression of lnc240 could        increase the density and maturity of dendritic spines in hippocampal neurons of        HE mice. Lnc240 can regulate the expression of MEF2C through miR-1264-5p and        regulate the synaptic plasticity of hippocampal neurons, thereby saving the        learning and memory dysfunction in HE mice, suggesting that lnc240 might be a        potential therapeutic target for the treatment of HE.",0f996423e8d1d57e38992986c54f87eb8d480cc1,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0f996423e8d1d57e38992986c54f87eb8d480cc1,36645630,,,False,Molecular neurobiology,8900963

Microglia-mediated synaptic elimination plays an        indispensable role in sleep deprivation. Here, the potential role of the        CD33/TREM2 signaling pathway in modulating memory decline during chronic sleep        restriction (CSR) was evaluated. In this study, adult male C57BL/6 mice were        sleep-restricted using an automated sleep deprivation apparatus for 20 h per day        for 7 days. The Y-maze test revealed that spontaneous alternation was        significantly reduced in CSR mice compared with control mice. The percentage of        exploratory preference for the novel object in CSR mice was significantly        decreased compared with that in control mice. These memory deficits correlated        with aberrant microglial activation and increased phagocytic ability. Moreover,        in CSR mice, the CD33 protein level in hippocampal tissue was significantly        downregulated, but the TREM2 protein level was increased. In BV2 microglial        cells, downregulation of CD33 increased TREM2 expression and improved microglial        phagocytosis. Then, the sialic ligand monosialo-ganglioside 1 (GM1, 20 mg/kg,        i.p.) was administered to mice once a day during CSR. Our results further showed        that GM1 activated CD33 and consequently disturbed TREM2-mediated microglial        phagocytosis. Finally, GM1 reversed CSR-induced synaptic loss and memory        impairment via the CD33/TREM2 signaling pathway in the CA1 region of the        hippocampus.

METHODS: Cognitively        healthy older adults (n = 48) were tested on four visuomotor tasks where reach        and gaze were increasingly spatially dissociated. Participants who had a family        history of dementia or the APOE ε4 allele were considered to be at an increased        risk for AD. To quantify RSFC within networks of interest, an EPI sequence        sensitive to BOLD contrast was collected. The networks of interest were the        default mode network (DMN), somatomotor network (SMN), dorsal attention network        (DAN), ventral attention network (VAN), and frontoparietal control network (FPN).        RESULTS: Individuals with the ε4 allele showed abnormalities in RSFC between        posterior DMN nodes that predicted poorer non-standard visuomotor performance.        Specifically, multiple linear regression analyses revealed lower RSFC between the        precuneus/posterior cingulate cortex and the left inferior parietal lobule as        well as the left parahippocampal cortex. Presence of the APOE ε4 allele also        modified the relationship between mean DAN RSFC and visuomotor control, where        lower mean RSFC in the DAN predicted worse non-standard visuomotor performance        only in APOE ε4 carriers. There were otherwise no effects of family history, APOE        ε4 status, or sex on the relationship between RSFC and visuomotor performance for        any of the other resting networks. CONCLUSION: The preliminary findings provide        insight into the impact of APOE ε4-related genetic risk on neural networks        underlying complex visuomotor transformations, and demonstrate that the        non-standard visuomotor task paradigm discussed in this study may be used as a        non-invasive, easily accessible assessment tool for dementia risk.",e2f842ba8dbb760c80a600f83561360ec8d1b604,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/e2f842ba8dbb760c80a600f83561360ec8d1b604,36533177,PMC9751763,methodology,False,Frontiers in aging neuroscience,101525824

Hippocampal dysfunction in MS and EAE causes        varying degrees of cognitive and emotional impairments and synaptic        abnormalities. However, the molecular alterations underlying hippocampal        dysfunctions in MS and EAE are still under investigation. The purpose of this        study was to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the hippocampus of        mice with EAE in order to ascertain potential genes associated with hippocampal        dysfunction. Gene expression in the hippocampus was analyzed by RNA-sequencing        and validated by reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction        (RT-qPCR). Gene expression analysis revealed 1202 DEGs; 1023 were upregulated and        179 were downregulated in the hippocampus of mice with EAE (p-value < 0.05 and        fold change >1.5). Gene ontology (GO) analysis showed that the upregulated genes        in the hippocampi of mice with EAE were associated with immune system processes,        defense responses, immune responses, and regulation of immune responses, whereas        the downregulated genes were related to learning or memory, behavior, and nervous        system processes in the GO biological process. The expressions of hub genes from        the search tool for the retrieval of interacting genes/proteins (STRING) analysis        were validated by RT-qPCR. Additionally, gene set enrichment analysis showed that        the upregulated genes in the hippocampus were associated with inflammatory        responses: interferon-γ responses, allograft rejection, interferon-α responses,        IL6_JAK_STAT3 signaling, inflammatory responses, complement, IL2_STAT5 signaling,        TNF-α signaling via NF-κB, and apoptosis, whereas the downregulated genes were        related to synaptic plasticity, dendritic development, and development of        dendritic spine. This study characterized the transcriptome pattern in the        hippocampi of mice with EAE and signaling pathways underpinning hippocampal        dysfunction. However, further investigation is needed to determine the        applicability of these findings from this rodent model to patients with MS.        Collectively, these results indicate directions for further research to        understand the mechanisms behind hippocampal dysfunction in EAE.",3acbf67d00a6252e20070a2163d604cc768c6596,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/3acbf67d00a6252e20070a2163d604cc768c6596,36499161,PMC9738199,background,False,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791

10.3390/ijms232213954,Alzheimer’s Disease: Treatment Strategies and Their Limitations,2022.0,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most frequent case of neurodegenerative disease        and is becoming a major public health problem all over the world. Many        therapeutic strategies have been explored for several decades; however, there is        still no curative treatment, and the priority remains prevention. In this review,        we present an update on the clinical and physiological phase of the AD spectrum,        modifiable and non-modifiable risk factors for AD treatment with a focus on        prevention strategies, then research models used in AD, followed by a discussion        of treatment limitations. The prevention methods can significantly slow AD        evolution and are currently the best strategy possible before the advanced stages        of the disease. Indeed, current drug treatments have only symptomatic effects,        and disease-modifying treatments are not yet available. Drug delivery to the        central nervous system remains a complex process and represents a challenge for        developing therapeutic and preventive strategies. Studies are underway to test        new techniques to facilitate the bioavailability of molecules to the brain. After        a deep study of the literature, we find the use of soft nanoparticles, in        particular nanoliposomes and exosomes, as an innovative approach for preventive        and therapeutic strategies in reducing the risk of AD and solving problems of        brain bioavailability. Studies show the promising role of nanoliposomes and        exosomes as smart drug delivery systems able to penetrate the blood-brain barrier        and target brain tissues. Finally, the different drug administration techniques        for neurological disorders are discussed. One of the promising therapeutic        methods is the intranasal administration strategy which should be used for        preclinical and clinical studies of neurodegenerative diseases.",9dbe6b562aec1dc05309ecc0b7a89b81e6fd01bf,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/9dbe6b562aec1dc05309ecc0b7a89b81e6fd01bf,36430432,PMC9697769,,False,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791

We investigated several        single-nucleotide polymorphisms that were initially associated with suicide risk        in dementia older adults and identified the APOE gene alleles. The study was        performed with subjects over the age of 65: 112 patients with dementia and 146        healthy volunteers. The MMSE score was used to assess cognitive functions.

This study aimed to evaluate the effect of epistasis of gene        cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-α, IL-6, tumor necrosis factor (TNFα), and        interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) on the susceptibility to the development of dementia.        MATERIALS AND METHODS: In the study, 221 patients diagnosed with dementia and 710        controls were included. The multifactor-dimensionality reduction (MDR) analysis        was performed to identify the epistasis between SNP located in genes of IL-α        (rs1800587), IL-6 (rs1800796), TNFα (rs361525 and rs1800629), and IFNγ        (rs2069705).

In this study, we examined and validated a model using blood-based        biomarkers to predict the level of glial activation due to neuroinflammation, as        estimated by (11)C-DPA-713 positron emission tomography (PET) imaging. METHODS:        We included 15 patients with AD and 10 cognitively normal (CN) subjects. Stepwise        backward deletion multiple regression analysis was used to determine the        predictors of the TSPO-binding potential (BP(ND)) estimated by PET imaging. The        independent variables were age, sex, diagnosis, apolipoprotein E4 positivity,        body mass index and the serum concentration of blood-based biomarkers, including        monocyte chemotactic protein 1 (MCP-1), fractalkine, chitinase 3-like protein-1        (CHI3L1), soluble triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (sTREM2), and        clusterin. RESULTS: Sex, diagnosis, and serum concentrations of MCP1 and sTREM2        were determined as predictors of TSPO-BP(ND) in the Braak1-3 area. The serum        concentrations of MCP1 and sTREM2 correlated positively with TSPO-BP(ND). In a        leave one out (LOO) cross-validation (CV) analysis, the model gave a LOO CV R(2)        of 0.424, which indicated that this model can account for approximately 42.4% of        the variance of brain TSPO-BP(ND.) CONCLUSIONS: We found that the model including        serum MCP-1 and sTREM2 concentration and covariates of sex and diagnosis was the        best for predicting brain TSPO-BP(ND).

We        investigated the relationship between APOE ε4 carrier status, regional amyloid-β        (Aβ), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) volumetrics, tau positron emission        tomography (PET), APOE messenger RNA (mRNA) expression maps, and cerebrospinal        fluid phosphorylated tau (CSF ptau(181)). Three hundred fifty participants        underwent imaging, and 270 had ptau(181). We used computational models to        evaluate the main effect of APOE ε4 carrier status on regional neuroimaging        values and then the interaction of ε4 status and global Aβ on regional tau PET        and brain volumes as well as CSF ptau(181). Separately, we also examined the        additional interactive influence of sex. We found that, for the same degree of Aβ        burden, APOE ε4 carriers showed greater tau PET signal relative to noncarriers in        temporal regions, but no interaction was present for MRI volumes or CSF        ptau(181). This potentiation of tau aggregation irrespective of sex occurred in        brain regions with high APOE mRNA expression, suggesting local vulnerabilities to        tauopathy.

10.3390/ijms232113331,PSEN2 Thr421Met Mutation in a Patient with Early Onset Alzheimer’s Disease,2022.0,"Presenilin-2 (PSEN2) mutation Thr421Met was identified from a 57-years old        patient with early onset Alzheimer's disease (EOAD) for the first time in Korea.        Previously, this mutation was discovered in an EOAD patient in Japan without a        change on amyloid production from the cellular study. Both Korean and Japanese        patients developed the disease in their 50s. Memory loss was prominent in both        cases, but no additional clinical information was available on the Japanese        patient. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) images of the Korean patient revealed        asymmetric atrophies in both temporo-parietal lobes. In addition, amyloid        positron emission tomography (PET) also revealed amyloid deposits in the gray        matter of the temporo-parietal lobes asymmetrically. PSEN2 Thr421 was conserved        among a majority of vertebrates (such as zebras, elephants, and giant pandas);        hence, Thr421 could play an important role in its functions and any mutations        could cause detrimental ramifications in its interactions. Interestingly, PSEN2        Thr421 could have homology with PSEN1 Thr440, as PSEN1 T440del mutations were        reported from patients with AD or dementia with Lewy bodies. Hence, the changed        amino acid from threonine to methionine of PSEN2 Thr421 could cause significant        structural alterations in causing local protein dynamics, leading to its        pathogenicity in EOAD. Lastly, PSEN2 Thr421Met may interact with other mutations        in neurodegenerative disease related genes, which were found in the proband        patient, such as ATP binding cassette subfamily A member 7 (ABCA7), Notch        Receptor 3 (NOTCH3), or Leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2). These interactions        of pathway networks among PSEN2 and other disease risk factors could be        responsible for the disease phenotype through other pathways. For example, PSEN2        and ABCA7 may impact amyloid processing and reduce amyloid clearance. Interaction        between PSEN2 and NOTCH3 variants may be associated with abnormal NOTCH signaling        and a lower degree of neuroprotection. Along with LRRK2 variants, PSEN2 Thr421Met        may impact neurodegeneration through Wnt related pathways. In the future,        cellular studies of more than one mutation by CRISPR-Cas9 method along with        biomarker profiles could be helpful to understand the complicated pathways.",eac8564ebe943af480f7aafeee9e3239baab01b2,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/eac8564ebe943af480f7aafeee9e3239baab01b2,36362122,PMC9656741,background,False,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791

Our previous studies showed        HFD could moderate neuroinflammation and had no significant effect on amyloid-β        levels or contextual memory on AD mice. To gain more insights into the        involvement of HFD, we performed the whole-transcriptome sequencing and ribosome        footprints profiling. Combined with competitive endogenous RNA analysis, the        transcriptional regulation mechanism of HFD on AD mice was systematically        revealed from RNA level. Mmu-miR-450b-3p and mmu-miR-6540-3p might be involved in        regulating the expression of Th and Ddc expression. MiR-551b-5p regulated the        expression of a variety of genes including Slc18a2 and Igfbp3. The upregulation        of Pcsk9 expression in HFD intervention on AD mice might be closely related to        the increase of cholesterol in brain tissues, while Huanglian Jiedu Decoction        significantly downregulated the expression of Pcsk9. Our data showed the close        connection between the alterations of transcriptome and translatome under the        effect of HFD, which emphasized the roles of translational and transcriptional        regulation were relatively independent.

At present, there is no effective        disease-modifying treatment for AD. Here, we evaluated the therapeutic potential        of FDA-approved native poly(d,l-lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) nanoparticles on Aβ        aggregation and in cellular/animal models of AD. Our results showed that native        PLGA can not only suppress the spontaneous aggregation but can also trigger        disassembly of preformed Aβ aggregates. Spectroscopic studies, molecular dynamics        simulations and biochemical analyses revealed that PLGA, by interacting with the        hydrophobic domain of Aβ(1-42), prevents a conformational shift towards the        β-sheet structure, thus precluding the formation and/or triggering disassembly of        Aβ aggregates. PLGA-treated Aβ samples can enhance neuronal viability by reducing        phosphorylation of tau protein and its associated signaling mechanisms.        Administration of PLGA can interact with Aβ aggregates and attenuate memory        deficits as well as Aβ levels/deposits in the 5xFAD mouse model of AD. PLGA can        also protect iPSC-derived neurons from AD patients against Aβ toxicity by        decreasing tau phosphorylation.

RESULTS: We identified 133 unique and shared        metabolites associated with ADAD, TREM2, and sAD. We identified a signature of 16        metabolites significantly altered between groups and associated with AD duration.        DISCUSSION: AD genetic variants show distinct metabolic perturbations.        Investigation of these metabolites may provide greater insight into the etiology        of AD and its impact on clinical presentation. HIGHLIGHTS: APP/PSEN1/PSEN2 and        TREM2 variant carriers show distinct metabolic changes. A total of 133        metabolites were differentially abundant in AD genetic groups. β-citrylglutamate        is differentially abundant in autosomal dominant, TREM2, and sporadic AD. A        16-metabolite profile shows differences between Alzheimer's disease (AD) genetic        groups.

The current        study aimed to systematically explore the bidirectional relationship between        peripheral CD33 and AD. Genome-wide association study (GWAS) datasets of AD        (N(cases): 21982; N(controls): 41944), blood CD33 mRNA level, the plasma CD33        protein level, and CD33 expression on immune-cell subtypes were obtained from        GWASs conducted in the European population. Eligible IVs were extracted from the        GWASs. MR estimates were calculated by inverse-variance weighting (IVW) and other        sensitivity analyses. The main statistical analyses were conducted using        TwoSampleMR (v.0.5.5) in R package (V.4.1.2).In the forward MR analysis (CD33 as        exposure and AD as outcome), the IVW results indicated that elevated blood CD33        mRNA level (OR [95% CI] = 1.156[1.080, 1.238], p = 3.25e-05), elevated serum CD33        protein level (OR [95% CI] = 1.08 [1.031, 1.139], p = 1.6e-03) and increased        CD33's expression on immune cell subtypes (p < 0.05) were all leading to a higher        risk of AD. And sensitivity analyses supported these findings. While the reverse        MR analysis (AD as exposure and CD33 as outcome) indicated that AD was not        leading to the elevation of CD33's protein level in the blood (p > 0.05). In        conclusion, our results indicated that elevated peripheral expression of CD33 was        causal to the development of AD.

However,        there are few reported genetic profiles of FLOAD to date. In the present study,        targeted sequencing of selected candidate genes was conducted for each of 90        probands with FLOAD and 101 unrelated matched normal controls among Chinese Han        population. Results show a significantly lower rate of mutation in APP and PSENs,        and APOE ε4 genetic risk is higher for FLOAD. Among the Chinese FLOAD population,        the most frequent variant was CR1 rs116806486 [5.6%, 95% CI (1.8%, 12.5%)],        followed by coding variants of TREM2 (4.4%, 95%CI (1.2%, 10.9%)) and novel        mutations of ACE [3.3%, 95%CI (0.7%, 9.4%)]. Next, we found that novel pathogenic        mutations in ACE including frame-shift and nonsense mutations were in association        with FLOAD regardless of APOE ε4 status. Evidence from the Alzheimer's disease        Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database also supported this finding in different        ethnicities.

The etiology of AD is complex        and remains incompletely understood. In recent years, genome-wide association        studies (GWAS) have increasingly highlighted the central role of microglia in AD        pathology. As a trans-membrane receptor specifically present on the microglia in        the central nervous system, phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C gamma 2        (PLCγ2) plays an important role in neuroinflammation. GWAS data and corresponding        pathological research have explored the effects of PLCG2 variants on amyloid        burden and tau pathologies that underline AD. The link between PLCγ2 and other        AD-related effectors in human and mouse microglia has also been established,        placing PLCγ2 downstream of the triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2        (TREM2), toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK), and        colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R). Because the research on PLCγ2's        role in AD is still in its early stages, few articles have been published,        therefore in this paper, we integrate the relevant research published to date,        review the structural features, expression patterns, and related pathways of        PLCγ2, and summarize the recent studies on important PLCG2 variants related to        AD.

Multiple studies have indicated that nanomaterials        can be used to successfully treat CNS disorders in the case of neurodegeneration.        Nanomedicine development for the cure of degenerative and inflammatory diseases        of the nervous system is critical. Nanoparticles may act as a drug transporter        that can precisely target sick brain sub-regions, boosting therapy success. It is        important to develop strategies that can penetrate the blood-brain barrier (BBB)        and improve the effectiveness of medications. One of the probable tactics is the        use of different nanoscale materials. These nano-based pharmaceuticals offer low        toxicity, tailored delivery, high stability, and drug loading capacity. They may        also increase therapeutic effectiveness. A few examples of the many different        kinds and forms of nanomaterials that have been widely employed to treat        neurological diseases include quantum dots, dendrimers, metallic nanoparticles,        polymeric nanoparticles, carbon nanotubes, liposomes, and micelles. These unique        qualities, including sensitivity, selectivity, and ability to traverse the BBB        when employed in nano-sized particles, make these nanoparticles useful for        imaging studies and treatment of NDs. Multifunctional nanoparticles carrying        pharmacological medications serve two purposes: they improve medication        distribution while also enabling cell dynamics imaging and pharmacokinetic study.        However, because of the potential for wide-ranging clinical implications, safety        concerns persist, limiting any potential for translation.

Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a risk factor for cognitive decline,        dementia and Alzheimer's disease (AD). We investigated the association of        polygenic risk score (PRS) for LOAD with overall cognitive functioning and        longitudinal decline, among older adults with T2D. METHODS: The study included        1046 Jewish participants from the Israel Diabetes and Cognitive Decline (IDCD)        study, aged ≥ 65 years, diagnosed with T2D, and cognitively normal at baseline.        The PRS included variants from 26 LOAD associated loci (at genome-wide        significance level), and was calculated with and without APOE. Outcome measures,        assessed in 18 months intervals, were global cognition and the specific domains        of episodic memory, attention/working memory, executive functions, and        language/semantic categorization. Random coefficient models were used for        analysis, adjusting for demographic variables, T2D-related characteristics, and        cardiovascular factors. Additionally, in a subsample of 202 individuals, we        analyzed the association of PRS with the volumes of total gray matter, frontal        lobe, hippocampus, amygdala, and white matter hyperintensities. Last, the        association of PRS with amyloid beta (Aβ) burden was examined in 44 participants        who underwent an (18)F-flutemetamol PET scan. RESULTS: The PRS was not        significantly associated with overall functioning or decline in global cognition        or any of the specific cognitive domains. Similarly, following correction for        multiple testing, there was no association with Aβ burden and other brain imaging        phenotypes. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that the cumulative effect of LOAD        susceptibility loci is not associated with a greater rate of cognitive decline in        older adults with T2D, and other pathways may underlie this link.",e7dec588b0b0ec2703d50298f38c189adc686bef,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/e7dec588b0b0ec2703d50298f38c189adc686bef,36110429,PMC9468264,,False,Frontiers in aging neuroscience,101525824

Microglia in normal brain is quiescent and        show ramified morphology with numerous branching processes. They constantly        survey their surrounding microenvironment through the extension and retraction of        their processes and interact with neurons, astrocytes, and blood vessels using        these processes. Microglia respond quickly to any pathological event in the brain        by assuming ameboid morphology devoid of branching processes and restore        homeostasis. However, when there is chronic inflammation, microglia may lose        their homeostatic functions and secrete various proinflammatory cytokines and        mediators that initiate neural dysfunction and neurodegeneration. In this        article, we review the role of microglia in the normal brain and in various        pathological brain conditions, such as Alzheimer's disease and multiple        sclerosis.

Here, we assess the responses of mixed-sex and sex-specific        APOE3 and APOE4 primary microglia (PMG) to lipopolysaccharide and        interferon-gamma. In our investigation, inflammatory cytokine profiles were        assessed by qPCR and multiplex ELISA assays. Mixed-sex APOE4 PMG exhibited higher        basal mRNA expression and secreted levels of TNFa and IL1b. In sex-specific        cultures, basal expression and secreted levels of IL1b, TNFa, IL6, and NOS2 were        2−3 fold higher in APOE4 female PMG compared to APOE4 males, with both higher        than APOE3 cells. Following an inflammatory stimulus, the expression of        pro-inflammatory cytokines and the secreted cytokine level were upregulated in        the order E4 female > E4 male > E3 female > E3 male in sex-specific cultures.        These data indicate that the APOE4 genotype and female sex together contribute to        a greater inflammatory response in PMG isolated from targeted replacement        humanized APOE mice.

Despite growing interest        in studying manifestations of Alzheimer's disease (AD) in the retina, a CNS organ        accessible to noninvasive high-resolution imaging, to date MGnD microglia have        not been studied in the AD retina. Here, we discovered the presence and increased        populations of Clec7a(+) and Galectin-3(+) MGnD microglia in retinas of        transgenic APP(SWE)/PS1(L166P) AD-model mice. Conditionally targeting MGnD        microglia by miR-155 ablation via the tamoxifen-inducible Cre(ERT2) system in        APP(SWE)/PS1(L166P) mice diminished retinal Clec7a(+) and Galectin-3(+)        microglial populations while increasing homeostatic P2ry12(+) microglia.

However, in        FTD, associations between genotypes and cognitive phenotypes are yet to be        explored. Here, we evaluate a possible relationship between genetic variants and        some cognitive functions in an FTD population.

Accumulating data support the        contributions of the peripheral immune system in AD pathogenesis. However, there        is a lack of comprehensive understanding about the molecular characteristics of        peripheral immune cells in AD. METHODS: To explore the alterations of cellular        composition and the alterations of intrinsic expression of individual cell types        in peripheral blood, we performed cellular deconvolution in a large-scale bulk        blood expression cohort and identified cell-intrinsic differentially expressed        genes in individual cell types with adjusting for cellular proportion. RESULTS:        We detected a significant increase and decrease in the proportion of neutrophils        and B lymphocytes in AD blood, respectively, which had a robust replicability        across other three AD cohorts, as well as using alternative algorithms. The        differentially expressed genes in AD neutrophils were enriched for some        AD-associated pathways, such as ATP metabolic process and mitochondrion        organization. We also found a significant enrichment of protein-protein        interaction network modules of leukocyte cell-cell activation, mitochondrion        organization, and cytokine-mediated signaling pathway in neutrophils for AD risk        genes including CD33 and IL1B. Both changes in cellular composition and        expression levels of specific genes were significantly associated with the        clinical and pathological alterations.

Apolipoprotein        E4 (APOE4), the highest genetic risk factor for late-onset AD, has been shown to        exacerbate tau hyperphosphorylation in mouse models. However, the exact        mechanisms through which APOE4 induces tau hyperphosphorylation remains unknown.        Here, we report that the astrocyte-secreted protein glypican-4 (GPC-4), which we        identify as a binding partner of APOE4, drives tau hyperphosphorylation. We        discovered that first, GPC-4 preferentially interacts with APOE4 in comparison to        APOE2, considered to be a protective allele to AD, and second, that postmortem        APOE4-carrying AD brains highly express GPC-4 in neurotoxic astrocytes.        Furthermore, the astrocyte-secreted GPC-4 induced both tau accumulation and        propagation in vitro. CRISPR/dCas9-mediated activation of GPC-4 in a tauopathy        mouse model robustly induced tau hyperphosphorylation. In the absence of GPC4,        APOE4-induced tau hyperphosphorylation was largely diminished using in vitro tau        fluorescence resonance energy transfer-biosensor cells, in human-induced        pluripotent stem cell-derived astrocytes and in an in vivo mouse model. We        further show that APOE4-mediated surface trafficking of APOE receptor low-density        lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 through GPC-4 can be a gateway to tau        spreading.

T3-treated animals also displayed reduced immobility        time in both the tail suspension and forced swim tests, and in the latter        presented a higher latency time compared to the control group. Therefore, our        findings suggest that in an AD mouse model, T3 supplementation promotes        improvements in depression-like behavior, through the modulation of the        serotonergic related genes involved in the transmission mediated by 5HT1A        receptors and serotonin reuptake, and attenuated disease progression.",83f89245a60e51470c04308f0162c1940a594cd7,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/83f89245a60e51470c04308f0162c1940a594cd7,35951206,,background,False,Metabolic brain disease,8610370

Cerebral diseases are        greatly affected by cerebral metabolism, including the anabolism and catabolism        of neurotransmitters, hormones, neurotrophic molecules and other brain-specific        chemicals. Natural medicines (NMs) have the advantages of low cost and low        toxicity. NMs are potential treatments for cerebral diseases due to their ability        to regulate cerebral metabolism.

[(18)F]THK-5351 has been shown to be able to detect reactive        astrogliosis as well as tau accompanied by neurodegenerative changes. We        evaluated the [(18)F]THK-5351 retention patterns in positron-emission tomography        (PET) and the clinical characteristics of patients clinically diagnosed with AD        dementia who had negative amyloid PET findings. METHODS: We performed 3.0-T        magnetic resonance imaging, [(18)F]THK-5351 PET, and amyloid PET in 164 patients        with AD dementia. Amyloid PET was visually scored as positive or negative.        [(18)F]THK-5351 PET were visually classified as having an intratemporal or        extratemporal spread pattern. RESULTS: The 164 patients included 23 (14.0%) who        were amyloid-negative (age 74.9±8.3 years, mean±standard deviation; 9 males, 14        females). Amyloid-negative patients were older, had a higher prevalence of        diabetes mellitus, and had better visuospatial and memory functions. The        frequency of the apolipoprotein E ε4 allele was higher and the hippocampal volume        was smaller in amyloid-positive patients. [(18)F]THK-5351 uptake patterns of the        amyloid-negative patients were classified into intratemporal spread (n=10) and        extratemporal spread (n=13). Neuropsychological test results did not differ        significantly between these two groups. The standardized uptake value ratio of        [(18)F]THK-5351 was higher in the extratemporal spread group (2.01±0.26 vs.        1.61±0.15, p=0.001).

10.1186/s13024-022-00545-9,CX3CR1 deficiency aggravates amyloid driven neuronal pathology and cognitive decline in Alzheimer’s disease,2022.0,"BACKGROUND: Despite its identification as a key checkpoint regulator of        microglial activation in Alzheimer's disease, the overarching role of CX3CR1        signaling in modulating mechanisms of Aβ driven neurodegeneration, including        accumulation of hyperphosphorylated tau is not well understood. METHODOLOGY:        Accumulation of soluble and insoluble Aβ species, microglial activation, synaptic        dysregulation, and neurodegeneration is investigated in 4- and 6-month old        5xFAD;Cx3cr1(+/+) and 5xFAD;Cx3cr1(-/-) mice using immunohistochemistry, western        blotting, transcriptomic and quantitative real time PCR analyses of purified        microglia. Flow cytometry based, in-vivo Aβ uptake assays are used for        characterization of the effects of CX3CR1-signaling on microglial phagocytosis        and lysosomal acidification as indicators of clearance of methoxy-X-04(+)        fibrillar Aβ. Lastly, we use Y-maze testing to analyze the effects of Cx3cr1        deficiency on working memory. RESULTS: Disease progression in 5xFAD;Cx3cr1(-/-)        mice is characterized by increased deposition of filamentous plaques that display        defective microglial plaque engagement. Microglial Aβ phagocytosis and lysosomal        acidification in 5xFAD;Cx3cr1(-/-) mice is impaired in-vivo. Interestingly,        Cx3cr1 deficiency results in heighted accumulation of neurotoxic, oligomeric Aβ,        along with severe neuritic dystrophy, preferential loss of post-synaptic        densities, exacerbated tau pathology, neuronal loss and cognitive impairment.        Transcriptomic analyses using cortical RNA, coupled with qRT-PCR using purified        microglia from 6 month-old mice indicate dysregulated TGFβ-signaling and        heightened ROS metabolism in 5xFAD;Cx3cr1(-/-) mice. Lastly, microglia in        6 month-old 5xFAD;Cx3cr1(-/-) mice express a 'degenerative' phenotype        characterized by increased levels of Ccl2, Ccl5, Il-1β, Pten and Cybb along with        reduced Tnf, Il-6 and Tgfβ1 mRNA. CONCLUSIONS: Cx3cr1 deficiency impairs        microglial uptake and degradation of fibrillar Aβ, thereby triggering increased        accumulation of neurotoxic Aβ species. Furthermore, loss of Cx3cr1 results in        microglial dysfunction typified by dampened TGFβ-signaling, increased oxidative        stress responses and dysregulated pro-inflammatory activation. Our results        indicate that Aβ-driven microglial dysfunction in Cx3cr1(-/-) mice aggravates tau        hyperphosphorylation, neurodegeneration, synaptic dysregulation and impairs        working memory.",2e8726080557ee45986a7bc2326e0002b4e20f4f,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/2e8726080557ee45986a7bc2326e0002b4e20f4f,35764973,PMC9241248,background,False,Molecular neurodegeneration,101266600

POD has been associated with a prolonged intensive care and hospital stay,        long-term neurocognitive deterioration, and increased mortality. However, the        specific pathogenesis of POD is still unclear. Untargeted metabolomics techniques        can be used to understand the changes of serum metabolites in early POD to        discover the relationship between serum metabolites and disease. MATERIALS AND        METHODS: The present study recruited 58 elderly patients undergoing cardiac        surgery with CPB. Serum was collected within the first 24 h after surgery. The        Confusion Assessment Method (CAM) and ICU-CAM assessments were used to identify        patients who experienced POD. All patients with normal post-operative cognitive        assessment were included in the non-POD groups. Moreover, we collected serum from        20 healthy adult volunteers. We performed untargeted analyses of post-operative        serum metabolites in all surgical groups, as well as serum metabolites in healthy        non-surgical adults by using liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC/MS) and        analyzed metabolic profiles and related metabolites. RESULTS: The probability of        POD after cardiac surgery were 31%. There were statistically significant        differences in post-operative mechanical ventilation time, ICU stay time and        post-operative hospital stay between POD and non-POD group (P < 0.05). And ICU        stay time was an independent risk factor for POD. The analysis revealed that a        total of 51 differentially expressed metabolites (DEMs) were identified by        comparing the POD and non-POD group, mostly lipids and lipid-like molecules.        Three phosphatidylinositol (PI) were down-regulated in POD group, i.e., PI        [18:0/18:2 (9Z, 12Z)], PI [20:4 (8Z, 11Z, 14Z, 17Z)/18:0], and PI [18:1 (9Z)/20:3        (8Z, 11Z, 14Z)]. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis        showed that three kinds of PI metabolites had the highest area under the curve        (AUC), which were 0.789, 0.781, and 0.715, respectively. Correlation analysis        showed that the expression of three PIs was negatively correlated with the        incidence of POD. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that lipid metabolism plays an        important role in the serum metabolic profile of elderly patients with POD in the        early post-operative period. Low serum lipid metabolic PI was associated with        incidence of POD in elderly following cardiac bypass surgery, which may provide        new insights into the pathogenesis of POD.",cb11fb449b3f1ed4957bc56f4727510080c8e798,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/cb11fb449b3f1ed4957bc56f4727510080c8e798,35754961,PMC9226449,background,False,Frontiers in aging neuroscience,101525824

With no cure available,        limited treatments mostly focus on symptom management. Identifying early changes        in the disease course may provide new therapeutic targets to halt or reverse        disease progression. Clinical studies have shown that cortical and hippocampal        hyperactivity are a feature shared by patients in the early stages of disease,        progressing to hypoactivity during later stages of neurodegeneration. The exact        mechanisms causing neuronal excitability changes are not fully characterized;        however, animal and cell models have provided insights into some of the factors        involved in this phenotype. In this review, we summarize the evidence for        neuronal excitability changes over the course of AD onset and progression and the        molecular mechanisms underpinning these differences. Specifically, we discuss        contributors to aberrant neuronal excitability, including abnormal levels of        intracellular Ca(2+) and glutamate, pathological amyloid β (Aβ) and tau, genetic        risk factors, including APOE, and impaired inhibitory interneuron and glial        function. In light of recent research indicating hyperexcitability could be a        predictive marker of cognitive dysfunction, we further argue that the        hyperexcitability phenotype could be leveraged to improve the diagnosis and        treatment of AD, and present potential targets for future AD treatment        development.",306e3f55bee828818559ed7af6e1669aae5fa861,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/306e3f55bee828818559ed7af6e1669aae5fa861,35732622,PMC9217953,background,False,Translational psychiatry,101562664

The consistent spatiotemporal progression of tau pathology in        Alzheimer's disease (AD) led to the hypothesis that tau aggregates spread in the        brain via bioactive tau ""seeds"" underlying advancing disease course. Recent        studies implicate microglia, the resident immune cells of the central nervous        system, in both negative and positive regulation of tau pathology. Polymorphisms        in genes that alter microglial function are associated with the development of AD        and other tauopathies. Experimental manipulation of microglia function can alter        tau pathology and microglia-mediated neuroinflammatory cascades can exacerbate        tau pathology. Microglia also exert protective functions by mitigating tau        spread: microglia internalize tau seeds and have the capacity to degrade them.        However, when microglia fail to degrade these tau seeds there are deleterious        consequences, including secretion of exosomes containing tau that can spread to        neurons. This review explores the intersection of microglia and tau from the        perspective of neuropathology, neuroimaging, genetics, transcriptomics, and        molecular biology.

In this study, we used        DNA methylation derived telomere length (DNAmTL) as a novel approach to        investigate the role of alcohol use on the aging process. DNAmTL was estimated by        140 cytosine phosphate guanines (CpG) sites in 372 individuals with alcohol use        disorder (AUD) and 243 healthy controls (HC) and assessed using various        endophenotypes and clinical biomarkers. Validation in an independent sample of        DNAmTL on alcohol consumption was performed (N = 4219). Exploratory genome-wide        association studies (GWAS) on DNAmTL were also performed to identify genetic        variants contributing to DNAmTL shortening. Top GWAS findings were analyzed using        in-silico expression quantitative trait loci analyses and related to structural        MRI hippocampus volumes of individuals with AUD. DNAmTL was 0.11-kilobases        shorter per year in AUD compared to HC after adjustment for age, sex, race, and        blood cell composition (p = 4.0 × 10(-12)). This association was partially        attenuated but remained significant after additionally adjusting for BMI, and        smoking status (0.06 kilobases shorter per year, p = 0.002). DNAmTL shortening        was strongly associated with chronic heavy alcohol use (ps < 0.001), elevated        gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT), and aspartate aminotransferase (AST)        (ps < 0.004). Comparison of DNAmTL with PCR-based methods of assessing TL        revealed positive correlations (R = 0.3, p = 2.2 × 10(-5)), highlighting the        accuracy of DNAmTL as a biomarker. The GWAS meta-analysis identified a single        nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), rs4374022 and 18 imputed ones in Thymocyte        Expressed, Positive Selection Associated 1(TESPA1), at the genome-wide level        (p = 3.75 × 10(-8)).

Apart from Aβ and NFT pathologies, AD patients also exhibit a        widespread microglial activation in various brain regions with elevated        production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, a phenomenon known as        neuroinflammation. In healthy central nervous system, microglia adopt ramified,        ""surveying"" phenotype with compact cell bodies and elongated processes. In AD,        the presence of pathogenic proteins such as extracellular Aβ plaques and        hyperphosphorylated tau, induce the transformation of ramified microglia into        amoeboid microglia. Ameboid microglia are highly phagocytic immune cells and        actively secrete a cascade of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. However,        the phagocytic ability of microglia gradually declines with age, and thus the        clearance of pathogenic proteins becomes highly ineffective, leading to the        accumulation of Aβ plaques and hyperphosphorylated tau in the aging brain. The        accumulation of pathogenic proteins further augments the neuroinflammatory        responses and sustains the activation of microglia. The excessive production of        pro-inflammatory cytokines induces a massive loss of functional synapses and        neurons, further worsening the disease condition of AD.

Symptoms begin with mild memory difficulties and evolve towards        cognitive impairment. The underlying risk factors remain primarily unclear for        this heterogeneous disorder. Bioinformatics is a relevant research tool that        allows for identifying several pathways related to AD. Open-access databases of        RNA microarrays from the peripheral blood and brain of AD patients were analyzed        after background correction and data normalization; the Limma package was used        for differential expression analysis (DEA) through statistical R programming        language. Data were corrected with the Benjamini and Hochberg approach, and genes        with p-values equal to or less than 0.05 were considered to be significant. The        direction of the change in gene expression was determined by its variation in the        log2-fold change between healthy controls and patients. We performed the        functional enrichment analysis of GO using goana and topGO-Limma. The functional        enrichment analysis of DEGs showed upregulated (UR) pathways: behavior, nervous        systems process, postsynapses, enzyme binding; downregulated (DR) were cellular        component organization, RNA metabolic process, and signal transduction.

These conditions        make people with AD hard or almost impossible to take care of. Multiple internal        and external pathological factors may affect or even trigger the initiation and        progression of AD. DNA methylation is one of the most effective regulatory roles        during AD pathogenesis, and pathological methylation alterations may be        potentially different in the various brain structures of people with AD. Although        multiple loci associated with AD initiation and progression have been identified,        the spatial distribution patterns of AD-associated DNA methylation in the brain        have not been clarified. According to the systematic methylation profiles on        different structural brain regions, we applied multiple machine learning        algorithms to investigate such profiles. First, the profile on each brain region        was analyzed by the Boruta feature filtering method. Some important methylation        features were extracted and further analyzed by the max-relevance and        min-redundancy method, resulting in a feature list. Then, the incremental feature        selection method, incorporating some classification algorithms, adopted such list        to identify candidate AD-associated loci at methylation with structural        specificity, establish a group of quantitative rules for revealing the effects of        DNA methylation in various brain regions (i.e., four brain structures) on AD        pathogenesis. Furthermore, some efficient classifiers based on essential        methylation sites were proposed to identify AD samples.

The ε4 allele of        the apolipoprotein E (ApoE) gene is the strongest known genetic risk factor for        late-onset AD. Triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2) is        another important risk factor affecting the AD process after ApoE. Emerging        evidence has identified TREM2 as a putative receptor for ApoE, raising the        possibility that interactions between ApoE and TREM2 modulate the pathogenesis of        AD. In this study, we performed molecular docking and molecular dynamics (MD)        analyses to characterize the ApoE-TREM2 interaction and further investigated the        effect of the major TREM2 disease-associated mutation (R47H) on the affinity of        TREM2 for ApoE. The results indicate that the binding energy between ApoE and        TREM2 occurs in an isoform-dependent manner with the following potency rank        order: ApoE4 > ApoE3 > ApoE2. In addition, the R47H mutant reduced the        interaction between ApoE and TREM2 protein, which may be attributed to decreased        hydrogen-bonding interactions, hydrophobic interactions, and electrostatic forces        between ApoE and TREM2. Our study analyzed the molecular pattern of the        interactions between ApoE and TREM2 and how the variants affect these        interactions based on in silico modeling, and the results might help to elucidate        the interaction mechanism between ApoE and TREM2.

It has        been posited that traffic-related air pollution (TRAP) promotes AD neuropathology        by exacerbating neuroinflammation. To test this hypothesis, serum and hippocampal        cytokines were quantified in male and female TgF344-AD rats and wildtype (WT)        Fischer 344 littermates exposed to TRAP or filtered air (FA) from 1 to 15 months        of age.

Age had a        pronounced effect on both serum and hippocampal cytokines; however, age-related        changes in hippocampus were not mirrored in the serum and vice versa. Age-related        changes in serum cytokine levels were not influenced by sex, genotype, or TRAP        exposure. However, in the hippocampus, in 3-month-old TgF344-AD and WT animals,        TRAP increased IL-1ß in females while increasing TNF ɑin males. In 6-month-old        animals, TRAP increased hippocampal levels of M-CSF in TgF344-AD and WT females        but had no significant effect in males. At 10 and 15 months of age, there were        minimal effects of TRAP, genotype or sex on hippocampal cytokines. These        observations demonstrate that TRAP triggers an early inflammatory response in the        hippocampus that differs with sex and age and is not reflected in the serum        cytokine profile.

The accumulation of        misfolded protein aggregates including amyloid beta (Aβ) peptides and microtubule        associated protein tau (MAPT/tau) in neuronal cells are hallmarks of AD. So far,        the exact underlying mechanisms for the aetiologies of AD have not been fully        understood and the effective treatment for AD is limited. Autophagy is an        evolutionarily conserved cellular catabolic process by which damaged cellular        organelles and protein aggregates are degraded via lysosomes. Recently, there is        accumulating evidence linking the impairment of the autophagy-lysosomal pathway        with AD pathogenesis. Interestingly, the enhancement of autophagy to remove        protein aggregates has been proposed as a promising therapeutic strategy for AD.        Here, we first summarize the recent genetic, pathological and experimental        studies regarding the impairment of the autophagy-lysosomal pathway in AD. We        then describe the interplay between the autophagy-lysosomal pathway and two        pathological proteins, Aβ and MAPT/tau, in AD.

It was first        described more than a century ago, and scientists are acquiring new data and        learning novel information about the disease every day. Although there are        nuances and details continuously being unraveled, many key players were        identified in the early 1900's by Dr. Oskar Fischer and Dr. Alois Alzheimer,        including amyloid-beta (Aβ), tau, vascular abnormalities, gliosis, and a possible        role of infections. More recently, there has been growing interest in and        appreciation for neurovascular unit dysfunction that occurs early in mild        cognitive impairment (MCI) before and independent of Aβ and tau brain        accumulation. In the last decade, evidence that Aβ and tau oligomers are        antimicrobial peptides generated in response to infection has expanded our        knowledge and challenged preconceived notions. The concept that pathogenic germs        cause infections generating an innate immune response (e.g., Aβ and tau produced        by peripheral organs) that is associated with incident dementia is worthwhile        considering in the context of sporadic AD with an unknown root cause.

OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study was to develop and analyze novel        biomarkers that can help predict the development and progression of DAT. METHODS:        We used feature selection and ensemble learning classifier to develop an        image/genotype-based DAT score that represents a subject's likelihood of        developing DAT in the future. Three feature types were used: MRI only, genetic        only, and combined multimodal data. We used a novel data stratification method to        better represent different stages of DAT. Using a pre-defined 0.5 threshold on        DAT scores, we predicted whether a subject would develop DAT in the future.        RESULTS: Our results on Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI)        database showed that dementia scores using genetic data could better predict        future DAT progression for currently normal control subjects (Accuracy = 0.857)        compared to MRI (Accuracy = 0.143), while MRI can better characterize subjects        with stable mild cognitive impairment (Accuracy = 0.614) compared to genetics        (Accuracy = 0.356). Combining MRI and genetic data showed improved classification        performance in the remaining stratified groups.

Also, drug sensitivity analysis was performed on        diagnostic genes. To identify the differentially expressed immune genes in the AS        and control groups, we analyzed the composition of immune cells between them.        Then, we examined differentially expressed genes in three AS interspinous        ligament specimens and three Degenerative lumbar spine specimens using        high-throughput sequencing while the immune cells were examined using the        neutrophil count data from routine blood tests of 1770 HLA-B27-positive samples        and 7939 HLA-B27-negative samples. To assess the relationship between ANXA3 and        SORL1 and disease activity, we took the neutrophil counts of the first 50        patients with above-average BASDAI scores and the last 50 patients with        below-average BASDAI scores for statistical analysis. We used        immunohistochemistry to verify the expression of ANXA3 and SORL1 in AS and in        controls. RESULTS: ANXA3 and SORL1 were identified as new diagnostic genes for        AS. These two genes showed a significant differential expression between AS and        controls, along with showing a significant positive correlation with the        neutrophil count. The results of high-throughput sequencing verified that these        two gene deletions were indeed differentially expressed in AS versus controls.        Data from a total of 9707 routine blood tests showed that the neutrophil count        was significantly higher in AS patients than in controls (p < 0.001). Patients        with AS with a high BASDAI score had a much higher neutrophil count than those        with a low score, and the difference was statistically significant (p < 0.001).        The results of immunohistochemistry showed that the expression of ANXA3 and SORL1        in AS was significantly higher than that in the control group.

Changes in expression of human chromosome 21        (Hsa21)-encoded genes, such as amyloid precursor protein (APP), play an important        role in the pathogenesis of AD in DS (DS-AD). However, the mechanisms of DS-AD        remain poorly understood. To date, several mouse models with an extra copy of        genes syntenic to Hsa21 have been developed to characterise DS-AD-related        phenotypes.

Furthermore, the present review        also draws attention to other uninvestigated early- and late-onset Alzheimer's        disease genes to elucidate the relationship between this multifactorial disease        and COVID-19.",b4ed8e2bff539b8bd96408f38d947d1dd35b574d,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/b4ed8e2bff539b8bd96408f38d947d1dd35b574d,35429259,PMC9012910,,False,"Journal of neural transmission (Vienna, Austria : 1996)",9702341

However, the precise mechanistic effects of most        of these variants have yet to be determined. Deeply phenotyped cohort data can        reveal physiological changes associated with genetic risk for AD across an age        spectrum that may provide clues to the biology of the disease. We utilized over        2000 high-quality quantitative measurements obtained from blood of 2831        cognitively normal adult clients of a consumer-based scientific wellness company,        each with CLIA-certified whole-genome sequencing data. Measurements included:        clinical laboratory blood tests, targeted chip-based proteomics, and        metabolomics. We performed a phenome-wide association study utilizing this        diverse blood marker data and 25 known AD genetic variants and an AD-specific        polygenic risk score (PGRS), adjusting for sex, age, vendor (for clinical labs),        and the first four genetic principal components; sex-SNP interactions were also        assessed. We observed statistically significant SNP-analyte associations for five        genetic variants after correction for multiple testing (for SNPs in or near        NYAP1, ABCA7, INPP5D, and APOE), with effects detectable from early adulthood.        The ABCA7 SNP and the APOE2 and APOE4 encoding alleles were associated with lipid        variability, as seen in previous studies; in addition, six novel proteins were        associated with the e2 allele. The most statistically significant finding was        between the NYAP1 variant and PILRA and PILRB protein levels, supporting previous        functional genomic studies in the identification of a putative causal variant        within the PILRA gene. We did not observe associations between the PGRS and any        analyte. Sex modified the effects of four genetic variants, with multiple        interrelated immune-modulating effects associated with the PICALM variant. In        post-hoc analysis, sex-stratified GWAS results from an independent AD        case-control meta-analysis supported sex-specific disease effects of the PICALM        variant, highlighting the importance of sex as a biological variable. Known AD        genetic variation influenced lipid metabolism and immune response systems in a        population of non-AD individuals, with associations observed from early adulthood        onward.

By promoting the        activation of Rab5, RIN3 plays an important role in regulating endocytosis and        endocytic trafficking. In addition, RIN3 activates Ras, another small GTPase,        that controls multiple signaling pathways to regulate cellular function.        Increasing evidence suggests that dysregulation of RIN3 activity may contribute        to the pathogenesis of several disease conditions ranging from Paget's Disease of        the Bone (PDB), Alzheimer's Disease (AD), Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease        (COPD) and to obesity. Recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) identified        variants in the RIN3 gene to be linked with these disease conditions.        Interestingly, some variants appear to be missense mutations in the functional        domains of the RIN3 protein while most variants are located in the noncoding        regions of the RIN3 gene, potentially altering its gene expression. However,        neither the protein structure of RIN3 nor its exact function(s) (except for its        GEF activity) has been fully defined.

10.1126/scitranslmed.abl7634,The niacin receptor HCAR2 modulates microglial response and limits disease progression in a mouse model of Alzheimer’s disease,2022.0,"Increased dietary intake of niacin has been correlated with reduced risk of        Alzheimer's disease (AD). Niacin serves as a high-affinity ligand for the        receptor HCAR2 (GPR109A). In the brain, HCAR2 is expressed selectively by        microglia and is robustly induced by amyloid pathology in AD. The genetic        inactivation of Hcar2 in 5xFAD mice, a model of AD, results in impairment of the        microglial response to amyloid deposition, including deficits in gene expression,        proliferation, envelopment of amyloid plaques, and uptake of amyloid-β (Aβ),        ultimately leading to exacerbation of amyloid burden, neuronal loss, and        cognitive deficits. In contrast, activation of HCAR2 with an FDA-approved        formulation of niacin (Niaspan) in 5xFAD mice leads to reduced plaque burden and        neuronal dystrophy, attenuation of neuronal loss, and rescue of working memory        deficits. These data provide direct evidence that HCAR2 is required for an        efficient and neuroprotective response of microglia to amyloid pathology.        Administration of Niaspan potentiates the HCAR2-mediated microglial protective        response and consequently attenuates amyloid-induced pathology, suggesting that        its use may be a promising therapeutic approach to AD that specifically targets        the neuroimmune response.",f7f48bb5fe3e61e1604bee518bd37a15c0cf49a1,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/f7f48bb5fe3e61e1604bee518bd37a15c0cf49a1,35320002,PMC10161396,background,False,Science translational medicine,101505086

Gynostemma        Pentaphyllum (Thunb.) Makino (GpM), a Chinese medicinal herb, plays important        roles in anti-inflammation, anti-oxidative stress and anti-tumor, which has been        reported to ameliorate cognitive impairment of AD. However, the neuroprotective        mechanism of GpM remains unclear. This study aims to investigate the targets and        possible signaling pathways of GpM in the treatment of AD. METHODS: Active        compounds of GpM and their putative target proteins were selected from        Traditional Chinese Medicine Systems Pharmacology (TCMSP) Database and Analysis        Platform. AD-associated targets were identified from GeneCards, the Online        Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM) database and the Therapeutic Target Database        (TTD). The intersecting targets of GpM and AD were identified and Gene Ontology        (GO), Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis were carried out to        analyze the mechanism of them. Compound-target-pathway (CTP) network and        protein-protein interaction (PPI) network were constructed and analyzed to        elucidate the correlation between compounds, proteins and pathways. Molecular        docking was performed to further demonstrate the possibility of GpM for AD.        RESULTS: A total of 13 active compounds of GpM, 168 putative target proteins of        compounds and 722 AD-associated targets were identified. Eighteen intersecting        targets of GpM and AD were found and the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR),        interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β), interleukin-6 (IL-6), nitric oxide synthase in        endothelial (NOS3) and serum paraoxonase/arylesterase 1 (PON1) were selected as        the primary targets of GpM in the treatment of AD. The neuroprotective effect of        GPM was related to a variety of pathways, including amoebiasis, HIF-1 signaling        pathway, cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction and so on.

AD was first described at the neuropathological        level in the early 1900s. Today, we have mechanistic insight into select aspects        of AD pathogenesis and have the ability to clinically detect and diagnose AD and        underlying AD pathologies in living patients. These insights demonstrate that AD        is a complex, insidious, degenerative proteinopathy triggered by Aβ aggregate        formation. Over time Aβ pathology drives neurofibrillary tangle (NFT) pathology,        dysfunction of virtually all cell types in the brain, and ultimately, overt        neurodegeneration. Yet, large gaps in our knowledge of AD pathophysiology and        huge unmet medical need remain. Though we largely conceptualize AD as a disease        of aging, heritable and non-heritable factors impact brain physiology, either        continuously or at specific time points during the lifespan, and thereby alter        risk for devolvement of AD. Herein, I describe the lifelong journey of a healthy        brain from birth to death with AD, while acknowledging the many knowledge gaps        that remain regarding our understanding of AD pathogenesis. To ensure the current        lexicon surrounding AD changes from inevitable, incurable, and poorly manageable        to a lexicon of preventable, curable, and manageable we must address these        knowledge gaps, develop therapies that have a bigger impact on clinical symptoms        or progression of disease and use these interventions at the appropriate stage of        disease.",39a2acf36d176150bba654f781eaea1c9811c0ef,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/39a2acf36d176150bba654f781eaea1c9811c0ef,35248124,PMC8898417,,False,Molecular neurodegeneration,101266600

The neuronal isoform of BIN1 (BIN1V1), but not the        non-neuronal isoform (BIN1V9), has been shown to regulate tau-pathology and Aβ        generation via RAB5-mediated endocytosis in neurons. BIN1 directly interacts with        RIN3 to initiate RAB5-mediated endocytosis, which is essential for β-secretase        (BACE1)-mediated β-secretase cleavage of β-amyloid precursor protein (APP) to        generate Amyloid-β (Aβ), the key component of senile plaques in AD. Understanding        the regulatory roles of BIN1 (neuronal BIN1V1) and RIN3 in β-secretase mediated        cleavage of APP and Aβ generation is key to developing novel therapeutics to        delay or prevent AD progression. Neuronal and non-neuronal isoforms of BIN1        (BIN1V1 and BIN1V9, respectively) were introduced with RIN3 into an in vitro        cell-based system to test RIN3-dependent effects of neuronal BIN1V1 and        non-neuronal BIN1V9 on β-secretase-mediated cleavage of APP and Aβ generation.        Confocal microscopy was performed to examine RIN3-dependent subcellular        localization of BIN1V1 and BIN1V9. Western blot analysis was performed to assess        the effects of RIN3 and BIN1V1/BIN1V9 on β-secretase mediated processing of APP.        We enriched cells expressing BIN1V1 without or with RIN3 via FACS to measure Aβ        generation using Aβ ELISA assay, and to evaluate APP internalization by chasing        biotinylated or antibody-labeled cell surface APP. Neuronal BIN1V1 containing the        CLAP domain and non-neuronal BIN1V9 lacking the CLAP domain are the major        isoforms present in the brain. Employing confocal microscopy, we showed that RIN3        differentially regulates the recruitment of both BIN1V1 and BIN1V9 into        RAB5-endosomes. We further showed that BIN1V1, but not BIN1V9, downregulates        β-secretase (BACE1)-mediated processing of APP in a RIN3-dependent manner.        Overexpression of BIN1V1 also attenuated Aβ generation in a RIN3-dependent        manner. Using cell-based internalization assays, we show BIN1V1, but not BIN1V9,        delays the endocytosis of APP, but not of BACE1, into early endosomes, thereby        spatially and temporally separating these two proteins into different cellular        compartments, resulting in reduced cleavage of APP by BACE1 and reduced Aβ        generation-all in a RIN3-dependent manner. Finally, we show that RIN3 sequesters        BIN1V1 in RAB5-positive early endosomes, likely via the CLAP-domain, resulting in        attenuated β-secretase processing of APP and Aβ generation by delaying        endocytosis of APP. Our findings provide new mechanistic data on how two        AD-associated molecules, RIN3 and BIN1 (neuronal BIN1V1), interact to govern Aβ        production, implicating these two proteins as potential therapeutic targets for        the prevention and treatment of AD.",faa33e7b400045c209b2215d99ee001c57050832,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/faa33e7b400045c209b2215d99ee001c57050832,35241726,PMC8894474,,False,Scientific reports,101563288
10.1002/trc2.12244,Bioinformatics pipeline to guide late‐onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD) post‐GWAS studies: Prioritizing transcription regulatory variants within LOAD‐associated regions,2022.0,"INTRODUCTION: As new late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD) genetic risk loci are        identified and brain cell-type specific omics data becomes available, there is an        unmet need for a bioinformatics framework to prioritize genes and variants for        testing in single-cell molecular profiling experiments and validation using        disease models and gene editing technologies. Prior work has characterized and        prioritized active enhancers located in LOAD-genome-wide association study (GWAS)        regions and their potential interactions with candidate genes. The current study        extends this work by focusing on single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within        these LOAD enhancers and their impact on altering transcription factor (TF)        binding. The proposed bioinformatics pipeline progresses from SNPs located in        LOAD-GWAS regions to a filtered set of candidate regulatory SNPs that have a        predicted strong effect on TF binding. METHODS: Active enhancers within        LOAD-associated regions were identified and SNPs located in the enhancers were        catalogued. SNPs that disrupt TF binding sites were prioritized and the        respective TFs were filtered to include only those that were expressed in brain        tissues relevant to LOAD. The TFs binding to the corresponding sequence was        further confirmed by ChIP-seq signals. Finally, the high-priority candidate SNPs        were evaluated as expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) in disease-relevant        tissues. RESULTS: We catalogued 61 strong enhancers in LOAD-GWAS regions        encompassing 326 SNPs and 104 TF binding sites. Seventy-seven and 78 of the TFs        were expressed in brain and monocytes, respectively, out of which 19 TF-binding        sites showed ChIP-seq signals. Eleven SNPs were found to interrupt with TF        binding out of which three SNPs were also significant eQTL. DISCUSSION: This        study provides a framework to catalogue noncoding variations in enhancers located        in LOAD-GWAS loci and characterize their likelihood to perturb TF binding. The        approach integrates multiple data types to characterize and prioritize SNPs for        putative regulatory function using single-cell multi-omics assays and gene        editing.",d3b011554673beedd270083538056a1158778d66,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/d3b011554673beedd270083538056a1158778d66,35229021,PMC8864953,,False,"Alzheimer's & dementia (New York, N.

10.1007/s00018-022-04182-9,The Alzheimer’s gene SORL1 is a regulator of endosomal traffic and recycling in human neurons,2021.0,"BACKGROUND: Loss of the Sortilin-related receptor 1 (SORL1) gene seems to act as        a causal event for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Recent studies have established that        loss of SORL1, as well as mutations in autosomal dominant AD genes APP and        PSEN1/2, pathogenically converge by swelling early endosomes, AD's        cytopathological hallmark. Acting together with the retromer trafficking complex,        SORL1 has been shown to regulate the recycling of the amyloid precursor protein        (APP) out of the endosome, contributing to endosomal swelling and to APP        misprocessing. We hypothesized that SORL1 plays a broader role in neuronal        endosomal recycling and used human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived neurons        (hiPSC-Ns) to test this hypothesis. We examined endosomal recycling of three        transmembrane proteins linked to AD pathophysiology: APP, the BDNF receptor        Tropomyosin-related kinase B (TRKB), and the glutamate receptor subunit AMPA1        (GLUA1). METHODS: We used isogenic hiPSCs engineered to have SORL1 depleted or to        have enhanced SORL1 expression. We differentiated neurons from these cell lines        and mapped the trafficking of APP, TRKB and GLUA1 within the endosomal network        using confocal microscopy. We also performed cell surface recycling and lysosomal        degradation assays to assess the functionality of the endosomal network in both        SORL1-depleted and -overexpressing neurons. The functional impact of GLUA1        recycling was determined by measuring synaptic activity. Finally, we analyzed        alterations in gene expression in SORL1-depleted neurons using RNA sequencing.        RESULTS: We find that as with APP, endosomal trafficking of GLUA1 and TRKB is        impaired by loss of SORL1. We show that trafficking of all three cargoes to late        endosomes and lysosomes is affected by manipulating SORL1 expression. We also        show that depletion of SORL1 significantly impacts the endosomal recycling        pathway for APP and GLUA1 at the level of the recycling endosome and trafficking        to the cell surface. This has a functional effect on neuronal activity as shown        by multi-electrode array (MEA). Conversely, increased SORL1 expression enhances        endosomal recycling for APP and GLUA1. Our unbiased transcriptomic data further        support SORL1's role in endosomal recycling. We observe altered expression        networks that regulate cell surface trafficking and neurotrophic signaling in        SORL1-depleted neurons. CONCLUSION: Collectively, and together with other recent        observations, these findings suggest that one role for SORL1 is to contribute to        endosomal degradation and recycling pathways in neurons, a conclusion that has        both pathogenic and therapeutic implications for Alzheimer's disease.",eb019ea29ea9e0528df4a15810987ca28a008cd2,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/eb019ea29ea9e0528df4a15810987ca28a008cd2,35226190,PMC8885486,background,False,Cellular and molecular life sciences : CMLS,9705402

The two main pathological mechanisms underlying the        disease are beta-amyloid (Aβ) plaques and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles        (NFTs) of Tau proteins in the brain. Their reduction has been associated with        slowing of cognitive decline and disease progression. Several antibodies aimed to        target Aβ or Tau in order to represent hope for millions of patients, but only a        small number managed to be selected to participate in clinical trials. Aducanumab        is a monoclonal antibody recently approved by the Food and Drug Administration        (FDA), which, targeting (Aβ) oligomers and fibrils, was able to reduce Aβ        accumulation and slow the progression of cognitive impairment. It was also        claimed to have an effect on the second hallmark of AD, decreasing the level of        phospho-Tau evaluated in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and by positron emission        tomography (PET).

However, it is not enough to mine only a single marker effect variation        on complex biological phenotypes. Mining highly correlated single nucleotide        polymorphisms (SNP) is more meaningful for the study of Alzheimer's disease (AD).        In this paper, we used two frequent pattern mining (FPM) framework, the FP-Growth        and Eclat algorithms, to analyze the GWAS results of functional magnetic        resonance imaging (fMRI) phenotypes. Moreover, we applied the definition of        confidence to FP-Growth and Eclat to enhance the FPM framework.

10.1007/s40588-021-00168-6,"The Role of Chronic Infection in Alzheimer’s Disease: Instigators, Co-conspirators, or Bystanders?",2021.0,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Herein, we provide a critical review of the clinical and        translational research examining the relationship between viral and bacterial        pathogens and Alzheimer's disease. In addition, we provide an overview of the        biological pathways through which chronic infection may contribute to Alzheimer's        disease. RECENT FINDINGS: Dementia due to Alzheimer's disease is a leading cause        of disability among older adults in developed countries, yet knowledge of the        causative factors that promote Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis remains        incomplete. Over the past several decades, numerous studies have demonstrated an        association of chronic viral and bacterial infection with Alzheimer's disease.        Implicated infectious agents include numerous herpesviruses (HSV-1, HHV-6, HHV-7)        and various gastric, enteric, and oral bacterial species, as well as Chlamydia        pneumonia and multiple spirochetes. SUMMARY: Evidence supports the association        between multiple pathogens and Alzheimer's disease risk. Whether these pathogens        play a causal role in Alzheimer's pathophysiology remains an open question. We        propose that the host immune response to active or latent infection in the        periphery or in the brain triggers or accelerates the Alzheimer's disease        processes, including the accumulation of amyloid-ß and pathogenic tau, and        neuroinflammation. While recent research suggests that such theories are        plausible, additional longitudinal studies linking microorganisms to Aß and        phospho-tau development, neuroinflammation, and clinically defined Alzheimer's        dementia are needed.",3a6f9ec0df3e79b1ee977ab42e7b4e4421bc9a50,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/3a6f9ec0df3e79b1ee977ab42e7b4e4421bc9a50,35186664,PMC8849576,,False,Current clinical microbiology reports,101642669
10.1186/s13073-022-01022-0,PLCG2 is associated with the inflammatory response and is induced by amyloid plaques in Alzheimer’s disease,2022.0,"BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by robust microgliosis and        phenotypic changes that accompany disease pathogenesis. Accumulating evidence        from genetic studies suggests the importance of phospholipase C γ 2 (PLCG2) in        late-onset AD (LOAD) pathophysiology. However, the role of PLCG2 in AD is still        poorly understood. METHODS: Using bulk RNA-Seq (N=1249) data from the        Accelerating Medicines Partnership-Alzheimer's Disease Consortium (AMP-AD), we        investigated whether PLCG2 expression increased in the brains of LOAD patients.        We also evaluated the relationship between PLCG2 expression levels, amyloid        plaque density, and expression levels of microglia specific markers (AIF1 and        TMEM119). Finally, we investigated the longitudinal changes of PLCG2 expression        in the 5xFAD mouse model of AD. To further understand the role of PLCG2 in        different signaling pathways, differential gene expression and co-expression        network analyses were performed using bulk RNA-Seq and microglial single-cell        RNA-Seq data. To substantiate the human analyses, we performed differential gene        expression analysis on wild-type (WT) and inactivated Plcg2 mice and used        immunostaining to determine if the differentially expressed genes/pathways were        altered by microglial cell coverage or morphology. RESULTS: We observed        significant upregulation of PLCG2 expression in three brain regions of LOAD        patients and significant positive correlation of PLCG2 expression with amyloid        plaque density. These findings in the human brain were validated in the 5xFAD        amyloid mouse model, which showed disease progression-dependent increases in        Plcg2 expression associated with amyloid pathology. Of note, increased Plcg2        expression levels in 5xFAD mice were abolished by reducing microglia.        Furthermore, using bulk RNA-Seq data, we performed differential expression        analysis by comparing cognitively normal older adults (CN) with 75th percentile        (high) and 25th percentile (low) PLCG2 gene expression levels to identify        pathways related to inflammation and the inflammatory response. The findings in        the human brain were validated by differential expression analyses between WT and        plcg2 inactivated mice. PLCG2 co-expression network analysis of microglial        single-cell RNA-Seq data identified pathways related to the inflammatory response        including regulation of I-kappaB/NF-kappa B signaling and response to        lipopolysaccharide.

OBJECTIVE: This randomized,        double-blind, placebo-controlled phase I trial (NCT03298672) evaluated the        safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of fosgonimeton.        METHODS: Fosgonimeton was administered once daily via subcutaneous injection to        88 subjects. The single ascending dose study enrolled healthy young male subjects        (n = 48; age, 33.4±6.3 years; dose, 2, 6, 20, 40, 60, or 90 mg); the multiple        ascending dose study enrolled healthy elderly subjects (n = 29; age, 63.8±4.0        years; dose, 20, 40, 60, or 80 mg; 9-day duration); and the fixed-dose study        enrolled AD subjects (n = 11; age, 69.2±7.1 years; dose, 40 mg; 9-day duration).        Quantitative electroencephalogram (qEEG) and event-related potential (ERP) P300        measured neurophysiological signals following fosgonimeton treatment, supporting        brain penetration and target engagement. RESULTS: Fosgonimeton and placebo were        shown to be safe and well-tolerated across all doses. Pharmacokinetic results for        fosgonimeton were dose-proportional, with no sex effect or accumulation over 9        days. The main effect of fosgonimeton on qEEG was acute and sustained gamma power        induction. In AD subjects, there was a significant effect toward ERP P300 latency        normalization compared with placebo (p = 0.027; n = 7 at 40 mg fosgonimeton        versus n = 4 placebo). CONCLUSION: These results support the continued        development of fosgonimeton as a novel therapeutic for people with AD and        dementia.

Yet        so far, we have no molecular map of the human brain vasculature. Here we develop        vessel isolation and nuclei extraction for sequencing (VINE-seq) to profile the        major vascular and perivascular cell types of the human brain through 143,793        single-nucleus transcriptomes from 25 hippocampus and cortex samples of 9        individuals with Alzheimer's disease and 8 individuals with no cognitive        impairment. We identify brain-region- and species-enriched genes and pathways. We        reveal molecular principles of human arteriovenous organization, recapitulating a        gradual endothelial and punctuated mural cell continuum. We discover two subtypes        of human pericytes, marked by solute transport and extracellular matrix (ECM)        organization; and define perivascular versus meningeal fibroblast specialization.        In Alzheimer's disease, we observe selective vulnerability of ECM-maintaining        pericytes and gene expression patterns that implicate dysregulated blood flow.        With an expanded survey of brain cell types, we find that 30 of the top 45 genes        that have been linked to Alzheimer's disease risk by genome-wide association        studies (GWASs) are expressed in the human brain vasculature, and we confirm this        by immunostaining.

However, at present, a large        fraction of the acquired genetic information is not used since pathogenicity        cannot be assessed for most variants. Further complicating this scenario is the        increasingly frequent description of a poli/oligogenic pattern of inheritance        showing the contribution of multiple variants in increasing disease risk. We        present an approach in which the entire genetic information provided by target        sequencing is transformed into binary data on which we performed statistical,        machine learning, and network analyses to extract all valuable information from        the entire genetic profile. To test this approach and unbiasedly explore the        presence of recurrent genetic patterns, we studied a cohort of 112 patients        affected either by genetic Creutzfeldt-Jakob (CJD) disease caused by two        mutations in the PRNP gene (p.E200K and p.V210I) with different penetrance or by        sporadic Alzheimer disease (sAD). RESULTS: Unsupervised methods can identify        functionally relevant sources of variation in the data, like haplogroups and        polymorphisms that do not follow Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, such as the NOTCH3        rs11670823 (c.3837 + 21 T > A). Supervised classifiers can recognize clinical        phenotypes with high accuracy based on the mutational profile of patients. In        addition, we found a similar alteration of allele frequencies compared the        European population in sporadic patients and in V210I-CJD, a poorly penetrant        PRNP mutation, and sAD, suggesting shared oligogenic patterns in different types        of dementia. Pathway enrichment and protein-protein interaction network revealed        different altered pathways between the two PRNP mutations. CONCLUSIONS: We        propose this workflow as a possible approach to gain deeper insights into the        genetic information derived from target sequencing, to identify recurrent genetic        patterns and improve the understanding of complex diseases.

With the increase of individual age,        the quality of cognitive function has become a more and more important topic. The        study of gene loci in patients with MCI is essential for the prevention of        dementia. In this study, we evaluate the gene polymorphism in Chinese Han        patients with MCI by propensity score matching (PSM) and comparing them to        healthy control (HC) subjects. METHODS: Four hundred seventeen patients with mild        cognitive impairment and 508 healthy people were included. The two groups were        matched by applying one-to-one PSM, and the matching tolerance was set to 0.002.        The matching covariates included gender,age,occupation,marital status,living        mode. Then, a case-control associated analysis was conducted to analyze the        genotype and allele frequencies of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the        MCI group and the control group. RESULTS: Three hundred eleven cases were        successfully matched in each group, and there was no statistical difference on        all the matching variables, gender, age, occupation, marital status, living mode        between two groups after the match (P > 0.05). The allele frequency of bridging        integrator 1(BIN1) rs7561528 showed minimal association with MCI in the Han        Chinese population (P = 0.01). Compared with the healthy control (HC) group, A        allele frequency of MCI group patients was significantly decreased. The genotype        frequency of BIN1 rs6733839 showed minimal association with MCI in the recessive        model (P = 0.03). The genotype frequency of rs7561528 showed minimal association        with MCI in the codominant, dominant, overdominant, and log-additive model        (P < 0.05). The genotype frequencies of StAR-related lipid transfer domain 6        (STARD6) rs10164112 showed nominal association with MCI in the codominant,        dominant, and log-additive model (P < 0.05).

The majority of AD research has        been dedicated to the understanding of two major AD hallmarks (i.e. Aβ and NFTs);        however, recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) data indicate        neuroinflammation as having a critical role in late-onset AD (LOAD) development,        thus unveiling a novel avenue for AD therapeutics. Recent evidence has provided        much support to the innate immune system's involvement with AD progression;        however, much remains to be uncovered regarding the role of glial cells,        specifically microglia, in AD. Moreover, numerous variants in immune and/or        microglia-related genes have been identified in whole-genome sequencing and GWAS        analyses, including such genes as TREM2, CD33, APOE, API1, MS4A, ABCA7, BIN1,        CLU, CR1, INPP5D, PICALM and PLCG2.

Multiple susceptibility        loci have been reported to have an increased risk for AD and the morphology of        brain structures are affected by the variations in the risk loci. Therefore, we        hypothesized that genes contributed significantly to the ventricular surface, and        the changes of ventricular surface were associated with the impairment of        cognitive functions. After the quality controls (QC) and genotyping, a lateral        ventricular segmentation method was employed to obtain the surface features of        lateral ventricle. We evaluated the influence of 18 selected AD susceptibility        loci on both volume and surface morphology across 410 subjects from Alzheimer's        Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). Correlations were conducted between        radial distance (RD) and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) subscales. Only the        C allele at the rs744373 loci in BIN1 gene significantly accelerated the atrophy        of lateral ventricle, including the anterior horn, body, and temporal horn of        left lateral ventricle. No significant effect on lateral ventricle was found at        other loci. Our results revealed that most regions of the bilateral ventricular        surface were significantly negatively correlated with cognitive scores,        particularly in delayed recall. Besides, small areas of surface were negatively        correlated with language, orientation, and visuospatial scores.

Alzheimer's have        compounded pathologies of diverse nature, including proteins as one important        factor along with mutated genes and enzymes. Although various review articles        have proposed biomarkers, still, the statistical importance of proteins is        missing. Proteins associated with AD include amyloid precursor protein, glial        fibrillary acidic protein, calmodulin-like skin protein, hepatocyte growth        factor, matrix Metalloproteinase-2. These proteins play a crucial role in the AD        hypothesis which includes the tau hypothesis, amyloid-beta (Aβ) hypothesis,        cholinergic neuron damage, etc. The present review highlights the role of major        proteins and their physiological functions in the early diagnosis of AD. Altered        protein expression results in cognitive impairment, synaptic dysfunction,        neuronal degradation, and memory loss. On the medicinal ground, efforts of making        anti-amyloid, anti-tau, anti-inflammatory treatments are on the peak, having        these proteins as putative targets.

However, utilizing GWAS and        multi-omics data to identify high-confidence AD risk genes (ARGs) and druggable        targets that can guide development of new therapeutics for patients suffering        from AD has heretofore not been successful. METHODS: To address this critical        problem in the field, we have developed a network-based artificial intelligence        framework that is capable of integrating multi-omics data along with human        protein-protein interactome networks to accurately infer accurate drug targets        impacted by GWAS-identified variants to identify new therapeutics. When applied        to AD, this approach integrates GWAS findings, multi-omics data from brain        samples of AD patients and AD transgenic animal models, drug-target networks, and        the human protein-protein interactome, along with large-scale patient database        validation and in vitro mechanistic observations in human microglia cells.        RESULTS: Through this approach, we identified 103 ARGs validated by various        levels of pathobiological evidence in AD. Via network-based prediction and        population-based validation, we then showed that three drugs (pioglitazone,        febuxostat, and atenolol) are significantly associated with decreased risk of AD        compared with matched control populations. Pioglitazone usage is significantly        associated with decreased risk of AD (hazard ratio (HR) = 0.916, 95% confidence        interval [CI] 0.861-0.974, P = 0.005) in a retrospective case-control validation.        Pioglitazone is a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) agonist used        to treat type 2 diabetes, and propensity score matching cohort studies confirmed        its association with reduced risk of AD in comparison to glipizide (HR = 0.921,        95% CI 0.862-0.984, P = 0.0159), an insulin secretagogue that is also used to        treat type 2 diabetes. In vitro experiments showed that pioglitazone        downregulated glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (GSK3β) and cyclin-dependent kinase        (CDK5) in human microglia cells, supporting a possible mechanism-of-action for        its beneficial effect in AD.

Here, we began addressing these questions by showing that neurons are        enriched with a second retromer core, organized around VPS26b, differentially        dedicated to endosomal recycling. Next, by imaging mouse models, we show that the        trans-entorhinal cortex, a region most vulnerable to AD, is most susceptible to        VPS26b depletion-a finding validated by electrophysiology, immunocytochemistry,        and behavior. VPS26b was then found enriched in the trans-entorhinal cortex of        human brains, where both VPS26b and the retromer-related receptor SORL1 were        found deficient in AD. Finally, by regulating glutamate receptor and SORL1        recycling, we show that VPS26b can mediate regionally selective synaptic        dysfunction and SORL1 deficiency.

This axonal rapid endosomal sorting and        transport-dependent aggregation (ARESTA) mechanism forms pathologic PrP        endoggresomes that impair calcium dynamics and reduce neuronal viability.        Inhibiting ARESTA diminishes endoggresome formation, rescues calcium influx, and        prevents neuronal death.

It is        well-established that tau forms pathological aggregates and fibrils in these        diseases. Tau has been observed within the nuclei of neurons, but there is a gap        in understanding regarding the mechanism by which tau modulates transcription. We        are interested in the P301L mutation of tau, which has been associated with FTD        and increased tau aggregation. Our study utilized tau-inducible HEK (iHEK) cells        to reveal that WT and P301L tau distinctively alter the transcription and        alternative polyadenylation (APA) profiles of numerous nuclear precursors mRNAs,        which then translate to form proteins involved in chromatin remodeling and        splicing. We isolated total mRNA before and after over-expressing tau and then        performed Poly(A)-ClickSeq (PAC-Seq) to characterize mRNA expression and APA        profiles. We characterized changes in Gene Ontology (GO) pathways using EnrichR        and Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA). We observed that P301L tau up-regulates        genes associated with reactive oxygen species responsiveness as well as genes        involved in dendrite, microtubule, and nuclear body/speckle formation. The number        of genes regulated by WT tau is greater than the mutant form, which indicates        that the P301L mutation causes loss-of-function at the transcriptional level. WT        tau up-regulates genes contributing to cytoskeleton-dependent intracellular        transport, microglial activation, microtubule and nuclear chromatin organization,        formation of nuclear bodies and speckles. Interestingly, both WT and P301L tau        commonly down-regulate genes responsible for ubiquitin-proteosome system. In        addition, WT tau significantly down-regulates several genes implicated in        chromatin remodeling and nucleosome organization.

10.3390/ijms222111931,Alzheimer’s Disease and Diabetes Mellitus in Comparison: The Therapeutic Efficacy of the Vanadium Compound,2021.0,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an intractable neurodegenerative disease that leads        to dementia, primarily in elderly people. The neurotoxicity of amyloid-beta (Aβ)        and tau protein has been demonstrated over the last two decades. In line with        these findings, several etiological hypotheses of AD have been proposed,        including the amyloid cascade hypothesis, the oxidative stress hypothesis, the        inflammatory hypothesis, the cholinergic hypothesis, et al. In the meantime,        great efforts had been made in developing effective drugs for AD. However, the        clinical efficacy of the drugs that were approved by the US Food and Drug        Association (FDA) to date were determined only mild/moderate. We recently adopted        a vanadium compound bis(ethylmaltolato)-oxidovanadium (IV) (BEOV), which was        originally used for curing diabetes mellitus (DM), to treat AD in a mouse model.        It was shown that BEOV effectively reduced the Aβ level, ameliorated the        inflammation in brains of the AD mice, and improved the spatial learning and        memory activities of the AD mice. These finding encouraged us to further examine        the mechanisms underlying the therapeutic effects of BEOV in AD. In this review,        we summarized the achievement of vanadium compounds in medical studies and        investigated the prospect of BEOV in AD and DM treatment.",964d6d5712c876db4bd204b9ef986519ebde851c,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/964d6d5712c876db4bd204b9ef986519ebde851c,34769364,PMC8584792,background,False,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791

At present, the pathogenesis of DAT is not completely        clear, and there are no drugs that can cure the disease. Once an individual is        diagnosed with DAT, the survival time is only 3 to 9 years. Therefore, there is        an urgent need to determine the etiology of DAT and the associated influencing        factors to find a breakthrough in the treatment of DAT. Methods: We studied the        relationship between polymorphisms in several genes (including BIN1 and APOE) and        DAT susceptibility and the effects of sex differences on DAT. Our study included        137 patients with DAT and 509 healthy controls (HCs). Results: The APOE rs429358        polymorphism CC and CT genotypes were associated with an increased risk of DAT in        women. We found a significant association between APOE ε4 and DAT. The frequency        of the ε4 allele in the DAT group (15.5%) was higher than that in the HC group        (8.7%). The BIN1 rs7561528 polymorphism was associated with a decreased risk of        DAT in men.

10.1111/acel.13511,Insights into T‐cell dysfunction in Alzheimer's disease,2021.0,"T cells, the critical immune cells of the adaptive immune system, are often        dysfunctional in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and are involved in AD pathology.        Reports highlight neuroinflammation as a crucial modulator of AD pathogenesis,        and aberrant T cells indirectly contribute to neuroinflammation by secreting        proinflammatory mediators via direct crosstalk with glial cells infiltrating the        brain. However, the mechanisms underlying T-cell abnormalities in AD appear        multifactorial. Risk factors for AD and pathological hallmarks of AD have been        tightly linked with immune responses, implying the potential regulatory effects        of these factors on T cells. In this review, we discuss how the risk factors for        AD, particularly Apolipoprotein E (ApoE), Aβ, α-secretase, β-secretase,        γ-secretase, Tau, and neuroinflammation, modulate T-cell activation and the        association between T cells and pathological AD hallmarks.

10.3389/fnagi.2021.743573,MicroRNAs as Potential Orchestrators of Alzheimer's Disease-Related Pathologies: Insights on Current Status and Future Possibilities,2021.0,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive and deleterious neurodegenerative        disease, strongly affecting the cognitive functions and memory of seniors        worldwide. Around 58% of the affected patients live in low and middle-income        countries, with estimates of increasing deaths caused by AD in the coming decade.        AD is a multifactor pathology. Mitochondrial function declines in AD brain and is        currently emerging as a hallmark of this disease. It has been considered as one        of the intracellular processes severely compromised in AD. Many mitochondrial        parameters decline already during aging; mitochondrial efficiency for energy        production, reactive oxygen species (ROS) metabolism and the de novo synthesis of        pyrimidines, to reach an extensive functional failure, concomitant with the onset        of neurodegenerative conditions. Besides its impact on cognitive functions, AD is        characterized by loss of synapses, extracellular amyloid plaques composed of the        amyloid-β peptide (Aβ), and intracellular aggregates of hyperphosphorylated Tau        protein, accompanied by drastic sleep disorders, sensory function alterations and        pain sensitization. Unfortunately, till date, effective management of AD-related        disorders and early, non-invasive AD diagnostic markers are yet to be found.        MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding nucleic acids that regulate key signaling        pathway(s) in various disease conditions. About 70% of experimentally detectable        miRNAs are expressed in the brain where they regulate neurite outgrowth,        dendritic spine morphology, and synaptic plasticity. Increasing studies suggest        that miRNAs are intimately involved in synaptic function and specific signals        during memory formation. This has been the pivotal key for considering miRNAs        crucial molecules to be studied in AD. MicroRNAs dysfunctions are increasingly        acknowledged as a pivotal contributor in AD via deregulating genes involved in AD        pathogenesis. Moreover, miRNAs have been proved to control pain sensitization        processes and regulate circadian clock system that affects the sleep process.        Interestingly, the differential expression of miRNA panels implies their emerging        potential as diagnostic AD biomarkers. In this review, we will present an updated        analysis of miRNAs role in regulating signaling processes that are involved in        AD-related pathologies. We will discuss the current challenges against wider use        of miRNAs and the future promising capabilities of miRNAs as diagnostic and        therapeutic means for better management of AD.",5aeb4a9849c32099645d889510233a342d0d5f55,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/5aeb4a9849c32099645d889510233a342d0d5f55,34712129,PMC8546247,,False,Frontiers in aging neuroscience,101525824

Despite exceptional efforts        to understand disease progression via legacy amyloidogenic transgene mouse        models, focus on disease translation with innovative mouse strains that better        model the complexity of human AD is required to accelerate the development of        future treatment modalities. LOAD within the human population is a polygenic and        environmentally influenced disease with many risk factors acting in concert to        produce disease processes parallel to those often muted by the early and        aggressive aggregate formation in popular mouse strains. In addition to        extracellular deposits of amyloid plaques and inclusions of the        microtubule-associated protein tau, AD is also defined by synaptic/neuronal loss,        vascular deficits, and neuroinflammation. These underlying processes need to be        better defined, how the disease progresses with age, and compared to        human-relevant outcomes. To create more translatable mouse models, MODEL-AD        (Model Organism Development and Evaluation for Late-onset AD) groups are        identifying and integrating disease-relevant, humanized gene sequences from        public databases beginning with APOEε4 and Trem2*R47H, two of the most powerful        risk factors present in human LOAD populations. Mice expressing endogenous,        humanized APOEε4 and Trem2*R47H gene sequences were extensively aged and assayed        using a multi-disciplined phenotyping approach associated with and relative to        human AD pathology. Robust analytical pipelines measured behavioral,        transcriptomic, metabolic, and neuropathological phenotypes in cross-sectional        cohorts for progression of disease hallmarks at all life stages. In vivo PET/MRI        neuroimaging revealed regional alterations in glycolytic metabolism and vascular        perfusion. Transcriptional profiling by RNA-Seq of brain hemispheres identified        sex and age as the main sources of variation between genotypes including        age-specific enrichment of AD-related processes. Similarly, age was the strongest        determinant of behavioral change. In the absence of mouse amyloid plaque        formation, many of the hallmarks of AD were not observed in this strain. However,        as a sensitized baseline model with many additional alleles and environmental        modifications already appended, the dataset from this initial MODEL-AD strain        serves an important role in establishing the individual effects and interaction        between two strong genetic risk factors for LOAD in a mouse host.",d6f0f2ce5c2c5daaef93fb32cec6d5166f7204b0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/d6f0f2ce5c2c5daaef93fb32cec6d5166f7204b0,34707490,PMC8544520,,False,Frontiers in aging neuroscience,101525824

However, those        studies using high-throughput methods have been compromised by the lack of Gene        Ontology (GO) annotations describing the role of proteins in the normal function        of the BBB. The GO Consortium provides a gold-standard bioinformatics resource        used for analysis and interpretation of large biomedical data sets. However, the        GO is also used by other research communities and, therefore, must meet a variety        of demands on the breadth and depth of information that is provided. To meet the        needs of the Alzheimer's research community we have focused on the GO annotation        of the BBB, with over 100 transport or junctional proteins prioritized for        annotation. This project has led to a substantial increase in the number of human        proteins associated with BBB-relevant GO terms as well as more comprehensive        annotation of these proteins in many other processes. Furthermore, data        describing the microRNAs that regulate the expression of these priority proteins        have also been curated.

The present study aimed to        investigate the association of APOE ε4 genotypes with brain functional        impairment, as assessed by quantitative EEG (qEEG) in patients on the AD        continuum. The study population included 101 amyloid positive patients diagnosed        with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) (n = 50) and AD (n = 51) that underwent        resting-state EEG recording and CSF Aβ42 analysis. In total, 31 patients were        APOE ε4 non-carriers, 42 were carriers of one, and 28 were carriers of two APOE        ε4 alleles. Quantitative EEG analysis included computation of the global field        power (GFP) and global field synchronization (GFS) in conventional frequency        bands. Amyloid positive patients who were carriers of APOE ε4 allele(s) had        significantly higher GFP beta and significantly lower GFS in theta and beta bands        compared to APOE ε4 non-carriers. Increased global EEG power in beta band in APOE        ε4 carriers may represent a brain functional compensatory mechanism that offsets        global EEG slowing in AD patients.

Since neural anatomy and disease        pathophysiology differ by sex, investigating sex-specific mechanisms in AD        pathophysiology can inform new therapeutic approaches for both sexes. Previous        bulk human brain RNA sequencing studies have revealed sex differences in        dysregulated molecular pathways related to energy production, neuronal function,        and immune response; however, the sex differences in disease mechanisms are yet        to be examined comprehensively on a single-cell level.

10.3389/fnagi.2021.735611,Sex-Specific Cross Tissue Meta-Analysis Identifies Immune Dysregulation in Women With Alzheimer’s Disease,2020.0,"Background: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder        and the most common cause of dementia in the United States. In spite of evidence        of females having a greater lifetime risk of developing Alzheimer's Disease (AD)        and greater apolipoprotein E4-related (APOE ε4) AD risk compared to males,        molecular signatures underlying these differences remain elusive. Methods: We        took a meta-analysis approach to study gene expression in the brains of 1,084 AD        patients and age-matched controls and whole blood from 645 AD patients and        age-matched controls in seven independent datasets. Sex-specific gene expression        patterns were investigated through use of gene-based, pathway-based and        network-based approaches. The ability of a sex-specific AD gene expression        signature to distinguish Alzheimer's disease from healthy controls was assessed        using a linear support vector machine model. Cell type deconvolution from whole        blood gene expression data was performed to identify differentially regulated        cells in males and females with AD. Results: Strikingly gene-expression,        network-based analysis and cell type deconvolution approaches revealed a        consistent immune signature in the brain and blood of female AD patients that was        absent in males. In females, network-based analysis revealed a coordinated        program of gene expression involving several zinc finger nuclease genes related        to Herpes simplex viral infection whose expression was modulated by the presence        of the APOE ε4 allele. Interestingly, this gene expression program was missing in        the brains of male AD patients. Cell type deconvolution identified an increase in        neutrophils and naïve B cells and a decrease in M2 macrophages, memory B cells,        and CD8+ T cells in AD samples compared to controls in females. Interestingly,        among males with AD, no significant differences in immune cell proportions        compared to controls were observed. Machine learning-based classification of AD        using gene expression from whole blood in addition to clinical features produced        an improvement in classification accuracy upon stratifying by sex, achieving an        AUROC of 0.91 for females and 0.80 for males.

We test such a network in a series of three        analytic steps. First, we test independent associations between three risk scores        (functional-health, lifestyle-reserve, and a combined multimodal risk score) and        cognitive [executive function (EF)] trajectories. Second, we test whether all        three associations are moderated by the most penetrant AD genetic risk        [Apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε4+ allele]. Third, we test whether a non-APOE AD        genetic risk score further moderates these APOE × multimodal risk score        associations. Methods: We assembled a longitudinal data set (spanning a 40-year        band of aging, 53-95 years) with non-demented older adults (baseline n = 602;        Mage = 70.63(8.70) years; 66% female) from the Victoria Longitudinal Study (VLS).        The measures included for each modifiable risk score were: (1) functional-health        [pulse pressure (PP), grip strength, and body mass index], (2) lifestyle-reserve        (physical, social, cognitive-integrative, cognitive-novel activities, and        education), and (3) the combination of functional-health and lifestyle-reserve        risk scores. Two AD genetic risk markers included (1) APOE and (2) a combined        AD-genetic risk score (AD-GRS) comprised of three single nucleotide polymorphisms        (SNPs; Clusterin[rs11136000], Complement receptor 1[rs6656401],        Phosphatidylinositol binding clathrin assembly protein[rs3851179]). The analytics        included confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), longitudinal invariance testing, and        latent growth curve modeling. Structural path analyses were deployed to test and        compare prediction models for EF performance and change. Results: First, separate        analyses showed that higher functional-health risk scores, lifestyle-reserve risk        scores, and the combined score, predicted poorer EF performance and steeper        decline. Second, APOE and AD-GRS moderated the association between        functional-health risk score and the combined risk score, on EF performance and        change. Specifically, only older adults in the APOEε4- group showed steeper EF        decline with high risk scores on both functional-health and combined risk score.        Both associations were further magnified for adults with high AD-GRS. Conclusion:        The present multimodal AD risk network approach incorporated both modifiable and        genetic risk scores to predict EF trajectories.

10.1186/s12883-021-02407-1,Cell type-specific potential pathogenic genes and functional pathways in Alzheimer’s Disease,2021.0,"BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a pervasive age-related and highly        heritable neurodegenerative disorder but has no effective therapy. The complex        cellular microenvironment in the AD brain impedes our understanding of        pathogenesis. Thus, a comprehensive investigation of cell type-specific responses        in AD is crucial to provide precise molecular and cellular targets for        therapeutic development. METHODS: Here, we integrated analyzed 4,441        differentially expressed genes (DEGs) that were identified from 263,370        single-cells in cortex samples by single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq)        between 42 AD-pathology subjects and 39 normal controls within 3 studies. DEGs        were analyzed in microglia, astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, excitatory neurons,        inhibitory neurons, and endothelial cells, respectively. In each cell type, we        identified both common DEGs which were observed in all 3 studies, and overlapping        DEGs which have been seen in at least 2 studies. Firstly, we showed the common        DEGs expression and explained the biological functions by comparing with existing        literature or multil-omics signaling pathways knowledgebase. We then determined        the significant modules and hub genes, and explored the biological processes        using the overlapping DEGs. Finally, we identified the common and distinct        dysregulated pathways using overall DEGs and overlapping DEGs in a cell        type-specific manner. RESULTS: Up-regulated LINGO1 has been seen in both        oligodendrocytes and excitatory neurons across 3 studies. Interestingly, genes        enriched in the mitochondrial module were up-regulated across all cell types,        which indicates mitochondrial dysfunction in the AD brain.

It has been        suggested that NLK is part of a neuroprotective response to amyloid β-induced        cell death. The aim of our study was to investigate the value of cerebrospinal        fluid (CSF) NLK levels as a biomarker of vascular amyloid deposition in patients        with cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) and in patients with amnestic mild        cognitive impairment (aMCI) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). METHODS: CSF NLK levels        were quantified by ELISA in CAA patients (n = 25) and controls (n = 27) and in        two independent samples of aMCI patients, AD patients, and controls: (1) From the        Radboud University Medical Center (Nijmegen), we included n = 19 aMCI patients, n        = 40 AD patients, and n = 32 controls. (2) From the Hospital of Sant Pau        (Barcelona), we included n = 33 aMCI patients, n = 17 AD patients, and n = 50        controls. RESULTS: CSF NLK levels were similar in CAA patients and controls (p =        0.95). However, we found an elevated CSF concentration of NLK in aMCI (p <        0.0001) and AD patients (p < 0.0001) compared to controls in both samples sets.        In addition, we found a correlation of CSF NLK with CSF YKL-40        (age-adjusted-spearman-rank-coefficient = 0.82, p < 0.0001) in aMCI/AD patients,        a well-known glial marker of neuro-inflammation. CONCLUSIONS: We found that CSF        NLK levels are elevated in aMCI and AD patients compared to controls, but are not        increased in CAA patients.

Therefore, identifying periphery biomarkers correlated with mild        cognitive impairment (MCI) is of importance for early diagnosis of AD. Here, we        performed platelet proteomics in T2DM patients with MCI (T2DM-MCI) and without        MCI (T2DM-nMCI). Pearson analysis of the omics data with MMSE (mini-mental state        examination), Aβ1-42/Aβ1-40 (β-amyloid), and rGSK-3β(T/S9) (total to        Serine-9-phosphorylated glycogen synthase kinase-3β) revealed that        mitophagy/autophagy-, insulin signaling-, and glycolysis/gluconeogenesis        pathways-related proteins were most significantly involved. Among them, only the        increase of optineurin, an autophagy-related protein, was simultaneously        correlated with the reduced MMSE score, and the increased Aβ1-42/Aβ1-40 and        rGSK-3β(T/S9), and the optineurin alone could discriminate T2DM-MCI from        T2DM-nMCI.

10.1186/s13024-021-00488-7,Adult-onset CNS myelin sulfatide deficiency is sufficient to cause Alzheimer’s disease-like neuroinflammation and cognitive impairment,2021.0,"BACKGROUND: Human genetic association studies point to immune response and lipid        metabolism, in addition to amyloid-beta (Aβ) and tau, as major pathways in        Alzheimer's disease (AD) etiology. Accumulating evidence suggests that chronic        neuroinflammation, mainly mediated by microglia and astrocytes, plays a causative        role in neurodegeneration in AD. Our group and others have reported early and        dramatic losses of brain sulfatide in AD cases and animal models that are        mediated by ApoE in an isoform-dependent manner and accelerated by Aβ        accumulation. To date, it remains unclear if changes in specific brain lipids are        sufficient to drive AD-related pathology. METHODS: To study the consequences of        CNS sulfatide deficiency and gain insights into the underlying mechanisms, we        developed a novel mouse model of adult-onset myelin sulfatide deficiency, i.e.,        tamoxifen-inducible myelinating glia-specific cerebroside sulfotransferase (CST)        conditional knockout mice (CST(fl/fl)/Plp1-CreERT), took advantage of        constitutive CST knockout mice (CST(-/-)), and generated CST/ApoE double knockout        mice (CST(-/-)/ApoE(-/-)), and assessed these mice using a broad range of        methodologies including lipidomics, RNA profiling, behavioral testing,        PLX3397-mediated microglia depletion, mass spectrometry (MS) imaging,        immunofluorescence, electron microscopy, and Western blot. RESULTS: We found that        mild central nervous system (CNS) sulfatide losses within myelinating cells are        sufficient to activate disease-associated microglia and astrocytes, and to        increase the expression of AD risk genes (e.g., Apoe, Trem2, Cd33, and Mmp12), as        well as previously established causal regulators of the immune/microglia network        in late-onset AD (e.g., Tyrobp, Dock, and Fcerg1), leading to chronic AD-like        neuroinflammation and mild cognitive impairment. Notably, neuroinflammation and        mild cognitive impairment showed gender differences, being more pronounced in        females than males. Subsequent mechanistic studies demonstrated that although CNS        sulfatide losses led to ApoE upregulation, genetically-induced myelin sulfatide        deficiency led to neuroinflammation independently of ApoE. These results,        together with our previous studies (sulfatide deficiency in the context of AD is        mediated by ApoE and accelerated by Aβ accumulation) placed both Aβ and ApoE        upstream of sulfatide deficiency-induced neuroinflammation, and suggested a        positive feedback loop where sulfatide losses may be amplified by increased ApoE        expression. We also demonstrated that CNS sulfatide deficiency-induced        astrogliosis and ApoE upregulation are not secondary to microgliosis, and that        astrogliosis and microgliosis seem to be driven by activation of STAT3 and        PU.1/Spi1 transcription factors, respectively. CONCLUSION: Our results strongly        suggest that sulfatide deficiency is an important contributor and driver of        neuroinflammation and mild cognitive impairment in AD pathology.",d28bf8a051ee5edeb85cbbb942d9d6aafc699eca,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/d28bf8a051ee5edeb85cbbb942d9d6aafc699eca,34526055,PMC8442347,,False,Molecular neurodegeneration,101266600

Clinical research and genome-wide association studies have suggested a        potential contribution of the endocytic pathway to AD, with an emphasis on common        loci. However, the contribution of rare variants in this pathway to AD has not        been thoroughly investigated. In this study, we focused on the effect of rare        variants on AD by first applying a rare-variant gene-set burden analysis using        genes in the endocytic pathway on over 3,000 individuals with European ancestry        from three large whole-genome sequencing (WGS) studies. We identified significant        associations of rare-variant burden within the endocytic pathway with AD, which        were successfully replicated in independent datasets. We further demonstrated        that this endocytic rare-variant enrichment is associated with neurofibrillary        tangles (NFTs) and age-related phenotypes, increasing the risk of obtaining        severer brain damage, earlier age-at-onset, and earlier age-of-death. Next, by        aggregating rare variants within each gene, we sought to identify single        endocytic genes associated with AD and NFTs. Careful examination using NFTs        revealed one significantly associated gene, ANKRD13D. To identify functional        associations, we integrated bulk RNA-Seq data from over 600 brain tissues and        found two endocytic expression genes (eGenes), HLA-A and SLC26A7, that displayed        significant influences on their gene expressions. Differential expressions        between AD patients and controls of these three identified genes were further        examined by incorporating scRNA-Seq data from 48 post-mortem brain samples and        demonstrated distinct expression patterns across cell types. Taken together, our        results demonstrated strong rare-variant effect in the endocytic pathway on AD        risk and progression and functional effect of gene expression alteration in both        bulk and single-cell resolution, which may bring more insight and serve as        valuable resources for future AD genetic studies, clinical research, and        therapeutic targeting.",19c37f77893352f093e655302c6844b796cd54b3,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/19c37f77893352f093e655302c6844b796cd54b3,34516545,PMC8460036,background,False,PLoS genetics,101239074

Among them, CD2AP encodes        CD2-associated protein, a scaffold protein implicated in dynamic actin remodeling        and membrane trafficking during endocytosis and cytokinesis. Although a clear        link between CD2AP defects and glomerular pathology has been described, little is        known about the function of CD2AP in the brain. The aim of this study was to        analyze the distribution of CD2AP in the AD brain and its potential associations        with tau aggregation and β-amyloid (Aβ) deposition. First, we performed        immunohistochemical analysis of CD2AP expression in brain tissue from AD patients        and controls (N = 60). Our results showed granular CD2AP immunoreactivity in the        human brain endothelium in all samples. In AD cases, no CD2AP was found to be        associated with Aβ deposits in vessels or parenchymal plaques. CD2AP neuronal        inclusions similar to neurofibrillary tangles (NFT) and neuropil thread-like        deposits were found only in AD samples. Moreover, immunofluorescence analysis        revealed that CD2AP colocalized with pTau. Regarding CD2AP neuronal distribution,        a hierarchical progression from the entorhinal to the temporal and occipital        cortex was detected. We found that CD2AP immunodetection in neurons was strongly        and positively associated with Braak neurofibrillary stage, independent of age        and other pathological hallmarks. To further investigate the association between        pTau and CD2AP, we included samples from cases of primary tauopathies        (corticobasal degeneration [CBD], progressive supranuclear palsy [PSP], and        Pick's disease [PiD]) in our study. Among these cases, CD2AP positivity was only        found in PiD samples as neurofibrillary tangle-like and Pick body-like deposits,        whereas no neuronal CD2AP deposits were detected in PSP or CBD samples, which        suggested an association of CD2AP neuronal expression with 3R-Tau-diseases.

Whilst the clinical diagnosis of AD patients is a loss of working        memory and long-term declarative memory, the histological diagnosis is the        presence of neurofibrillary tangles of hyperphosphorylated Tau and Amyloid-beta        plaques. Tau pathology spreads through synaptically connected neurons to impair        synaptic function preceding the formation of neurofibrillary tangles, synaptic        loss, axonal retraction and cell death. Alongside synaptic pathology, recent data        suggest that Tau has physiological roles in the pre- or post- synaptic        compartments. Thus, we have seen a shift in the research focus from Tau as a        microtubule-stabilising protein in axons, to Tau as a synaptic protein with roles        in accelerating spine formation, dendritic elongation, and in synaptic plasticity        coordinating memory pathways.

Previous studies        have investigated the performance of PRS in the prediction of disease progression        to AD by including and excluding single nucleotide polymorphisms within the        region surrounding the APOE gene. These studies may have missed the APOE        genotype-specific predictability of PRS for disease progression to AD. METHODS:        We analyzed 732 MCI from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative cohort,        including those who progressed to AD within 5 years post-baseline (n = 270) and        remained stable as MCI (n = 462). The predictability of PRS including and        excluding the APOE region (PRS(+APOE) and PRS(-APOE)) on the conversion to AD and        its interaction with the APOE ε4 carrier status were assessed using Cox        regression analyses. RESULTS: PRS(+APOE) (hazard ratio [HR] 1.468, 95% CI        1.335-1.615) and PRS(-APOE) (HR 1.293, 95% CI 1.157-1.445) were both associated        with a significantly increased risk of MCI progression to dementia. The        interaction between PRS(+APOE) and APOE ε4 carrier status was significant with a        P-value of 0.0378.

10.1007/s12031-021-01824-8,Investigation of the Molecular Role of Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor in Alzheimer’s Disease,2021.0,"Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), or abrineurin, is a member of the        neurotrophin family of growth factors that acts on both the central and        peripheral nervous systems. BDNF is also well known for its cardinal role in        normal neural maturation. It binds to at least two receptors at the cell surface        known as tyrosine kinase B (TrkB) and p75(NTR). Additional neurotrophins that are        anatomically linked with BDNF include neurotrophin-3 (NT-3), neurotrophin-4        (NT-4), and nerve growth factor (NGF). It is evident that BDNF levels in patients        with Alzheimer's disease (AD) are altered. AD is a progressive disorder and a        form of dementia, where the mental function of an elderly person is disrupted. It        is associated with a progressive decline in cognitive function, which mainly        targets the thinking, memory, and behavior of the person. The degeneration of        neurons occurs in the cerebral cortex region of brain. The two major sources        responsible for neuronal degeneration are protein fragment amyloid-beta (Aβ),        which builds up in the spaces between the nerve cells, known as plaques,        disrupting the neuron signaling pathway and leading to dementia, and        neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), which are the twisted fibers of proteins that        build up inside the cells. AD is highly prevalent, with recent data indicating        nearly 5.8 million Americans aged 65 and older with AD in 2020, and with 80% of        patients 75 and older. AD is recognized as the sixth leading cause of death in        the USA, and its prevalence is predicted to increase exponentially in the coming        years. As AD worsens over time, it becomes increasingly important to understand        the exact pathophysiology, biomarkers, and treatment. In this article, we focus        primarily on the controversial aspect of BDNF in AD, including its influence on        various other proteins and enzymes and the current treatments associated with        BDNF, along with future perspectives.",a45ac9f18ffad056f1782b1e35fc22b00a8510cc,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/a45ac9f18ffad056f1782b1e35fc22b00a8510cc,34424488,,,False,Journal of molecular neuroscience : MN,9002991
10.1016/S1474-4422(21)00139-3,Comparison of CSF biomarkers in Down syndrome and autosomal dominant Alzheimer's disease: a cross-sectional study,2021.0,"BACKGROUND: Due to trisomy of chromosome 21 and the resultant extra copy of the        amyloid precursor protein gene, nearly all adults with Down syndrome develop        Alzheimer's disease pathology by the age of 40 years and are at high risk for        dementia given their increased life expectancy compared with adults with Down        syndrome in the past. We aimed to compare CSF biomarker patterns in Down syndrome        with those of carriers of autosomal dominant Alzheimer's disease mutations to        enhance our understanding of disease mechanisms in these two genetic groups at        high risk for Alzheimer's disease. METHODS: We did a cross-sectional study using        data from adults enrolled in the Alzheimer's Biomarker Consortium-Down Syndrome        (ABC-DS) study, a multisite longitudinal study of Alzheimer's disease in Down        syndrome, as well as a cohort of carriers of autosomal dominant Alzheimer's        disease mutations and non-carrier sibling controls enrolled in the Dominantly        Inherited Alzheimer Network (DIAN) study. For ABC-DS, participants with baseline        CSF, available clinical diagnosis, and apolipoprotein E genotype as of Jan 31,        2019, were included in the analysis. DIAN participants with baseline CSF,        available clinical diagnosis, and apolipoprotein E genotype as of June 30, 2018,        were evaluated as comparator groups. CSF samples obtained from adults with Down        syndrome, similarly aged carriers of autosomal dominant Alzheimer's disease        mutations, and non-carrier siblings (aged 30-61 years) were analysed for markers        of amyloid β (Aβ(1-40), Aβ(1-42)); tau phosphorylated at threonine 181-related        processes; neuronal, axonal, or synaptic injury (total tau, visinin-like protein        1, neurofilament light chain [NfL], synaptosomal-associated protein 25); and        astrogliosis and neuroinflammation (chitinase-3-like protein 1 [YKL-40]) via        immunoassay. Biomarker concentrations were compared as a function of dementia        status (asymptomatic or symptomatic), and linear regression was used to evaluate        and compare the relationship between biomarker concentrations and age among        groups. FINDINGS: We assessed CSF samples from 341 individuals (178 [52%] women,        163 [48%] men, aged 30-61 years). Participants were adults with Down syndrome        (n=41), similarly aged carriers of autosomal dominant Alzheimer's disease        mutations (n=192), and non-carrier siblings (n=108). Individuals with Down        syndrome had patterns of Alzheimer's disease-related CSF biomarkers remarkably        similar to carriers of autosomal dominant Alzheimer's disease mutations,        including reductions (all p<0·0080) in Aβ(1-42) to Aβ(1-40) ratio and increases        in markers of phosphorylated tau-related processes; neuronal, axonal, and        synaptic injury (p<0·080); and astrogliosis and neuroinflammation, with greater        degrees of abnormality in individuals with dementia. Differences included overall        higher concentrations of Aβ and YKL-40 (both p<0·0008) in Down syndrome and        potential elevations in CSF tau (p<0·010) and NfL (p<0·0001) in the asymptomatic        stage (ie, no dementia symptoms).

10.1186/s13024-021-00473-0,Plaque-associated human microglia accumulate lipid droplets in a chimeric model of Alzheimer’s disease,2021.0,"BACKGROUND: Disease-associated microglia (DAMs), that surround beta-amyloid        plaques, represent a transcriptionally-distinct microglial profile in Alzheimer's        disease (AD). Activation of DAMs is dependent on triggering receptor expressed on        myeloid cells 2 (TREM2) in mouse models and the AD TREM2-R47H risk variant        reduces microglial activation and plaque association in human carriers.        Interestingly, TREM2 has also been identified as a microglial lipid-sensor, and        recent data indicates lipid droplet accumulation in aged microglia, that is in        turn associated with a dysfunctional proinflammatory phenotype. However, whether        lipid droplets (LDs) are present in human microglia in AD and how the R47H        mutation affects this remains unknown. METHODS: To determine the impact of the        TREM2 R47H mutation on human microglial function in vivo, we transplanted        wild-type and isogenic TREM2-R47H iPSC-derived microglial progenitors into our        recently developed chimeric Alzheimer mouse model. At 7 months of age scRNA-seq        and histological analyses were performed. RESULTS: Here we report that the        transcriptome of human wild-type TREM2 and isogenic TREM2-R47H DAM xenografted        microglia (xMGs), isolated from chimeric AD mice, closely resembles that of human        atherosclerotic foam cells. In addition, much like foam cells, plaque-bound xMGs        are highly enriched in lipid droplets. Somewhat surprisingly and in contrast to a        recent in vitro study, TREM2-R47H mutant xMGs exhibit an overall reduction in the        accumulation of lipid droplets in vivo. Notably, TREM2-R47H xMGs also show        overall reduced reactivity to plaques, including diminished plaque-proximity,        reduced CD9 expression, and lower secretion of plaque-associated APOE.        CONCLUSIONS: Altogether, these results indicate lipid droplet accumulation occurs        in human DAM xMGs in AD, but is reduced in TREM2-R47H DAM xMGs, as it occurs        secondary to TREM2-mediated changes in plaque proximity and reactivity.",30143e52929aff31ee5759b771934bd869e6b3ed,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/30143e52929aff31ee5759b771934bd869e6b3ed,34301296,PMC8305935,background,False,Molecular neurodegeneration,101266600

Multiple amyloid associated proteins with still controversial role in        amyloidogenesis colocalize with the structurally different amyloid peptides ABri        in FBD, ADan in FDD, and Aβ in AD. Genetic variants and plasma levels of one of        these associated proteins, clusterin, have been identified as risk factors for        AD. Clusterin is known to bind soluble Aβ in biological fluids, facilitate its        brain clearance, and prevent its aggregation. The current work identifies        clusterin as the major ABri- and ADan-binding protein and provides insight into        the biochemical mechanisms leading to the association of clusterin with ABri and        ADan deposits. Mirroring findings in AD, the studies corroborate clusterin        co-localization with cerebral parenchymal and vascular amyloid deposits in both        disorders. Ligand affinity chromatography with downstream Western blot and amino        acid sequence analyses unequivocally identified clusterin as the major ABri- and        ADan-binding plasma protein. ELISA highlighted a specific saturable binding of        clusterin to ABri and ADan with low nanomolar Kd values within the same range as        those previously demonstrated for the clusterin-Aβ interaction. Consistent with        its chaperone activity, thioflavin T binding assays clearly showed a modulatory        effect of clusterin on ABri and ADan aggregation/fibrillization properties. Our        findings, together with the known multifunctional activity of clusterin and its        modulatory activity on the complex cellular pathways leading to oxidative stress,        mitochondrial dysfunction, and the induction of cell death mechanisms - all known        pathogenic features of these protein folding disorders - suggests the likelihood        of a more complex role and a translational potential for the apolipoprotein in        the amelioration/prevention of these pathogenic mechanisms.",b4b3c1f9018816e23e721fe2ecfe9eaa4ccc5434,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/b4b3c1f9018816e23e721fe2ecfe9eaa4ccc5434,34298087,PMC8440498,background,False,Neurobiology of disease,9500169

We investigate shared underlying genetic associations using results from        recent large genome-wide association studies (GWAS) on adult hearing difficulty        and AD. Genetic correlation and Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis do not        support a genetic correlation between the disorders, but suggest a direct causal        link from AD genetic risk to hearing difficulty, driven by APOE. Systematic MR        analyses on the effect of other traits revealed shared effects of glutamine,        gamma-glutamylglutamine, and citrate levels on reduced risk of both hearing        difficulty and AD. In addition, pathway analysis on GWAS risk variants suggests        shared function in neuronal signalling pathways as well as etiology of diabetes        and cardiovascular disease. However, after multiple testing corrections, neither        analysis led to statistically significant associations.

The        current treatment for early AD is acetylcholine esterase inhibitors (AChEIs);        however, the efficacy is poor. Besides, AChEI did not show efficacy in mild        cognitive impairment (MCI). Beta-amyloid (A) deposits have been regarded to be        highly related to the pathogenesis of AD. However, many clinical trials aiming at        the clearance of A deposits failed to improve the cognitive decline of AD, even        at its early phase. There should be other important mechanisms unproven in the        course of AD and MCI. Feasible biomarkers for the diagnosis and treatment        response of AD are lacking to date. The N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR)        activation plays an important role in learning and memory. On the other hand,        oxidative stress has been regarded to contribute to aging with the assumption        that free radicals damage cell constituents and connective tissues. Our recent        study found that an NMDAR enhancer, sodium benzoate (the pivotal inhibitor of        D-amino acid oxidase [DAAO]), improved the cognitive and global function of        patients with early-phase AD. Further, we found that peripheral DAAO levels were        higher in patients with MCI and AD than healthy controls.

Presently, the underlying        pathogenic genes of AD patients remain elusive, and effective disease-modifying        therapy is not available. This study explored novel biomarkers that can affect        diagnosis and treatment in AD based on immune infiltration. METHODS: The gene        expression profiles of 139 AD cases and 134 normal controls were obtained from        the NCBI GEO public database. We applied the computational method CIBERSORT to        bulk gene expression profiles of AD to quantify 22 subsets of immune cells.        Besides, based on the use of the Least Absolute Shrinkage Selection Operator        (LASSO), this study also applied SVM-RFE analysis to screen key genes. GO-based        semantic similarity and logistic regression model analyses were applied to        explore hub genes further. RESULTS: There was a remarkable significance in the        infiltration of immune cells between the subgroups. The proportions for        monocytes, M0 macrophages, and dendritic cells in the AD group were significantly        higher than those in the normal group, while the proportion of some cells was        lower than that of the normal group, such as NK cell resting, T-cell CD4 naive,        T-cell CD4 memory activation, and eosinophils. Additionally, seven genes (ABCA2,        CREBRF, CD72, CETN2, KCNG1, NDUFA2, and RPL36AL) were identified as hub genes.        Then we performed the analysis of immune factor correlation, gene set enrichment        analysis (GSEA), and GO based on seven hub genes.

These genes either encode or signal        through immunomodulatory tyrosine-phosphorylated inhibitory motifs (ITIMs) or        activation motifs (ITAMs) and govern processes critical to AD pathology, such as        inflammation and amyloid phagocytosis. To investigate whether additional ITIM and        ITAM-containing family members may contribute to AD risk and be overlooked due to        the stringent multiple testing in GWAS, we combined protein quantitative trait        loci (pQTL) data from a recent plasma proteomics study with AD associations in a        recent GWAS. We found that pQTLs for genes encoding ITIM/ITAM family members were        more frequently associated with AD than those for non-ITIM/ITAM genes. Further        testing of one family member, SIGLEC14 which encodes an ITAM, uncovered        substantial copy number variations, identified an SNP as a proxy for gene        deletion, and found that gene expression correlates significantly with gene        deletion. We also found that SIGLEC14 deletion increases the expression of        SIGLEC5, an ITIM. We conclude that many genes in this ITIM/ITAM family likely        impact AD risk, and that complex genetics including copy number variation,        opposing function of encoded proteins, and coupled gene expression may mask these        AD risk associations at the genome-wide level.",051701534d44ae3e070f74cc8ec1c51533c0b961,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/051701534d44ae3e070f74cc8ec1c51533c0b961,34208838,PMC8303736,,False,Genes,101551097

Most        sensorineural hearing loss is caused by the loss of mechanosensitive hair cells        in the cochlea, often due to aging, noise, and ototoxic drugs. The identification        of genes that can be targeted to slow aging and reduce the vulnerability of hair        cells to insults is critical for the prevention of sensorineural hearing loss.        Our previous cell-specific transcriptome analysis of adult cochlear hair cells        and supporting cells showed that Clu, encoding a secreted chaperone that is        involved in several basic biological events, such as cell death, tumor        progression, and neurodegenerative disorders, is expressed in hair cells and        supporting cells. We generated Clu-null mice (C57BL/6) to investigate its role in        the organ of Corti, the sensory epithelium responsible for hearing in the        mammalian cochlea. We showed that the deletion of Clu did not affect the        development of hair cells and supporting cells; hair cells and supporting cells        appeared normal at 1 month of age. Auditory function tests showed that Clu-null        mice had hearing thresholds comparable to those of wild-type littermates before 3        months of age. Interestingly, Clu-null mice displayed less hair cell and hearing        loss compared to their wildtype littermates after 3 months. Furthermore, the        deletion of Clu is protected against aminoglycoside-induced hair cell loss in        both in vivo and in vitro models.

We demonstrated that        GSAP physically interacts with the Fe65-APP complex to regulate APP        trafficking/partitioning. GSAP is enriched in the mitochondria-associated        membrane (MAM) and regulates lipid homeostasis through the amyloidogenic        processing of APP. GSAP deletion generates a lipid environment unfavorable for AD        pathogenesis, leading to improved mitochondrial function and the rescue of        cognitive deficits in an AD mouse model. Finally, we identified a novel GSAP        single-nucleotide polymorphism that regulates its brain transcript level and is        associated with an increased AD risk.

Analysis of isogenic SORL1 wild-type, heterozygous,        and homozygous null neurons demonstrates that, whereas SORL1 haploinsufficiency        results in endosome dysfunction, complete loss of SORL1 leads to additional        defects in lysosome function and autophagy. Neuronal endolysosomal dysfunction        caused by loss of SORL1 is relieved by extracellular antisense        oligonucleotide-mediated reduction of APP protein, demonstrating that PSEN1, APP,        and SORL1 act in a common pathway regulating the endolysosome system, which        becomes dysfunctional in AD.",5d753131a1d567a3f64835d95e8d71b3c448bae4,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/5d753131a1d567a3f64835d95e8d71b3c448bae4,34133918,PMC8220253,background,False,Cell reports,101573691

Although there have        been numerous clinical trials for these diseases, they have been unsuccessful.        Research conducted over the past three decades by a large number of laboratories        has demonstrated that abnormal actions of common kinases play a key role in the        pathogenesis of both AD and HD as well as several other neurodegenerative        diseases. Prominent among these kinases are glycogen synthase kinase (GSK3), p38        mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and some of the cyclin-dependent kinases        (CDKs). After a brief summary of the molecular and cell biology of AD and HD this        review covers what is known about the role of these three groups of kinases in        the brain and in the pathogenesis of the two neurodegenerative disorders. The        potential of targeting GSK3, p38 MAPK and CDKS as effective therapeutics is also        discussed as is a brief discussion on the utilization of recently developed drugs        that simultaneously target two or all three of these groups of kinases.        Multi-kinase inhibitors either by themselves or in combination with strategies        currently being used such as immunotherapy or secretase inhibitors for AD and        knockdown for HD could represent a more effective therapeutic approach for these        fatal neurodegenerative diseases.",c9efe395e7962da76b46b798f9e3af315988e103,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/c9efe395e7962da76b46b798f9e3af315988e103,34072862,PMC8199025,,False,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791

Ten percent of individuals over 65 years have AD and its prevalence        continues to rise with increasing age. There are currently no effective disease        modifying treatments for AD, resulting in increasingly large socioeconomic and        personal costs. Increasing age is associated with an increase in low-grade        chronic inflammation (inflammaging) that may contribute to the neurodegenerative        process in AD. Although the exact mechanisms remain unclear, aberrant elevation        of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (RONS) levels from several endogenous and        exogenous processes in the brain may not only affect cell signaling, but also        trigger cellular senescence, inflammation, and pyroptosis.

However, the        underlying molecular mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here, we identified        Amphiphysin I mediates both tau phosphorylation and synaptic dysfunction in AD.        Amphiphysin I is cleaved by a cysteine proteinase asparagine endopeptidase (AEP)        at N278 in the brains of AD patients. The amount of AEP-generated N-terminal        fragment of Amphiphysin I (1-278) is increased with aging. Amphiphysin I (1-278)        inhibits clathrin-mediated endocytosis and induces synaptic dysfunction.        Furthermore, Amphiphysin I (1-278) binds p35 and promotes its transition to p25,        thus activates CDK5 and enhances tau hyperphosphorylation.

Polygenic        overlap analysis was used to estimate shared and trait-specific causal variants        across a pair of traits. Causal relationships between PTSD and the depressive        phenotypes were investigated using Mendelian randomization. Shared genomic loci        between PTSD and MDD were identified using cross-trait        meta-analysis.RESULTSGenetic correlations of PTSD with the depressive phenotypes        were in the range of 0.71-0.80. The estimated numbers of causal variants were        14,565, 12,965, 10,565, and 4,986 for MDD, DEP, DAF, and PTSD, respectively. In        each case, causal variants contributing to PTSD were completely or largely        covered by causal variants defining each of the depressive phenotypes. Mendelian        randomization analysis indicated that the genetically determined depressive        phenotypes confer a causal effect on PTSD (b = 0.21-0.31). Notably, genetically        determined PTSD confers a causal effect on DEP (b = 0.14) and DAF (b = 0.15), but        not MDD.

It is hypothesized that reducing the        uptake of tau seeds and subsequent induction of tau aggregation could be a        potential approach for abrogating disease progression in AD. Here, we studied to        what extent different endosomal routes play a role in the neuronal uptake of        preformed tau seeds. Using pharmacological and genetic tools, we identified        dynamin-1, actin, and Rac1 as key players. Furthermore, inhibition of PIKfyve, a        protein downstream of Rac1, reduced both the trafficking of tau seeds into        lysosomes and the induction of tau aggregation.

However, no effective drug        treatment for a full-blown disease has been developed to date. The genetic        background of AD is extensively studied; numerous genome-wide association studies        (GWAS) identified significant genes associated with increased risk of AD        development. This review summarizes more than 100 risk loci. Many of them may        serve as biomarkers of AD progression, even in the preclinical stage of the        disease. Furthermore, we used GWAS data to identify key pathways of AD        pathogenesis: cellular processes, metabolic processes, biological regulation,        localization, transport, regulation of cellular processes, and neurological        system processes.

Later, it was found that MsrB1 is        homologous to PilB in Neisseria gonorrhoeae, which is a methionine sulfoxide        reductase (Msr), specifically reducing L-methionine sulfoxide (L-Met-O) in        proteins. In humans and mice, four members constitute the Msr family, which are        MsrA, MsrB1, MsrB2, and MsrB3. MsrA can reduce free or protein-containing L-Met-O        (S), whereas MsrBs can only function on the L-Met-O (R) epimer in proteins.        Though there are isomerases existent that could transfer L-Met-O (S) to L-Met-O        (R) and vice-versa, the loss of Msr individually results in different phenotypes        in mice models. These observations indicate that the function of one Msr cannot        be totally complemented by another. Among the mammalian Msrs, MsrB1 is the only        selenocysteine-containing protein, and we recently found that loss of MsrB1        perturbs the synaptic plasticity in mice, along with the astrogliosis in their        brains. In this review, we summarized the effects resulting from Msr deficiency        and the bioactivity of selenium in the central nervous system, especially those        that we learned from the MsrB1 knockout mouse model.

Genome-wide association studies recently highlighted a prominent        role for microglia in late-onset AD (LOAD). Specifically, inositol        polyphosphate-5-phosphatase (INPP5D), also known as SHIP1, is selectively        expressed in brain microglia and has been reported to be associated with LOAD.        Although INPP5D is likely a crucial player in AD pathophysiology, its role in        disease onset and progression remains unclear. We performed differential gene        expression analysis to investigate INPP5D expression in AD and its association        with plaque density and microglial markers using transcriptomic (RNA-Seq) data        from the Accelerating Medicines Partnership for Alzheimer's Disease (AMP-AD)        cohort. We also performed quantitative real-time PCR, immunoblotting, and        immunofluorescence assays to assess INPP5D expression in the 5xFAD amyloid mouse        model. Differential gene expression analysis found that INPP5D expression was        upregulated in LOAD and positively correlated with amyloid plaque density. In        addition, in 5xFAD mice, Inpp5d expression increased as the disease progressed,        and selectively in plaque-associated microglia. Increased Inpp5d expression        levels in 5xFAD mice were abolished entirely by depleting microglia with the        colony-stimulating factor receptor-1 antagonist PLX5622. Our findings show that        INPP5D expression increases as AD progresses, predominantly in plaque-associated        microglia.

MicroRNAs        (miRNAs) have been extensively studied in many diseases, including AD. To        identify differentially expressed miRNAs (DEmiRNAs) and genes specific to AD, we        used bioinformatic analyses to investigate candidate miRNA-mRNA pairs involved in        the pathogenesis of AD. We focused on differentially expressed genes (DEGs) that        are targets of DEmiRNAs. The GEO2R tool and the HISAT2-DESeq2 software were used        to identify DEmiRNAs and DEGs. Bioinformatic tools available online, such as TAM        and the Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery (DAVID),        were used to perform functional annotation and enrichment analysis. Targets of        miRNAs were predicted using the miRTarBase. The Search Tool for the Retrieval of        Interacting Genes (STRING) and Cytoscape, which are available online, were        utilized to construct protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks and identify hub        genes.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) risk is associated with the TREM2(R47H)        variant, which impairs ligand binding and consequently microglia responses to Aβ        pathology. Here, we show that TREM2 engagement by the mAb hT2AB as surrogate        ligand activates microglia in 5XFAD transgenic mice that accumulate Aβ and        express either the common TREM2 variant (TREM2(CV)) or TREM2(R47H) scRNA-seq of        microglia from TREM2(CV)-5XFAD mice treated once with control hIgG1 exposed four        distinct trajectories of microglia activation leading to disease-associated        (DAM), interferon-responsive (IFN-R), cycling (Cyc-M), and MHC-II expressing        (MHC-II) microglia types. All of these were underrepresented in TREM2(R47H)-5XFAD        mice, suggesting that TREM2 ligand engagement is required for microglia        activation trajectories. Moreover, Cyc-M and IFN-R microglia were more abundant        in female than male TREM2(CV)-5XFAD mice, likely due to greater Aβ load in female        5XFAD mice. A single systemic injection of hT2AB replenished Cyc-M, IFN-R, and        MHC-II pools in TREM2(R47H)-5XFAD mice. In TREM2(CV)-5XFAD mice, however, hT2AB        brought the representation of male Cyc-M and IFN-R microglia closer to that of        females, in which these trajectories had already reached maximum capacity.        Moreover, hT2AB induced shifts in gene expression patterns in all microglial        pools without affecting representation. Repeated treatment with a murinized hT2AB        version over 10 d increased chemokines brain content in TREM2(R47H)-5XFAD mice,        consistent with microglia expansion. Thus, the impact of hT2AB on microglia is        shaped by the extent of TREM2 endogenous ligand engagement and basal microglia        activation.",b755d1a9cde35a6b2ff7435a8654bf37b725c382,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/b755d1a9cde35a6b2ff7435a8654bf37b725c382,33446504,PMC7826333,background,False,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876

Neuropathologic hallmarks of AD include neurofibrillary tangles        (NFTs), paired helical filaments, and amyloid plaques. Mutations in the        microtubule-associated protein Tau, a major component of the NFTs, cause its        hyperphosphorylation in AD. We have shown that signaling by the gaseous molecule        hydrogen sulfide (H(2)S) is dysregulated during aging. H(2)S signals via a        posttranslational modification termed sulfhydration/persulfidation, which        participates in diverse cellular processes. Here we show that cystathionine        γ-lyase (CSE), the biosynthetic enzyme for H(2)S, binds wild type Tau, which        enhances its catalytic activity. By contrast, CSE fails to bind Tau P301L, a        mutant that is present in the 3xTg-AD mouse model of AD. We further show that CSE        is depleted in 3xTg-AD mice as well as in human AD brains, and that H(2)S        prevents hyperphosphorylation of Tau by sulfhydrating its kinase, glycogen        synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β).

Here, we describe a detrimental        role of ApoE4 in regulating fatty acid (FA) metabolism across neuron and        astrocyte in tandem with their distinctive mitochondrial phenotypes. ApoE4        disrupts neuronal function by decreasing FA sequestering in lipid droplets (LDs).        FAs in neuronal LDs are exported and internalized by astrocytes, with ApoE4        diminishing the transport efficiency. Further, ApoE4 lowers FA oxidation and        leads to lipid accumulation in both astrocyte and the hippocampus. Importantly,        diminished capacity of ApoE4 astrocytes in eliminating neuronal lipids and        degrading FAs accounts for their compromised metabolic and synaptic support to        neurons.

Protein expression mechanisms are involved        since the early stages. Several studies evaluated epigenomics and proteomics        profiles in these patients, with promising results. In general, they focused on        early, specific, and minimally invasive biomarkers for the diagnosis and        prognosis of AD and PD. OBJECTIVES: This review aimed at summarizing results to        find the most reliable evidence in the field. RESULTS: Among epigenomics studies,        there is a focus on microRNAs (miRNAs) as candidate diagnostic biomarkers for AD        or PD from blood samples like miR-342-3p, miR-107, miR-106a-5p, miR-106b- 5p,        miR-195, and miR-19b. In addition, DNA methylation has been tested in a few        works, obtaining significant differences in some genes (NCAPH2/LMF2 COASY,        SPINT1, BDNFTREM1, TREM2, NPAS2, PDE4D), which could be useful for evaluating the        disease progression as well as potential risk factors. Regarding proteomics, most        of the studies were untargeted and used plasma or serum samples. In general, they        highlighted the importance of coagulation, inflammation pathways, and oxidative        stress. Among targeted studies, some proteins (phosphorylated tau, C reactive        protein (CRP), interleukins, necrosis factors, transferrin, glial fibrillary        acidic protein (GFAP), and neurofilaments) showed different plasma levels in AD        and PD patients in comparison with healthy participants.

The regulation of γ-secretase is intricate and involves the        function of multiple cellular entities. Recently, γ-secretase modulatory proteins        (GSMPs), which are non-essential subunits and yet modulate γ-secretase activity        and specificity, have emerged as an important component in guiding γ-secretase.        GSMPs are responsive to cellular and environmental changes and therefore, provide        another layer of regulation of γ-secretase.

The        pathophysiological drivers and clinical impact of AoO variation in this        population are unknown. We examined brains of 23 patients focusing on generation        and deposition of beta-amyloid (Aβ) and Tau pathology profile. In 14 patients        distributed at the extremes of AoO, we performed whole-exome capture to identify        genotype-phenotype correlations. We also studied kinome activity, proteasome        activity, and protein polyubiquitination in brain tissue, associating it with Tau        phosphorylation profiles. PSEN1-E280A patients showed a bimodal distribution for        AoO. Besides AoO, there were no clinical differences between analyzed groups.        Despite the effect of mutant PSEN1 on production of Aβ, there were no relevant        differences between groups in generation and deposition of Aβ. However,        differences were found in hyperphosphorylated Tau (pTau) pathology, where early        onset patients showed severe pathology with diffuse aggregation pattern        associated with increased activation of stress kinases. In contrast, late-onset        patients showed lesser pTau pathology and a distinctive kinase activity.        Furthermore, we identified new protective genetic variants affecting        ubiquitin-proteasome function in early onset patients, resulting in higher        ubiquitin-dependent degradation of differentially phosphorylated Tau. In        PSEN1-E280A carriers, altered γ-secretase activity and resulting Aβ accumulation        are prerequisites for early AoO. However, Tau hyperphosphorylation pattern, and        its degradation by the proteasome, drastically influences disease onset in        individuals with otherwise similar Aβ pathology, hinting toward a multifactorial        model of disease for FAD. In sporadic AD (SAD), a wide range of heterogeneity,        also influenced by Tau pathology, has been identified.

In the first wave, we explored clinical traits associated with        thirteen genetic variants previously reported to be linked to disease risk using        both the 23andMe and UKB cohorts. We tested 30 additional AD variants in UKB        cohort only in the second wave.

The Trem2 variant R47H, confers        substantially elevated risk of developing late onset Alzheimer's disease, while        NHD-linked Trem2 variants like Y38C, are associated with development of early        onset dementia with white matter pathology. However, it is not known how these        Trem2 species, predisposes individuals to presenile dementia. METHODS: To        investigate if Trem2 Y38C or loss of Trem2 alters neuronal function we generated        a novel mouse model to introduce the NHD Trem2 Y38C variant in murine Trem2 using        CRISPR/Cas9 technology. Trem2(Y38C/Y38C) and Trem2(-/-) mice were assessed for        Trem2 expression, differentially expressed genes, synaptic protein levels and        synaptic plasticity using biochemical, electrophysiological and transcriptomic        approaches. RESULTS: While mice harboring the Trem2 Y38C exhibited normal        expression levels of TREM2, the pathological outcomes phenocopied Trem2(-/-) mice        at 6 months. Transcriptomic analysis revealed altered expression of neuronal and        oligodendrocytes/myelin genes. We observed regional decreases in synaptic protein        levels, with the most affected synapses in the hippocampus. These alterations        were associated with reduced synaptic plasticity. CONCLUSION: Our findings        provide in vivo evidence that Trem2 Y38C disrupts normal TREM2 functions.        Trem2(Y38C/Y38C) and Trem2(-/-) mice demonstrated altered gene expression,        changes in microglia morphology, loss of synaptic proteins and reduced        hippocampal synaptic plasticity at 6 months in absence of any pathological        triggers like amyloid.

It        has been found to affect the disease progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD) by        regulating the neuroinflammatory process. Neuroinflammation has always been        regarded as the mechanism of the development of Parkinson's disease (PD) and        possible therapeutic targets. Therefore, it is worth studying whether EphA1 has a        potential therapeutic value for PD. The purpose of this study is to investigate        the effect of EphA1 in mice and PD cell models and its mechanism.In this study,        we verified the difference in expression of EphA1 and the effect and mechanism of        EphA1 on neuropathological changes through Parkinson's patient samples,        Parkinson's mice model, and Parkinson's model prepared from SH-SY5Y cells in        vitro.EphA1 was highly expressed in the substantia nigra (SN) region of Parkinson        mice and the Parkinson cell model, while the expression of tyrosine hydroxylase        (TH) in the SN region of Parkinson mice was significantly reduced.

10.1002/alz.12185,Targeting increased levels of APP in Down syndrome: Posiphen‐mediated reductions in APP and its products reverse endosomal phenotypes in the Ts65Dn mouse model,2020.0,"OBJECTIVE: Recent clinical trials targeting amyloid beta (Aβ) and tau in        Alzheimer's disease (AD) have yet to demonstrate efficacy. Reviewing the        hypotheses for AD pathogenesis and defining possible links between them may        enhance insights into both upstream initiating events and downstream mechanisms,        thereby promoting discovery of novel treatments. Evidence that in Down syndrome        (DS), a population markedly predisposed to develop early onset AD, increased APP        gene dose is necessary for both AD neuropathology and dementia points to        normalization of the levels of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) and its        products as a route to further define AD pathogenesis and discovering novel        treatments. BACKGROUND: AD and DS share several characteristic manifestations. DS        is caused by trisomy of whole or part of chromosome 21; this chromosome contains        about 233 protein-coding genes, including APP. Recent evidence points to a        defining role for increased expression of the gene for APP and for its 99 amino        acid C-terminal fragment (C99, also known as β-CTF) in dysregulating the        endosomal/lysosomal system. The latter is critical for normal cellular function        and in neurons for transmitting neurotrophic signals. NEW/UPDATED HYPOTHESIS: We        hypothesize that the increase in APP gene dose in DS initiates a process in which        increased levels of full-length APP (fl-APP) and its products, including β-CTF        and possibly Aβ peptides (Aβ42 and Aβ40), drive AD pathogenesis through an        endosome-dependent mechanism(s), which compromises transport of neurotrophic        signals. To test this hypothesis, we carried out studies in the Ts65Dn mouse        model of DS and examined the effects of Posiphen, an orally available small        molecule shown in prior studies to reduce fl-APP. In vitro, Posiphen lowered        fl-APP and its C-terminal fragments, reversed Rab5 hyperactivation and early        endosome enlargement, and restored retrograde transport of neurotrophin        signaling. In vivo, Posiphen treatment (50 mg/kg/d, 26 days, intraperitoneal        [i.p.]) of Ts65Dn mice was well tolerated and demonstrated no adverse effects in        behavior. Treatment resulted in normalization of the levels of fl-APP, C-terminal        fragments and small reductions in Aβ species, restoration to normal levels of        Rab5 activity, reduced phosphorylated tau (p-tau), and reversed deficits in TrkB        (tropomyosin receptor kinase B) activation and in the Akt (protein kinase B        [PKB]), ERK (extracellular signal-regulated kinase), and CREB (cAMP response        element-binding protein) signaling pathways. Remarkably, Posiphen treatment also        restored the level of choline acetyltransferase protein to 2N levels. These        findings support the APP gene dose hypothesis, point to the need for additional        studies to explore the mechanisms by which increased APP gene expression acts to        increase the risk for AD in DS, and to possible utility of treatments to        normalize the levels of APP and its products for preventing AD in those with DS.        MAJOR CHALLENGES FOR THE HYPOTHESIS: Important unanswered questions are: (1) When        should one intervene in those with DS; (2) would an APP-based strategy have        untoward consequences on possible adaptive changes induced by chronically        increased APP gene dose; (3) do other genes present on chromosome 21, or on other        chromosomes whose expression is dysregulated in DS, contribute to AD        pathogenesis; and (4) can one model strategies that combine the use of an        APP-based treatment with those directed at other AD phenotypes including p-tau        and inflammation. LINKAGE TO OTHER MAJOR THEORIES: The APP gene dose hypothesis        interfaces with the amyloid cascade hypothesis of AD as well as with the genetic        and cell biological observations that support it. Moreover, upregulation of        fl-APP protein and products may drive downstream events that dysregulate tau        homeostasis and inflammatory responses that contribute to propagation of AD        pathogenesis.",3480c4b055cba047613dc0479d3a67cf5f7b04c5,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/3480c4b055cba047613dc0479d3a67cf5f7b04c5,32975365,PMC7984396,,False,Alzheimer's & dementia : the journal of the Alzheimer's Association,101231978

The accumulation of        neurotoxic amyloid-β (Aβ) plaques contributes to the pathophysiology of AD. EPHX2        encoding soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH)-a key enzyme for epoxyeicosatrienoic        acid (EET) signaling that is mainly expressed in lysosomes of astrocytes in the        adult brain-is cosited at a locus associated with AD, but it is unclear whether        and how it contributes to the pathophysiology of AD. In this report, we show that        the pharmacologic inhibition of sEH with 1-trifluoromethoxyphenyl-        3-(1-propionylpiperidin-4-yl) urea (TPPU) or the genetic deletion of Ephx2        reduces Aβ deposition in the brains of both male and female familial Alzheimer's        disease (5×FAD) model mice. The inhibition of sEH with TPPU or the genetic        deletion of Ephx2 alleviated cognitive deficits and prevented astrocyte        reactivation in the brains of 6-month-old male 5×FAD mice. 14,15-EET levels in        the brains of these mice were also increased by sEH inhibition. In cultured adult        astrocytes treated with TPPU or 14,15-EET, astrocyte Aβ clearance was increased        through enhanced lysosomal biogenesis. Infusion of 14,15-EET into the hippocampus        of 5×FAD mice prevented the aggregation of Aβ. Notably, a higher concentration of        14,15-EET (200 ng/ml) infusion into the hippocampus reversed Aβ deposition in the        brains of 6-month-old male 5×FAD mice. These results indicate that EET signaling,        especially 14,15-EET, plays a key role in the pathophysiology of AD, and that        targeting this pathway is a potential therapeutic strategy for the treatment of        AD.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT There are limited treatment options for Alzheimer's        disease (AD). EPHX2 encoding soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH) is located at a        locus that is linked to late-onset AD, but its contribution to the        pathophysiology of AD is unclear. Here, we demonstrate that sEH inhibition or        Ephx2 deletion alleviates pathology in familial Alzheimer's disease (5×FAD) mice.        Inhibiting sEH or increasing 14,15-epoxyeicosatrienoic acid (EET) enhanced        lysosomal biogenesis and amyloid-β (Aβ) clearance in cultured adult astrocytes.        Moreover, the infusion of 14,15-EET into the hippocampus of 5×FAD mice not only        prevented the aggregation of Aβ, but also reversed the deposition of Aβ. Thus,        14,15-EET plays a key role in the pathophysiology of AD and therapeutic        strategies that target this pathway may be an effective treatment.",8e8ede754764a69c69b646e96a568eb4cd14b684,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/8e8ede754764a69c69b646e96a568eb4cd14b684,32973044,PMC7574654,background,True,The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for,8102140

10.1016/j.nbd.2020.105072,The effect of amyloid on microglia-neuron interactions before plaque onset occurs independently of TREM2 in a mouse model of Alzheimer’s disease,2020.0,"Genetic studies identified mutations in several immune-related genes that confer        increased risk for developing Alzheimer's disease (AD), suggesting a key role for        microglia in AD pathology. Microglia are recruited to and actively modulate the        local toxicity of amyloid plaques in models of AD through these cells'        transcriptional and functional reprogramming to a disease-associated phenotype.        However, it remains unknown whether microglia actively respond to amyloid        accumulation before plaque deposition in AD. We compared microglial interactions        with neurons that exhibit amyloid accumulation to those that do not in        1-month-old 5XFAD mice to determine which aspects of microglial morphology and        function are altered by early 6E10+ amyloid accumulation. We provide evidence of        preferential microglial process engagement of amyloid laden neurons. Microglia,        on exposure to amyloid, also increase their internalization of neurites even        before plaque onset. Unexpectedly, we found that triggering receptor expressed on        myeloid cells 2 (TREM2), which is critical for microglial responses to amyloid        plaque pathology later in disease, is not required for enhanced microglial        interactions with neurons or neurite internalization early in disease. However,        TREM2 was still required for early morphological changes exhibited by microglia.        These data demonstrate that microglia sense and respond to amyloid accumulation        before plaques form using a distinct mechanism from the TREM2-dependent pathway        required later in disease.",5c3bccc8d8ecd97af563377d48f13ea6f923d51c,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/5c3bccc8d8ecd97af563377d48f13ea6f923d51c,32890775,PMC7808254,,False,Neurobiology of disease,9500169

Once        potential predictors were detected, Cox regression analyses were utilized to        calculate a parsimonious model to estimate differences in time to progression.        The final model included three variables (in order of relevance): left        parahippocampal volume (corrected by intracranial volume, LP_ ICV), delayed        recall (DR), and left inferior occipital lobe individual alpha peak frequency        (LIOL_IAPF). Those MCIs with LP_ICV volume, DR score, and LIOL_IAPF value lower        than the defined cutoff had 6 times, 5.5 times, and 3 times higher risk of        progression to AD, respectively. Besides, when the categories of the three        variables were ""unfavorable"" (i.e., values below the cutoff), 100% of cases        progressed to AD at the end of follow-up. Our results highlighted the relevance        of neurophysiological markers as predictors of conversion (LIOL_IAPF) and the        importance of multivariate models that combine markers of different nature to        predict time to progression from MCI to dementia.",4b87c93c76957e4bcb8880bac6dcd2b510383bd4,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/4b87c93c76957e4bcb8880bac6dcd2b510383bd4,32886293,PMC7732920,background,False,GeroScience,101686284

While genetic        mutations account for only 1% of AD cases, sporadic AD resulting from a        combination of genetic and risk factors constitutes >90% of the cases. Clustered        Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR)-associated protein        (Cas9) is an impactful gene editing tool which identifies a targeted gene        sequence, creating a double-stranded break followed by gene inactivation or        correction. Although CRISPR/Cas9 can be utilized to irreversibly inactivate or        correct faulty genes in AD, a safe and effective delivery system stands as a        challenge against the translation of CRISPR therapeutics from bench to bedside.        While viral vectors are efficient in CRISPR/Cas9 delivery, they might introduce        fatal side effects and immune responses. As non-viral vectors offer a better        safety profile, cost-effectiveness and versatility, they can be promising for the        in vivo delivery of CRISPR/Cas9 therapeutics. In this minireview, we present an        overview of viral and non-viral vector based CRISPR/Cas9 therapeutic strategies        that are being evaluated on pre-clinical AD models. Other promising non-viral        vectors that can be used for genome editing in AD, such as nanoparticles,        nanoclews and microvesicles, are also discussed.

All subjects completed MRI scans, neuropsychological assessments, and        AD-related genotyped analysis. All subjects were divided into high, middle and        low risk groups according to the score of risk genotypes, which included CLU        (rs11136000, rs2279590, rs9331888, and rs9331949) and ABCA7 (rs3764650 and        rs4147929). The genetic effects of CLU, ABCA7, and CLU × ABCA7 on DMN functional        connectivity pattern were further explored. Moreover, the genetic effect of        Apolipoprotein ε4 (APOEε4) was also considered. Finally, correlation analysis was        performed between the signals of brain regions with genetic effect and        neuropsychological test scores. RESULTS: Compared with the low-risk group, the        high-risk group of CLU showed decreased functional connectivity in posterior        cingulate cortex (PCC) and the left middle frontal cortex (P < 0.05, GRF        correction). As for the interaction between the CLU and ABCA7, all the subjects        were divided into high, middle, and low risk group; the middle-risk group was        divided into CLU and ABCA7-dominated middle-risk group. The function connectivity        pattern of DMN among the three or four groups were distributed in the bilateral        medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) and bilateral superior frontal gyrus (SFG) (P <        0.05, GRF correction). When APOEε4 carriers were excluded, the CLU-predominant        middle-risk group displayed the decreased functional connectivity in MPFC when        compared with the low-risk group, while ABCA7-prodominant middle-risk group        displayed decreased functional connectivity in cuneus when compared with the        high-risk group (all P < 0.05, GRF correction). The z values of left middle        frontal cortex were positively correlated with the scores of Serial Dotting Test        (SDT) in high-risk group of CLU, while z values of MPFC and cuneus were        positively correlated to the scores of Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) in        low-risk group of three or four groups. CONCLUSION: The functional connectivity        of MPFC-PCC might be modulated by the interaction of CLU and ABCA7.

Currently, a diagnosis of AD depends        on the clinical symptoms of dementia, magnetic resonance imaging to determine        brain volume, and positron emission tomography imaging to detect brain amyloid or        tau deposition. The best characterized biological fluid markers for AD are        decreased levels of amyloid β-protein (Aβ) 42 and increased levels of        phosphorylated tau and total tau in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). However, less        invasive and easily detectable biomarkers for the diagnosis of AD, especially at        the early stage, are still under development. Here, we provide an overview of        various biomarkers identified in CSF and blood for the diagnostics of AD over the        last 25 years. CSF biomarkers that reflect the three hallmarks of AD, amyloid        deposition, neurofibrillary tangles, and neurodegeneration, are well established.        Based on the need to start treatment in asymptomatic people with AD and to screen        for AD risk in large numbers of young, healthy individuals, the development of        biomarkers for AD is shifting from CSF to blood. Elements of the core        pathogenesis of AD in blood, including Aβ42, tau proteins, plasma proteins, or        lipids have shown their usefulness and capabilities in AD diagnosis. We also        highlight some novel identified blood biomarkers (including Aβ42/Aβ43, p-tau 181,        Aβ42/APP669-711, structure of Aβ in blood, and flotillin) for AD.",3678f30002aa313e0865df392f086648cf36137e,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/3678f30002aa313e0865df392f086648cf36137e,32806668,PMC7564023,background,False,Journal of personalized medicine,101602269

In the past decades, comprehensive data were        generated on the involvement of different signaling pathways in the AD        pathogenesis. However, the utilization of signaling pathways as potential targets        for the development of drugs against AD is rather limited due to the immense        complexity of the brain and intricate molecular links between these pathways.        Therefore, finding a correlation and cross-talk between these signaling pathways        and establishing different therapeutic targets within and between those pathways        are needed for better understanding of the biological events responsible for the        AD-related neurodegeneration. For example, autophagy is a conservative cellular        process that shows link with many other AD-related pathways and is crucial for        maintenance of the correct cellular balance by degrading AD-associated pathogenic        proteins. Considering the central role of autophagy in AD and its interplay with        many other pathways, the finest therapeutic strategy to fight against AD is the        use of autophagy as a target. As an essential step in this direction, this        comprehensive review represents recent findings on the individual AD-related        signaling pathways, describes key features of these pathways and their cross-talk        with autophagy, represents current drug development, and introduces some of the        multitarget beneficial approaches and strategies for the therapeutic intervention        of AD.",4be5d73a7e6b9408614a181f57f93042857651ca,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/4be5d73a7e6b9408614a181f57f93042857651ca,32783388,PMC7876169,background,True,Medicinal research reviews,8103150
10.1016/bs.irn.2020.01.008,"The mitochondrial hypothesis: Dysfunction, bioenergetic defects, and the metabolic link to Alzheimer's disease.",2020.0,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) features mitochondrial dysfunction and altered        metabolism. Other pathologies could drive these changes, or alternatively these        changes could drive other pathologies. In considering this question, it is worth        noting that perturbed AD patient mitochondrial and metabolism dysfunction extend        beyond the brain and to some extent define a systemic phenotype. It is difficult        to attribute this systemic phenotype to brain beta-amyloid or tau proteins.        Conversely, mitochondria increasingly appear to play a critical role in cell        proteostasis, which suggests that mitochondrial dysfunction may promote protein        aggregation. Mitochondrial and metabolism-related characteristics also define AD        endophenotypes in cognitively normal middle-aged individuals, which suggests that        mitochondrial and metabolism-related AD characteristics precede clinical decline.        Genetic analyses increasingly implicate mitochondria and metabolism-relevant        genes in AD risk. Collectively these factors suggest that mitochondria are more        relevant to the causes of AD than its consequences, and support the view that a        mitochondrial cascade features prominently in AD.

We present recent advances on the role        of endosomal acid-base homeostasis in neurodegeneration and discuss evidence for        converging mechanisms. The strongest genetic risk factor in sporadic AD is the ε4        allele of Apolipoprotein E (ApoE4), which potentiates pre-symptomatic endosomal        dysfunction and prominent amyloid beta (Aβ) pathology, although how these        pathways are linked mechanistically has remained unclear. There is emerging        evidence that the Christianson syndrome protein NHE6 is a prominent ApoE4        effector linking endosomal function to Aβ pathologies. By functioning as a        dominant leak pathway for protons, the Na(+)/H(+) exchanger activity of NHE6        limits endosomal acidification and regulates β-secretase (BACE)-mediated Aβ        production and LRP1 receptor-mediated Aβ clearance. Pathological endosomal        acidification may impact both Aβ generation and clearance mechanisms and emerges        as a promising therapeutic target in AD.

The global network dynamics of apolipoprotein E (APOE) e4 allele        group is rarely studied. In our previous brain network study, we have        demonstrated the advantage of persistent homology. It can distinguish robust and        noisy topological features over multiscale nested networks, and the derived        properties are more stable. In this study, for the first time we applied        persistent homology to analyze APOE-related effects on whole-brain functional        network. In our experiments, the risk allele group exhibited lower network radius        and modularity in whole brain DMN based on graph theory, suggesting the abnormal        organization structure.

They were more statistically sensitive to APOE        genotypic differences than standard graph-based measures. In summary, we provide        evidence that the e4 genotype leads to distinct DMN functional alterations in the        early phases of Alzheimer's disease using persistent homology approach.

These are maintained and updated by expert curators extracting        knowledge from unstructured biological data described in free-text journal        articles and converting this into more structured, computationally-accessible        forms. This enables analyses such as functional enrichment of sets of        genes/proteins using the Gene Ontology, and makes the searching of data more        productive by managing issues such as gene/protein name synonyms, identifier        mapping, and data quality. OBJECTIVE: To undertake a coordinated annotation        update of key public-domain resources to better support Alzheimer's disease        research.

The mechanisms underlying the contribution of CAA to        neurodegeneration are not currently understood. Although CAA is highly associated        with the accumulation of amyloid beta (Aβ), other amyloids are known to associate        with the vasculature. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by parenchymal Aβ        deposition, intracellular accumulation of tau, and significant neuroinflammation.        CAA increases with age and is present in 85-95% of individuals with AD. A        substantial amount of research has focused on understanding the connection        between parenchymal amyloid and glial activation and neuroinflammation, while        associations between vascular amyloid pathology and glial reactivity remain        understudied. METHODS: Here, we dissect the glial and immune responses associated        with early-stage CAA with histological, biochemical, and gene expression analyses        in a mouse model of familial Danish dementia (FDD), a neurodegenerative disease        characterized by the vascular accumulation of Danish amyloid (ADan). Findings        observed in this CAA mouse model were complemented with primary culture assays.        RESULTS: We demonstrate that early-stage CAA is associated with dysregulation in        immune response networks and lipid processing, severe astrogliosis with an A1        astrocytic phenotype, and decreased levels of TREM2 with no reactive        microgliosis. Our results also indicate how cholesterol accumulation and ApoE are        associated with vascular amyloid deposits at the early stages of pathology. We        also demonstrate A1 astrocytic mediation of TREM2 and microglia homeostasis.        CONCLUSION: The initial glial response associated with early-stage CAA is        characterized by the upregulation of A1 astrocytes without significant microglial        reactivity.

It contains a long        ectodomain that directly interacts with the extracellular environment to regulate        microglial function. The ectodomain of TREM2 is processed by a disintegrin and        metalloprotease, resulting in the release of a soluble form of TREM2 (sTREM2).        Recent studies have demonstrated that sTREM2 is a bioactive molecule capable of        binding ligands, activating microglia, and regulating immune responses during the        AD continuum. Clinical studies revealed that sTREM2 level is elevated in        cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of AD patients, and the sTREM2 level is positively        correlated with the levels of classical CSF biomarkers, namely t-tau and p-tau,        indicating that it is a reliable predictor of the early stages of AD. Herein, we        summarize the key results on the generation, structure, and function of sTREM2 to        provide new insights into TREM2-related mechanisms underlying AD pathogenesis and        to promote the development of TREM2-based therapeutic strategy.",0a2a5593a1e3e00b04d9f9efe9ebfc1e98f614cf,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0a2a5593a1e3e00b04d9f9efe9ebfc1e98f614cf,32635934,PMC7341574,background,True,Journal of neuroinflammation,101222974
10.3390/pharmaceutics12070599,Double Optimization of Rivastigmine-Loaded Nanostructured Lipid Carriers (NLC) for Nose-to-Brain Delivery Using the Quality by Design (QbD) Approach: Formulation Variables and Instrumental Parameters,2020.0,"Rivastigmine is a drug commonly used in the management of Alzheimer's disease        that shows bioavailability problems. To overcome this, the use of nanosystems,        such as nanostructured lipid carriers (NLC), administered through alternative        routes seems promising. In this work, we performed a double optimization of a        rivastigmine-loaded NLC formulation for direct drug delivery from the nose to the        brain using the quality by design (QbD) approach, whereby the quality target        product profile (QTPP) was the requisite for nose to brain delivery. The        experiments started with the optimization of the formulation variables (or        critical material attributes-CMAs) using a central composite design. The        rivastigmine-loaded NLC formulations with the best critical quality attributes        (CQAs) of particle size, polydispersity index (PDI), zeta potential (ZP), and        encapsulation efficiency (EE) were selected for the second optimization, which        was related to the production methods (ultrasound technique and high-pressure        homogenization). The most suitable instrumental parameters for the production of        NLC were analyzed through a Box-Behnken design, with the same CQAs being        evaluated for the first optimization. For the second part of the optimization        studies, were selected two rivastigmine-loaded NLC formulations: one produced by        ultrasound technique and the other by the high-pressure homogenization (HPH)        method. Afterwards, the pH and osmolarity of these formulations were adjusted to        the physiological nasal mucosa values and in vitro drug release studies were        performed. The results of the first part of the optimization showed that the most        adequate ratios of lipids and surfactants were 7.49:1.94 and 4.5:0.5 (%, w/w),        respectively. From the second part of the optimization, the results for the        particle size, PDI, ZP, and EE of the rivastigmine-loaded NLC formulations        produced by ultrasound technique and HPH method were, respectively, 114.0 ± 1.9        nm and 109.0 ± 0.9 nm; 0.221 ± 0.003 and 0.196 ± 0.007; -30.6 ± 0.3 mV and -30.5        ± 0.3 mV; 97.0 ± 0.5% and 97.2 ± 0.3%. Herein, the HPH was selected as the most        suitable production method, although the ultrasound technique has also shown        effectiveness. In addition, no significant changes in CQAs were observed after 90        days of storage of the formulations at different temperatures. In vitro studies        showed that the release of rivastigmine followed a non-Fickian mechanism, with an        initial fast drug release followed by a prolonged release over 48 h. This study        has optimized a rivastigmine-loaded NLC formulation produced by the HPH method        for nose-to-brain delivery of rivastigmine. The next step is for in vitro and in        vivo experiments to demonstrate preclinical efficacy and safety. QbD was        demonstrated to be a useful approach for the optimization of NLC formulations for        which specific physicochemical requisites can be identified.",c6a43b6dd2b57c905db5d333aa8ceb2e11bc73ea,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/c6a43b6dd2b57c905db5d333aa8ceb2e11bc73ea,32605177,PMC7407548,background,False,Pharmaceutics,101534003
10.1111/imr.12896,The role of innate immunity in Alzheimer's disease,2020.0,"The amyloid hypothesis has dominated Alzheimer's disease (AD) research for almost        30 years. This hypothesis hinges on the predominant clinical role of the amyloid        beta (Aβ) peptide in propagating neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) and eventual        cognitive impairment in AD. Recent research in the AD field has identified the        brain-resident macrophages, known as microglia, and their receptors as integral        regulators of both the initiation and propagation of inflammation, Aβ        accumulation, neuronal loss, and memory decline in AD. Emerging studies have also        begun to reveal critical roles for distinct innate immune pathways in AD        pathogenesis, which has led to great interest in harnessing the innate immune        response as a therapeutic strategy to treat AD. In this review, we will highlight        recent advancements in our understanding of innate immunity and inflammation in        AD onset and progression. Additionally, there has been mounting evidence        suggesting pivotal contributions of environmental factors and lifestyle choices        in AD pathogenesis.

We define robust        co-expression trajectories related to disease progression, including early        neuronal, microglial, astrocyte, and immune response modules, and later mRNA        splicing and mitochondrial modules. The majority of, but not all, modules are        conserved at the transcriptomic level, including module C3, which is only        observed in proteome networks and enriched in mitogen-activated protein kinase        (MAPK) signaling. Genetic risk enriches in modules changing early in disease and        indicates that AD and PSP have distinct causal biological drivers at the pathway        level, despite aspects of similar pathology, including synaptic loss and glial        inflammatory changes.

10.1084/jem.20200785,Anti-human TREM2 induces microglia proliferation and reduces pathology in an Alzheimer’s disease model,2020.0,"TREM2 is a receptor for lipids expressed in microglia. The R47H variant of human        TREM2 impairs ligand binding and increases Alzheimer's disease (AD) risk. In        mouse models of amyloid β (Aβ) accumulation, defective TREM2 function affects        microglial response to Aβ plaques, exacerbating tissue damage, whereas TREM2        overexpression attenuates pathology. Thus, AD may benefit from TREM2 activation.        Here, we examined the impact of an anti-human TREM2 agonistic mAb, AL002c, in a        mouse AD model expressing either the common variant (CV) or the R47H variant of        TREM2. Single-cell RNA-seq of microglia after acute systemic administration of        AL002c showed induction of proliferation in both CV- and R47H-transgenic mice.        Prolonged administration of AL002c reduced filamentous plaques and neurite        dystrophy, impacted behavior, and tempered microglial inflammatory response. We        further showed that a variant of AL002c is safe and well tolerated in a        first-in-human phase I clinical trial and engages TREM2 based on cerebrospinal        fluid biomarkers.

10.1016/j.nbd.2020.104976,Genetic architecture of Alzheimer's disease,2020.0,"Advances in genetic and genomic technologies over the last thirty years have        greatly enhanced our knowledge concerning the genetic architecture of Alzheimer's        disease (AD). Several genes including APP, PSEN1, PSEN2, and APOE have been shown        to exhibit large effects on disease susceptibility, with the remaining risk loci        having much smaller effects on AD risk. Notably, common genetic variants        impacting AD are not randomly distributed across the genome. Instead, these        variants are enriched within regulatory elements active in human myeloid cells,        and to a lesser extent liver cells, implicating these cell and tissue types as        critical to disease etiology. Integrative approaches are emerging as highly        effective for identifying the specific target genes through which AD risk        variants act and will likely yield important insights related to potential        therapeutic targets in the coming years. In the future, additional consideration        of sex- and ethnicity-specific contributions to risk as well as the contribution        of complex gene-gene and gene-environment interactions will likely be necessary        to further improve our understanding of AD genetic architecture.",1a1bd103c0eaf603a93327c1a54f52c513f393bd,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/1a1bd103c0eaf603a93327c1a54f52c513f393bd,32565066,PMC7409822,background,False,Neurobiology of disease,9500169
10.1186/s40035-020-00206-1,Upregulation of RIN3 induces endosomal dysfunction in Alzheimer’s disease,2020.0,"BACKGROUND: In Alzheimer's Disease (AD), about one-third of the risk genes        identified by GWAS encode proteins that function predominantly in the endocytic        pathways. Among them, the Ras and Rab Interactor 3(RIN3) is a guanine nucleotide        exchange factor (GEF) for the Rab5 small GTPase family and has been implicated to        be a risk factor for both late onset AD (LOAD) and sporadic early onset AD        (sEOAD). However, how RIN3 is linked to AD pathogenesis is currently undefined.        METHODS: Quantitative PCR and immunoblotting were used to measure the RIN3        expression level in mouse brain tissues and cultured basal forebrain cholinergic        neuron (BFCNs). Immunostaining was used to define subcellular localization of        RIN3 and to visualize endosomal changes in cultured primary BFCNs and PC12 cells.        Recombinant flag-tagged RIN3 protein was purified from HEK293T cells and was used        to define RIN3-interactomes by mass spectrometry. RIN3-interacting partners were        validated by co-immunoprecipitation, immunofluorescence and yeast two hybrid        assays. Live imaging of primary neurons was used to examine axonal transport of        amyloid precursor protein (APP) and β-secretase 1 (BACE1). Immunoblotting was        used to detect protein expression, processing of APP and phosphorylated forms of        Tau. RESULTS: We have shown that RIN3 mRNA level was significantly increased in        the hippocampus and cortex of APP/PS1 mouse brain. Basal forebrain cholinergic        neurons (BFCNs) cultured from E18 APP/PS1 mouse embryos also showed increased        RIN3 expression accompanied by early endosome enlargement. In addition, via its        proline rich domain, RIN3 recruited BIN1(bridging integrator 1) and CD2AP (CD2        associated protein), two other AD risk factors, to early endosomes.        Interestingly, overexpression of RIN3 or CD2AP promoted APP cleavage to increase        its carboxyl terminal fragments (CTFs) in PC12 cells. Upregulation of RIN3 or the        neuronal isoform of BIN1 increased phosphorylated Tau level. Therefore,        upregulation of RIN3 expression promoted accumulation of APP CTFs and increased        phosphorylated Tau. These effects by RIN3 was rescued by the expression of a        dominant negative Rab5 (Rab5(S34N)) construct. Our study has thus pointed to that        RIN3 acts through Rab5 to impact endosomal trafficking and signaling. CONCLUSION:        RIN3 is significantly upregulated and correlated with endosomal dysfunction in        APP/PS1 mouse. Through interacting with BIN1 and CD2AP, increased RIN3 expression        alters axonal trafficking and procession of APP. Together with our previous        studies, our current work has thus provided important insights into the role of        RIN3 in regulating endosomal signaling and trafficking.",38300846dfff675242527c2fbdc335c991907fd1,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/38300846dfff675242527c2fbdc335c991907fd1,32552912,PMC7301499,,False,Translational neurodegeneration,101591861

As one of the most common neurodegenerative        diseases, AD is characterized by the presence of senile plaques and        neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) in the affected brain area. Microglia are the        major regulators of neuroinflammation in the brain, and neuroinflammation has        become recognized as the core pathophysiological process of various        neurodegenerative diseases. In the central nervous system (CNS), microglia play a        dual role in AD development. For one thing, they degrade amyloid β (Aβ) to resist        its deposition; for another, microglia release pro-inflammatory and inflammatory        factors, contributing to neuroinflammation as well as the spreading of Aβ and tau        pathology. Wnt pathways are important regulators of cell fate and cell        activities. The dysregulation of Wnt pathways is responsible for both abnormal        tau phosphorylation and synaptic loss in AD. Recent studies have also confirmed        the regulatory effect of Wnt signaling on microglial inflammation. Thus, the        study of microglia, Wnt pathways, and their possible interactions may open up a        new direction for understanding the mechanisms of neuroinflammation in AD.

10.1007/s10571-020-00883-6,Role of Microglia in Regulating Cholesterol and Tau Pathology in Alzheimer’s Disease,2020.0,"Cholesterol, a principal constituent of the cell membrane, plays a crucial role        in the brain by regulating the synaptic transmission, neuronal signaling, as well        as neurodegenerative diseases. Defects in the cholesterol trafficking are        associated with enhanced generation of hyperphosphorylated Tau and Amyloid-β        protein. Tau, a major microtubule-associated protein in the brain, is the key        regulator of the mature neuron. Abnormally hyperphosphorylated Tau hampers the        major functions related to microtubule assembly by promoting neurofibrillary        tangles of paired helical filaments, twisted ribbons, and straight filaments.

CCL2 scavenging results aligned with        binding affinity assays, with ACKR2-V41A cells scavenging CCL2 with a lower        efficiency than ACKR2-WT. Cell activation assays also showed that ACKR2-V41A        cells had significantly lower receptor upregulation (β-Arrestin-dependent        signaling pathway) upon stimulation compared to ACKR2-WT cells. These findings        provide molecular and biological mechanistic insights into the GWAS association        of ACKR2-V41A with increased levels of CCL2 in CSF and possibly other chemokine        ligands. Increased CCL2 levels are associated with accelerated cognitive decline        and increased risk of AD. Understanding how this atypical chemokine receptor        allele increases serum markers of inflammation could lead to novel therapeutic        solutions for AD.",5e7f8255d0e851b4bb585449877cb7eec95fb13d,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/5e7f8255d0e851b4bb585449877cb7eec95fb13d,32415244,PMC7229167,,False,Scientific reports,101563288

Identification of underlying mutations in neurodegenerative diseases is        of paramount importance due to the heterogeneous nature of the genome and        different clinical manifestations. An early and accurate molecular diagnosis are        cardinal for neurodegenerative patients to undergo proper therapeutic regimens.        The next-generation sequencing (NGS) method examines up to millions of sequences        at a time. As a result, the rare molecular diagnoses, previously presented with        ""unknown causes"", are now possible in a short time. This method generates a large        amount of data that can be utilized in patient management. Since each person has        a unique genome, the NGS has transformed diagnostic and therapeutic strategies        into sequencing and individual genomic mapping. However, this method has        disadvantages like other diagnostic methods. Therefore, in this review, we aimed        to briefly summarize the NGS method and correlated studies to unravel the genetic        causes of neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's        disease, epilepsy, and MS.

10.1159/000501935,The Genetic Relevance of Human Induced Pluripotent Stem Cell-Derived Microglia to Alzheimer’s Disease and Major Neuropsychiatric Disorders,2019.0,"Microglia are the primary innate immune cell type in the brain that have been        implicated in the pathogenesis of several neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric        disorders, most notably Alzheimer's disease (AD) and schizophrenia. Microglia        generated from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) represent a        promising in vitro cellular model for studying the neuroimmune interactions        involved in these disorders. Among several methods of generating -hiPSC-derived        microglia (iMG) - varying in duration and resultant purity - a recent protocol by        Brownjohn et al. [Stem Cell Reports. 2018 Apr;10(4):1294-307] is particularly        simple and efficient. However, the replicability of this method, transcriptomic        similarity of these iMG to primary adult microglia, and their genetic relevance        to disease (i.e., enrichment of disease risk loci in genes preferentially        expressed in these cells) remains unclear. Using two hiPSC lines, we demonstrated        that Brownjohn's protocol can rapidly generate iMG that morphologically and        functionally resembled microglia. The iMG cells we generated were found to be        transcriptionally similar to previously reported iMG, as well as fetal and adult        microglia. Furthermore, by using cell type-specific gene expression to partition        disease heritability, we showed that iMG cells are genetically relevant to AD but        found no significant enrichments of risk loci of Parkinson's disease,        schizophrenia, major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, autism spectrum        disorder, or body mass index. Across a range of neuronal and immune cell types,        we found only iMG, primary microglia, and microglia-like cell types exhibited a        significant enrichment for AD heritability. Our results thus support the use of        iMG as a human cellular model for understanding AD biology and underlying genetic        factors, as well as for developing and efficiently screening new therapeutics.",bd55455cfaca536d95ef6f19d520cbd69fec9e98,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/bd55455cfaca536d95ef6f19d520cbd69fec9e98,32399472,PMC7206606,,False,Molecular neuropsychiatry,101649121

Mutations in the PS genes are a major cause of        familial early-onset Alzheimer disease and affect the cleavage of the amyloid        precursor protein, thereby altering the production of the amyloid β-peptide.        However, multiple additional protein substrates have been identified, suggesting        pleiotropic functions of γ-secretase. Here, we demonstrate that inhibition of        γ-secretase causes dysregulation of cellular lipid homeostasis, including        up-regulation of liver X receptors, and complex changes in the cellular lipid        composition. Genetic and pharmacological inhibition of γsecretase leads to strong        accumulation of cytoplasmic lipid droplets, associated with increased levels of        acylglycerols, but lowered cholesteryl esters. Furthermore, accumulation of lipid        droplets was augmented by increasing levels of amyloid precursor protein        C-terminal fragments, indicating a critical involvement of this γ-secretase        substrate. Together, these data provide a mechanism that functionally connects        γ-secretase activity to cellular lipid metabolism. These effects were also        observed in human astrocytic cells, indicating an important function of        γ-secretase in cells critical for lipid homeostasis in the brain.",d20a9519bdad8e0b6355403c94f1fbaf6d90189e,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/d20a9519bdad8e0b6355403c94f1fbaf6d90189e,32354700,PMC7195048,background,False,Life science alliance,101728869

These biomarkers are considered to        contribute, at least in part, to the neurodegenerative events of the disease. But        the accumulation of plaques and tangles is widely considered to be a later event        with other factors likely being the cause of the disease. Calcium        dysregulation-the unregulated accumulation of calcium ions-in neurons is an early        event that underlies neurodegeneration. In 2002, O'Day and Myre extended this        ""Calcium Hypothesis"" to include calmodulin (CaM) the primary target of calcium,        suggesting the ""Calmodulin Hypothesis"" as an updated alternative. Here we        overview the central role of CaM in the formation of the classic hallmarks of AD:        plaques and tangles. Then some insight into CaM's binding to various risk factor        proteins is given followed by a short summary of specific receptors and channels        linked to the disease that are CaM binding proteins. Overall, this review        emphasizes the diversity of Alzheimer's-linked CaM-binding proteins validating        the hypothesis that CaM operates critically at all stages of the disease and        stands out as a potential primary target for future research.",e3d9f5abdaa4a2921bb43ff2c494adfdfc7bd500,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/e3d9f5abdaa4a2921bb43ff2c494adfdfc7bd500,32341979,PMC7179355,background,False,AIMS neuroscience,101665668
10.15252/embr.201947954,AP‐2 reduces amyloidogenesis by promoting BACE1 trafficking and degradation in neurons,2020.0,"Cleavage of amyloid precursor protein (APP) by BACE-1 (β-site APP cleaving enzyme        1) is the rate-limiting step in amyloid-β (Aβ) production and a neuropathological        hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Despite decades of research, mechanisms of        amyloidogenic APP processing remain highly controversial. Here, we show that in        neurons, APP processing and Aβ production are controlled by the protein complex-2        (AP-2), an endocytic adaptor known to be required for APP endocytosis. Now, we        find that AP-2 prevents amyloidogenesis by additionally functioning downstream of        BACE1 endocytosis, regulating BACE1 endosomal trafficking and its delivery to        lysosomes. AP-2 is decreased in iPSC-derived neurons from patients with        late-onset AD, while conditional AP-2 knockout (KO) mice exhibit increased Aβ        production, resulting from accumulation of BACE1 within late endosomes and        autophagosomes. Deletion of BACE1 decreases amyloidogenesis and mitigates synapse        loss in neurons lacking AP-2. Taken together, these data suggest a mechanism for        BACE1 intracellular trafficking and degradation via an endocytosis-independent        function of AP-2 and reveal a novel role for endocytic proteins in AD.",a630e106a4199d979cfb22ccabafc5baba32c23d,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/a630e106a4199d979cfb22ccabafc5baba32c23d,32323475,PMC7271323,background,False,EMBO reports,100963049

Key to the development of such therapies is the appropriate selection of        modeling systems in which to investigate disease mechanisms and to test candidate        interventions. There are unique challenges in the development of representative        laboratory models of neurodegenerative diseases, including the complexity of the        human brain, the cumulative and variable contributions of genetic and        environmental factors over the course of a lifetime, inability to culture human        primary neurons, and critical central nervous system differences between small        animal models and humans. While traditional rodent models have advanced our        understanding of neurodegenerative disease mechanisms, key divergences such as        the species-specific genetic background can limit the application of animal        models in many cases. Here we review in vitro human neuronal systems that employ        stem cell and reprogramming technology and their application to a range of        neurodegenerative diseases.

10.1073/pnas.1914593117,Early intraneuronal amyloid triggers neuron-derived inflammatory signaling in APP transgenic rats and human brain,2020.0,"Chronic inflammation during Alzheimer's disease (AD) is most often attributed to        sustained microglial activation in response to amyloid-β (Aβ) plaque deposits and        cell death. However, cytokine release and microgliosis are consistently observed        in AD transgenic animal models devoid of such pathologies, bringing into question        the underlying processes that may be at play during the earliest AD-related        immune response. We propose that this plaque-independent inflammatory reaction        originates from neurons burdened with increasing levels of soluble and oligomeric        Aβ, which are known to be the most toxic amyloid species within the brain. Laser        microdissected neurons extracted from preplaque amyloid precursor protein (APP)        transgenic rats were found to produce a variety of potent immune factors, both at        the transcript and protein levels. Neuron-derived cytokines correlated with the        extent of microglial activation and mobilization, even in the absence of        extracellular plaques and cell death. Importantly, we identified an inflammatory        profile unique to Aβ-burdened neurons, since neighboring glial cells did not        express similar molecules. Moreover, we demonstrate within disease-vulnerable        regions of the human brain that a neuron-specific inflammatory response may        precede insoluble Aβ plaque and tau tangle formation.

The SNaPshot        technique and polymer chain reaction (PCR) were used to detect the 18 SNPs.        Combined with the apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε4 allele and age at onset, we        performed an association analysis between these SNPs and AD susceptibility.        Furthermore, we analyzed SNP-associated gene expression using the expression        quantitative trait loci analysis. RESULTS: Our study found that rs17125924 of        FERMT2 was associated with the risk of developing AD in the dominant (P = 0.022,        odds ratio [OR] = 1.57, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.07-2.32) and overdominant        (P = 0.005, OR = 1.76, 95% CI: 1.18-2.61) models. Moreover, compared with APOE ε4        non-carriers, the frequency of the G-allele at rs17125924 was significantly        higher among AD patients in APOE ε4 allele carriers (P = 0.029).

Then, the alleles found to be associated with sAD were used        to build polygenic risk score (PRS) models to represent the genetic risk.        Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analyses and the Cox proportional hazards        model were used to evaluate the predictive value of PRS for the sAD risk and age        at onset.

As        the key player in the brain innate immune system, microglia has now taken a        center stage in AD research. A large number of AD risk loci identified by        genome-wide association studies are located in or near the genes highly expressed        in microglia. Among them, the triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2        (TREM2) has drawn much attention. A rare variant in TREM2 increases AD risk with        an odds ratio comparable to the strongest genetic risk factor apolipoprotein ε4        allele.

However, with        the growing divide between model systems and clinical therapeutic outcomes, the        limitations of these approaches are increasingly apparent. Thus, to generate more        clinically relevant systems that capture pathological cascades within human        neurons, we generated human-induced neurons (HiNs) from AD and non-AD individuals        to model cell autonomous disease properties. We selected an AD patient population        expressing mutations in presenilin 1 (mPS1), which is linked to increased amyloid        production, tau pathology, and calcium signaling abnormalities, among other        features. While these AD components are detailed in model systems, they have yet        to be collectively identified in human neurons. Thus, we conducted molecular,        immune-based, electrophysiological, and calcium imaging studies to establish        patterns of cellular pathology in this patient population. We found that mPS1        HiNs generate increased Aβ(42) and hyperphosphorylated tau species relative to        non-AD controls, and exaggerated ER calcium responses that are normalized with        ryanodine receptor (RyR) negative allosteric modulators. The inflammasome        product, interleukin-18 (IL-18), also increased PS1 expression. This work        highlights the potential for HiNs to model AD pathology and validates their role        in defining cellular pathogenesis and their utility for therapeutic screening.",4cf67bb24099a6a9ea5894b0f9253a22738a0fe9,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/4cf67bb24099a6a9ea5894b0f9253a22738a0fe9,32033164,PMC7037274,background,False,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791
10.2174/1570159X18666200207120949,Role of Nuclear Factor Kappa B (NF-KB) Signalling in Neurodegenerative Diseases: An Mechanistic Approach,2020.0,"A transcriptional regulatory nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) protein is a        modulator of cellular biological activity via binding to a promoter region in the        nucleus and transcribing various protein genes. The recent research implicated        the intensive role of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) in diseases like autoimmune        disorder, inflammatory, cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases. Therefore,        targeting the nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) protein offers a new opportunity as        a therapeutic approach. Activation of IκB kinase/NF-κB signaling pathway leads to        the development of various pathological conditions in human beings, such as        neurodegenerative, inflammatory disorders, autoimmune diseases, and cancer.        Therefore, the transcriptional activity of IκB kinase/NF- κB is strongly        regulated at various cascade pathways. The nuclear factor NF-kB pathway plays a        major role in the expression of pro-inflammatory genes, including cytokines,        chemokines, and adhesion molecules. In response to the diverse stimuli, the        cytosolic sequestered NF-κB in an inactivated form by binding with an inhibitor        molecule protein (IkB) gets phosphorylated and translocated into the nucleus        further transcribing various genes necessary for modifying various cellular        functions. The various researches confirmed the role of different family member        proteins of NF-κB implicated in expressing various genes products and mediating        various cellular cascades. MicroRNAs, as regulators of NF- κB microRNAs play        important roles in the regulation of the inflammatory process. Therefore, the        inhibitor of NF-κB and its family members plays a novel therapeutic target in        preventing various diseases.

10.1186/s12868-020-0554-0,Proximity ligation assay reveals both pre- and postsynaptic localization of the APP-processing enzymes ADAM10 and BACE1 in rat and human adult brain,2020.0,"BACKGROUND: Synaptic degeneration and accumulation of amyloid β-peptides (Aβ) are        hallmarks of the Alzheimer diseased brain. Aβ is synaptotoxic and produced by        sequential cleavage of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) by the β-secretase        BACE1 and by γ-secretase. If APP is instead cleaved by the α-secretase ADAM10, Aβ        will not be generated. Although BACE1 is considered to be a presynaptic protein        and ADAM10 has been reported to mainly localize to the postsynaptic density, we        have previously shown that both ADAM10 and BACE1 are highly enriched in synaptic        vesicles of rat brain and mouse primary hippocampal neurons. RESULTS: Here, using        brightfield proximity ligation assay, we expanded our previous result in primary        neurons and investigated the in situ synaptic localization of ADAM10 and BACE1 in        rat and human adult brain using both pre- and postsynaptic markers. We found that        ADAM10 and BACE1 were in close proximity with both the presynaptic marker        synaptophysin and the postsynaptic marker PSD-95. The substrate APP was also        detected both pre- and postsynaptically. Subcellular fractionation confirmed that        ADAM10 and BACE1 are enriched to a similar degree in synaptic vesicles and as        well as in the postsynaptic density. CONCLUSIONS: We show that the α-secretase        ADAM10 and the β-secretase BACE1 are located in both the pre- and postsynaptic        compartments in intact brain sections.

Among the most provocative recent results in DGC has been that the alter        of the cellular cytoskeleton and intercellular adhesion. CD2-associated protein        (CD2AP) is one of the critical proteins regulating cytoskeleton assembly and        intercellular adhesion. However, no study has investigated the expression and        biological significance of CD2AP in gastric cancer (GC) to date. Therefore, the        aim of our study was to explore if the expression of CD2AP is associated with any        clinical features of GC and to elucidate the underlying mechanism.        Immunohistochemistry of 620 patient tissue samples indicated that the expression        of CD2AP is downregulated in DGC. Moreover, a low CD2AP level was indicative of        poor patient prognosis. In vitro, forced expression of CD2AP caused a significant        decrease in the migration and invasion of GC cells, whereas depletion of CD2AP        had the opposite effect. Immunofluorescence analysis indicated that CD2AP        promoted cellular adhesion and influenced cell cytoskeleton assembly via        interaction with the F-actin capping protein CAPZA1.

This study was to evaluate the effects of known pathogenic gene        mutation and disease progression on the striatum- and hippocampus-related neural        circuits, including frontostriatal and hippocampus-posterior cingulate cortex        (PCC) pathways. METHODS: A total of 102 healthy mutation non-carriers, 40        presymptomatic mutation carriers (PMC), and 30 symptomatic mutation carriers        (SMC) of amyloid precursor protein (APP), presenilin 1 (PS1), or presenilin 2        gene, with T1 structural MRI, diffusion tensor imaging, and resting-state        functional MRI were included. Representative neural circuits and their key nodes        were obtained, including bilateral caudate-rostral middle frontal gyrus (rMFG),        putamen-rMFG, and hippocampus-PCC. Volumes, diffusion indices, and functional        connectivity of circuits were compared between groups and correlated with        neuropsychological and clinical measures. RESULTS: In PMC, APP gene mutation        carriers showed impaired diffusion indices of caudate-rMFG and putamen-rMFG        circuits; PS1 gene mutation carriers showed increased fiber numbers of        putamen-rMFG circuit. SMC showed increased diffusivity of the left        hippocampus-PCC circuit and volume reduction of all regions as compared with PMC.        Imaging measures especially axial diffusivity of the representative circuits were        correlated with neuropsychological measures. CONCLUSIONS: APP and PS1 gene        mutations affect frontostriatal circuits in a different manner in familial        Alzheimer's disease; disease progression primarily affects the structure of        hippocampus-PCC circuit. The structural connectivity of both frontostriatal and        hippocampus-PCC circuits is associated with general cognitive function.

Methyl-CpG Binding Protein 2 (MeCP2) is an important epigenetic        regulator enriched in the brain, and recent findings have implicated MeCP2 as a        crucial player in Alzheimer disease. Here, we provide comprehensive insights into        the pathophysiological roles of MeCP2 in Alzheimer disease. In particular, we        focus on how the alteration of MeCP2 expression can impact Alzheimer disease        through risk genes, amyloid-β and tau pathology, cell death and        neurodegeneration, and cellular senescence. We suggest that Alzheimer disease can        be adversely affected by upregulated MeCP2-dependent repression of risk genes        (MEF2C, ADAM10, and PM20D1), increased tau accumulation, and neurodegeneration        through neuronal cell death (excitotoxicity and apoptosis). In addition, we        propose that the progression of Alzheimer disease could be caused by reduced        MeCP2-mediated enhancement of astrocytic and microglial senescence and consequent        glial SASP (senescence-associated secretory phenotype)-dependent        neuroinflammation.

10.1001/jamaneurol.2019.3762,Minocycline at 2 Different Dosages vs Placebo for Patients With Mild Alzheimer Disease,2019.0,"IMPORTANCE: There are no disease-modifying treatments for Alzheimer disease (AD),        the most common cause of dementia. Minocycline is anti-inflammatory, protects        against the toxic effects of β-amyloid in vitro and in animal models of AD, and        is a credible repurposed treatment candidate. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether 24        months of minocycline treatment can modify cognitive and functional decline in        patients with mild AD. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Participants were        recruited into a double-blind randomized clinical trial from May 23, 2014, to        April 14, 2016, with 24 months of treatment and follow-up. This multicenter study        in England and Scotland involved 32 National Health Service memory clinics within        secondary specialist services for people with dementia. From 886 screened        patients, 554 patients with a diagnosis of mild AD (Standardised Mini-Mental        State Examination [sMMSE] score ≥24) were randomized. INTERVENTIONS: Participants        were randomly allocated 1:1:1 in a semifactorial design to receive minocycline        (400 mg/d or 200 mg/d) or placebo for 24 months. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES:        Primary outcome measures were decrease in sMMSE score and Bristol Activities of        Daily Living Scale (BADLS), analyzed by intention-to-treat repeated-measures        regression. RESULTS: Of 544 eligible participants (241 women and 303 men), the        mean (SD) age was 74.3 (8.2) years, and the mean (SD) sMMSE score was 26.4 (1.9).        Fewer participants completed 400-mg minocycline hydrochloride treatment (28.8%        [53 of 184]) than 200-mg minocycline treatment (61.9% [112 of 181]) or placebo        (63.7% [114 of 179]; P < .001), mainly because of gastrointestinal symptoms (42        in the 400-mg group, 15 in the 200-mg group, and 10 in the placebo group;        P < .001), dermatologic adverse effects (10 in the 400-mg group, 5 in the 200-mg        group, and 1 in the placebo group; P = .02), and dizziness (14 in the 400-mg        group, 3 in the 200-mg group, and 1 in the placebo group; P = .01). Assessment        rates were lower in the 400-mg group: 68.4% (119 of 174 expected) for sMMSE at 24        months compared with 81.8% (144 of 176) for the 200-mg group and 83.8% (140 of        167) for the placebo group. Decrease in sMMSE scores over 24 months in the        combined minocycline group was similar to that in the placebo group (4.1 vs 4.3        points). The combined minocycline group had mean sMMSE scores 0.1 points higher        than the placebo group (95% CI, -1.1 to 1.2; P = .90). The decrease in mean sMMSE        scores was less in the 400-mg group than in the 200-mg group (3.3 vs 4.7 points;        treatment effect = 1.2; 95% CI, -0.1 to 2.5; P = .08). Worsening of BADLS scores        over 24 months was similar in all groups: 5.7 in the 400-mg group, 6.6 in the        200-mg group, and 6.2 in the placebo groups (treatment effect for minocycline vs        placebo = -0.53; 95% CI, -2.4 to 1.3; P = .57; treatment effect for 400 mg vs 200        mg of minocycline = -0.31; 95% CI, -0.2 to 1.8; P = .77). Results were similar in        different patient subgroups and in sensitivity analyses adjusting for missing        data.

Late-onset AD is observed in about 95% of patients, and        APOE4-encoding apolipoprotein E4 (ApoE4) is strongly associated with these cases.        As an apolipoprotein, the function of ApoE in brain cholesterol transport has        been extensively studied and widely appreciated. Development of new technologies        such as human-induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) and CRISPR-Cas9 genome        editing tools have enabled us to develop human brain model systems in vitro and        readily manipulate genomic information. In the context of these advances, recent        studies provide strong evidence that abnormal cholesterol metabolism by ApoE4        could be linked to AD-associated pathology. In this review, we discuss novel        discoveries in brain cholesterol dysregulation by ApoE4. We further elaborate        cell type-specific roles in cholesterol regulation of four major brain cell        types, neurons, astrocytes, microglia, and oligodendrocytes, and how its        dysregulation can be linked to AD pathology.",843dbe90c27ffc459ecc2a833ad7a32be8c378fd,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/843dbe90c27ffc459ecc2a833ad7a32be8c378fd,31711277,PMC6883979,background,True,Molecules and cells,9610936

While the primary function        of ABCA7 is to regulate the transport of phospholipids and cholesterol, ABCA7 is        also involved in maintaining homeostasis of the immune system. Since inflammatory        pathways causatively or consequently participate in AD pathogenesis, we studied        the effects of Abca7 haplodeficiency in mice on brain immune responses under        acute and chronic conditions. When acute inflammation was induced through        peripheral lipopolysaccharide injection in control or heterozygous Abca7 knockout        mice, partial ABCA7 deficiency diminished proinflammatory responses by impairing        CD14 expression in the brain. On breeding to App(NL-G-F) knockin mice, we        observed increased amyloid-β (Aβ) accumulation and abnormal endosomal morphology        in microglia. Taken together, our results demonstrate that ABCA7 loss of function        may contribute to AD pathogenesis by altering proper microglial responses to        acute inflammatory challenges and during the development of amyloid pathology,        providing insight into disease mechanisms and possible treatment strategies.",2835c88b5d3d75db99c89490123c4f7d7c2dcbbf,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/2835c88b5d3d75db99c89490123c4f7d7c2dcbbf,31690660,PMC6876254,background,False,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876

METHODS: The ability of        systemically administered lipopolysaccharide (LPS - 500 μg/kg) to effect acute        and chronic behavioural changes in C57BL/6 and P301S tauopathy mice was assessed.        Markers of pathology were assessed in the brain and spinal cord. RESULTS: P301S        mice display regional microgliosis. Systemic LPS treatment induced exaggerated        acute sickness behaviour and motor dysfunction in P301S mice compared with        wild-type controls and advanced the onset and accelerated chronic decline. LPS        treatment was associated with increased tau pathology 24 hours after LPS        injection and spinal cord microgliosis at the end stage. DISCUSSION: This is the        first demonstration that a single systemic inflammatory episode causes        exaggerated acute functional impairments and accelerates the long-term trajectory        of functional decline associated with neurodegeneration in a mouse model of human        tauopathy.

We have reported pronounced loss of S1P and SK2 activity early in        Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis, and an inverse correlation between        hippocampal S1P levels and age in females, leading us to speculate that loss of        S1P is a sensitizing influence for AD. Paradoxically, SK2 was reported to mediate        amyloid β (Aβ) formation from amyloid precursor protein (APP) in vitro To        determine whether loss of S1P sensitizes to Aβ-mediated neurodegeneration, we        investigated whether SK2 deficiency worsens pathology and memory in male J20        (PDGFB-APP(SwInd)) mice. SK2 deficiency greatly reduced Aβ content in J20 mice,        associated with significant improvements in epileptiform activity and        cross-frequency coupling measured by hippocampal electroencephalography. However,        several key measures of APP(SwInd)-dependent neurodegeneration were enhanced on        the SK2-null background, despite reduced Aβ burden. These included hippocampal        volume loss, oligodendrocyte attrition and myelin loss, and impaired performance        in Y-maze and social novelty memory tests. Inhibition of the endosomal        cholesterol exporter NPC1 greatly reduced sphingosine phosphorylation in glial        cells, linking loss of SK2 activity and S1P in AD to perturbed endosomal lipid        metabolism. Our findings establish SK2 as an important endogenous regulator of        both APP processing to Aβ, and oligodendrocyte survival, in vivo These results        urge greater consideration of the roles played by oligodendrocyte dysfunction and        altered membrane lipid metabolic flux as drivers of neurodegeneration in        AD.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Genetic, neuropathological, and functional studies        implicate both Aβ and altered lipid metabolism and/or signaling as key pathogenic        drivers of Alzheimer's disease. In this study, we first demonstrate that the        enzyme SK2, which generates the signaling lipid S1P, is required for Aβ formation        from APP in vivo Second, we establish a new role for SK2 in the protection of        oligodendrocytes and myelin. Loss of SK2 sensitizes to Aβ-mediated        neurodegeneration by attenuating oligodendrocyte survival and promoting        hippocampal atrophy, despite reduced Aβ burden. Our findings support a model in        which Aβ-independent sensitizing influences such as loss of neuroprotective S1P        are more important drivers of neurodegeneration than gross Aβ concentration or        plaque density.",5877d6ebdad13650d760413b1051f489b363edfa,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/5877d6ebdad13650d760413b1051f489b363edfa,31641049,PMC6880469,background,False,The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for,8102140

However,        the degree to which genetic risk of Alzheimer's dementia contributes to late-life        motor impairment, and the specific molecular systems underlying these        associations, are uncertain. Here, we adopted an integrative multi-omic approach        to assess genetic influence on motor impairment in older adults and identified        key molecular pathways that may mediate this risk. We built a polygenic risk        score for clinical diagnosis of Alzheimer's dementia (AD-PRS) and examined its        relationship to several motor phenotypes in 1885 older individuals from two        longitudinal aging cohorts. We found that AD-PRS was associated with a previously        validated composite motor scores and their components. The major genetic risk        factor for sporadic Alzheimer's dementia, the APOE/TOMM40 locus, was not a major        driver of these associations. To identify specific molecular features that        potentially medicate the genetic risk into motor dysfunction, we examined brain        multi-omics, including transcriptome, DNA methylation, histone acetylation        (H3K9AC), and targeted proteomics, as well as diverse neuropathologies.

Lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a potent pro-inflammatory endotoxin produced by        the gut, is found in excess levels in AD where it associates with neurological        hallmarks of pathology. Sex differences in susceptibility to inflammation and AD        progression have been reported, but how this impacts on LPS responses remains        under investigated. We previously reported in an APP/PS1 model of AD that        systemic LPS administration rapidly altered hippocampal metabolism in males.        Here, we used untargeted metabolomics to comprehensively identify hippocampal        metabolic processes occurring at onset of systemic inflammation with LPS        (100 µg/kg, i.v.) in APP/PS1 mice, at an early pathological stage, and        investigated the sexual dimorphism in this response. Four hours after LPS        administration, pathways regulating energy metabolism, immune and oxidative        stress responses were simultaneously recruited in the hippocampi of 4.5-month-old        mice with a more protective response in females despite their pro-inflammatory        and pro-oxidant metabolic signature in the absence of immune stimulation. LPS        induced comparable behavioural sickness responses in male and female wild-type        and APP/PS1 mice and comparable activation of both the serotonin and nicotinamide        pathways of tryptophan metabolism in their hippocampi. Elevations in        N-methyl-2-pyridone-5-carboxamide, a major toxic metabolite of nicotinamide,        correlated with behavioural sickness regardless of sex, as well as with the        LPS-induced hypothermia seen in males. Males also exhibited a        pro-inflammatory-like downregulation of pyruvate metabolism, exacerbated in        APP/PS1 males, and methionine metabolism whereas females showed a greater        cytokine response and anti-inflammatory-like downregulation of hippocampal        methylglyoxal and methionine metabolism. Metabolic changes were not associated        with morphological markers of immune cell activation suggesting that they        constitute an early event in the development of LPS-induced neuroinflammation and        AD exacerbation.

The cardinal pathological        features of the disease have been known for more than one hundred years, and        today the presence of these amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles are still        required for a pathological diagnosis. Alzheimer's disease is the most common        cause of dementia globally. There remain no effective treatment options for the        great majority of patients, and the primary causes of the disease are unknown        except in a small number of familial cases driven by genetic mutations.        Confounding efforts to develop effective diagnostic tools and disease-modifying        therapies is the realization that Alzheimer's disease is a mixed proteinopathy        (amyloid and tau) frequently associated with other age-related processes such as        cerebrovascular disease and Lewy body disease. Defining the relationships between        and interdependence of various co-pathologies remains an active area of        investigation. This review outlines etiologically-linked pathologic features of        Alzheimer's disease, as well as those that are inevitable findings of uncertain        significance, such as granulovacuolar degeneration and Hirano bodies. Other        disease processes that are frequent, but not inevitable, are also discussed,        including pathologic processes that can clinically mimic Alzheimer's disease.        These include cerebrovascular disease, Lewy body disease, TDP-43 proteinopathies        and argyrophilic grain disease.

Strong evidence from clinical and basic        research suggests that a major pathway by which APOE4 increases the risk of AD is        by driving earlier and more abundant amyloid pathology in the brains of APOE*ε4        carriers. The number of amyloid-β (Aβ)-dependent and Aβ-independent pathways that        are known to be differentially modulated by APOE isoforms is increasing. For        example, evidence is accumulating that APOE influences tau pathology,        tau-mediated neurodegeneration and microglial responses to AD-related        pathologies. In addition, APOE4 is either pathogenic or shows reduced efficiency        in multiple brain homeostatic pathways, including lipid transport, synaptic        integrity and plasticity, glucose metabolism and cerebrovascular function.

Though several risk factors are        shared between these two diseases, the exact relationship between them is still        unknown. In this paper, we analyzed how these two diseases relate to each other        from the genomic, epigenomic, and transcriptomic viewpoints. Using an extensive        literature mining, we first accumulated the list of genes from major genome-wide        association (GWAS) studies. Based on these GWAS studies, we observed that only        one gene (HLA-DRB5) was shared between AD and PD. A subsequent literature search        identified a few other genes involved in these two diseases, among which SIRT1        seemed to be the most prominent one. While we listed all the miRNAs that have        been previously reported for AD and PD separately, we found only 15 different        miRNAs that were reported in both diseases. In order to get better insights, we        predicted the gene co-expression network for both AD and PD using network        analysis algorithms applied to two GEO datasets. The network analysis revealed        six clusters of genes related to AD and four clusters of genes related to PD;        however, there was very low functional similarity between these clusters,        pointing to insignificant similarity between AD and PD even at the level of        affected biological processes.

The etiology and pathogenesis of AD have not yet been        elucidated. We examined common differentially expressed genes (DEGs) from        different AD tissue microarray datasets by meta-analysis and screened the        AD-associated genes from the common DEGs using GCBI. Then we studied the gene        expression network using the STRING database and identified the hub genes using        Cytoscape. Furthermore, we analyzed the microRNAs (miRNAs), long non-coding RNAs        (lncRNAs), and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with the        AD-associated genes, and then identified feed-forward loops. Finally, we        performed SNP analysis of the AD-associated genes. Our results identified 207        common DEGs, of which 57 have previously been reported to be associated with AD.        The common DEG expression network identified eight hub genes, all of which were        previously known to be associated with AD. Further study of the regulatory miRNAs        associated with the AD-associated genes and other genes specific to        neurodegenerative diseases revealed 65 AD-associated miRNAs.

10.1093/bioinformatics/btz561,GSMA: an approach to identify robust global and test Gene Signatures using Meta-Analysis,2019.0,"MOTIVATION: Recent advances in biomedical research have made massive amount of        transcriptomic data available in public repositories from different sources. Due        to the heterogeneity present in the individual experiments, identifying        reproducible biomarkers for a given disease from multiple independent studies has        become a major challenge. The widely used meta-analysis approaches, such as        Fisher's method, Stouffer's method, minP and maxP, have at least two major        limitations: (i) they are sensitive to outliers, and (ii) they perform only one        statistical test for each individual study, and hence do not fully utilize the        potential sample size to gain statistical power. RESULTS: Here, we propose a        gene-level meta-analysis framework that overcomes these limitations and        identifies a gene signature that is reliable and reproducible across multiple        independent studies of a given disease. The approach provides a comprehensive        global signature that can be used to understand the underlying biological        phenomena, and a smaller test signature that can be used to classify future        samples of a given disease. We demonstrate the utility of the framework by        constructing disease signatures for influenza and Alzheimer's disease using nine        datasets including 1108 individuals. These signatures are then validated on 12        independent datasets including 912 individuals. The results indicate that the        proposed approach performs better than the majority of the existing meta-analysis        approaches in terms of both sensitivity as well as specificity.

Studies of        pathogenesis are essential for defining targets for discovering disease-modifying        treatments. Past studies of AD neuropathology provided valuable, albeit limited,        insights. Nevertheless, building on these findings, recent studies have provided        an increasingly rich harvest of genetic, molecular and cellular data that are        creating unprecedented opportunities to both understand and treat AD. Among the        most significant are those documenting the presence within the AD brain of toxic        oligomeric species of Aβ and tau. Existing data support the view that such        species can propagate and spread within neural circuits. To place these findings        in context we first review the genetics and neuropathology of AD, including AD in        Down syndrome (AD-DS). We detail studies that support the existence of toxic        oligomeric species while noting the significant unanswered questions concerning        their precise structures, the means by which they spread and undergo        amplification and how they induce neuronal dysfunction and degeneration.

Genetic evidence strongly suggests that aberrant generation        and/or clearance of the neurotoxic amyloid-β peptide (Aβ) is triggering the        disease. Aβ is generated from the amyloid precursor protein (APP) by the        sequential cleavages of β- and γ-secretase. The latter cleavage by γ-secretase, a        unique and fascinating four-component protease complex, occurs in the APP        transmembrane domain thereby releasing Aβ species of 37-43 amino acids in length        including the longer, highly pathogenic peptides Aβ42 and Aβ43. The lack of a        precise understanding of Aβ generation as well as of the functions of other        γ-secretase substrates has been one factor underlying the disappointing failure        of γ-secretase inhibitors in clinical trials, but on the other side also been a        major driving force for structural and in depth mechanistic studies on this key        AD drug target in the past few years.

Herein, we used a specific marker of microglia (TMEM119) and a        cell-type expression profiling tool (CellMapper) to identify a human microglial        gene expression module. Surprisingly, we found that microglial module genes are        robustly expressed in several healthy human brain regions known to be vulnerable        in AD, in addition to other regions affected only later in disease or spared in        AD. Surveying the microglial gene set for differential expression over the        lifespan in mouse models of AD and a related tauopathy revealed that the majority        of microglial module genes were significantly upregulated in cortex and        hippocampus as a function of age and transgene status. Extending these results,        we also observed significant upregulation of microglial module genes in several        AD-affected brain regions in addition to other regions using postmortem brain        tissue from human AD samples. In pathologically confirmed AD cases, we found        preliminary evidence that microglial genes may be dysregulated in a sex-specific        manner. Finally, we identified specific and significant overlap between the        described microglial gene set-identified by unbiased co-expression analysis-and        genes known to impart risk for AD. Our findings suggest that microglial genes        show enriched expression in AD-vulnerable brain regions, are upregulated during        aging and neurodegeneration in mice, and are upregulated in pathologically        affected brain regions in AD. Taken together, our data-driven findings from        multiple publicly accessible datasets reemphasize the importance of microglial        gene expression alterations in AD and, more importantly, suggest that regional        and sex-specific variation in microglial gene expression may be implicated in        risk for and progression of neurodegenerative disease.",0edd64265ed348d6d0b4b83994b5586de7170409,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0edd64265ed348d6d0b4b83994b5586de7170409,31214167,PMC6557985,,False,Frontiers in immunology,101560960

Deletion of        Rev-erbα resulted in microglial as well as astrocytic activation, while a        Rev-erbα agonist diminished the severity of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced        neuroinflammation. Concomitant with this glial activation is impaired neuronal        health. These findings suggest that Rev-erb proteins may play critical roles in        glial biology. Pertinent ideas such as the glial cell type of most importance,        the translatability of these findings to human disease, and the effect of        manipulating Rev-erbs in models of neurodegeneration, need to be explored        further.

Many mutations in the amyloid        precursor protein (APP) and presenilin 1 and 2 (PSEN1 and PSEN2) have been        reported as the pathogenic causes of early-onset AD (EOAD), which accounts for up        to 5% of all AD cases. In this study, we screened familiar/de novo EOAD (n = 67)        samples by next-generation sequencing (NGS) of a 50-gene panel, which included        causative and possible pathogenic variants linked to neurodegenerative disorders.        Remarkably, three missense mutations in PSEN1 (T119I, G209A, and G417A) and one        known variant in PSEN2 (H169N) were discovered in 6% of the cases. Additionally,        67 missense mutations in susceptibility genes for late-onset AD were identified,        which may be involved in cholesterol transport, inflammatory response, and        β-amyloid modulation. We identified 70 additional novel and missense variants in        other genes, such as MAPT, GRN, CSF1R, and PRNP, related to neurodegenerative        diseases, which may represent overlapping clinical and neuropathological features        with AD. Extensive genetic screening of Korean patients with EOAD identified        multiple rare variants with potential roles in AD pathogenesis. This study        suggests that individuals diagnosed with AD should be screened for other        neurodegenerative disease-associated genes. Our findings expand the classic set        of genes involved in neurodegenerative pathogenesis, which should be screened for        in clinical trials. Main limitation of this study was the absence of functional        assessment for possibly and probably pathogenic variants. Additional issues were        that we could not perform studies on copy number variants, and we could not        verify the segregation of mutations.",649fa45142a9ad2209b9090b341873f16ec2c9a8,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/649fa45142a9ad2209b9090b341873f16ec2c9a8,31182772,PMC6557896,,False,Scientific reports,101563288
10.4103/1673-5374.257511,Physiological effects of amyloid precursor protein and its derivatives on neural stem cell biology and signaling pathways involved,2019.0,"The pathological implication of amyloid precursor protein (APP) in Alzheimer's        disease has been widely documented due to its involvement in the generation of        amyloid-β peptide. However, the physiological functions of APP are still poorly        understood. APP is considered a multimodal protein due to its role in a wide        variety of processes, both in the embryo and in the adult brain. Specifically,        APP seems to play a key role in the proliferation, differentiation and maturation        of neural stem cells. In addition, APP can be processed through two canonical        processing pathways, generating different functionally active fragments: soluble        APP-α, soluble APP-β, amyloid-β peptide and the APP intracellular C-terminal        domain. These fragments also appear to modulate various functions in neural stem        cells, including the processes of proliferation, neurogenesis, gliogenesis or        cell death. However, the molecular mechanisms involved in these effects are still        unclear. In this review, we summarize the physiological functions of APP and its        main proteolytic derivatives in neural stem cells, as well as the possible        signaling pathways that could be implicated in these effects. The knowledge of        these functions and signaling pathways involved in the onset or during the        development of Alzheimer's disease is essential to advance the understanding of        the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease, and in the search for potential        therapeutic targets.",6db6c6368797dffdb1ec6e7865ace7d2034791fd,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/6db6c6368797dffdb1ec6e7865ace7d2034791fd,31169172,PMC6585543,background,False,Neural regeneration research,101316351
10.3389/fnagi.2019.00101,Transcriptional Dysregulation Study Reveals a Core Network Involving the Progression of Alzheimer's Disease,2019.0,"Background: The pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease is associated with        dysregulation at different levels from transcriptome to cellular functioning.        Such complexity necessitates investigations of disease etiology to be carried out        considering multiple aspects of the disease and the use of independent        strategies. The established works more emphasized on the structural organization        of gene regulatory network while neglecting the internal regulation changes.        Methods: Applying a strategy different from popularly used co-expression network        analysis, this study investigated the transcriptional dysregulations during the        transition from normal to disease states. Results: Ninety- seven genes were        predicted as dysregulated genes, which were also associated with clinical        outcomes of Alzheimer's disease. Both the co-expression and differential        co-expression analysis suggested these genes to be interconnected as a core        network and that their regulations were strengthened during the transition to        disease states. Functional studies suggested the dysregulated genes to be        associated with aging and synaptic function. Further, we checked the conservation        of the gene co-expression and found that human and mouse brain might have        divergent transcriptional co-regulation even when they had conserved gene        expression profiles. Conclusion: Overall, our study reveals a core network of        transcriptional dysregulation associated with the progression of Alzheimer's        disease by affecting the aging and synaptic functions related genes; the gene        regulation is not conserved in the human and mouse brains.",2c923d195859a3323457d5e5a5b86324efe0f664,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/2c923d195859a3323457d5e5a5b86324efe0f664,31133844,PMC6513962,background,False,Frontiers in aging neuroscience,101525824
10.3389/fnins.2019.00446,Exploring the Pathogenesis of Alzheimer Disease in Basal Forebrain Cholinergic Neurons: Converging Insights From Alternative Hypotheses,2019.0,"Alzheimer disease (AD) represents an oncoming epidemic that without an effective        treatment promises to exact extraordinary financial and emotional burdens        (Apostolova, 2016). Studies of pathogenesis are essential for defining critical        molecular and cellular events and for discovering therapies to prevent or        mitigate their effects. Through studies of neuropathology, genetic and cellular,        and molecular biology recent decades have provided many important insights.        Several hypotheses have been suggested. Documentation in the 1980s of selective        loss of cholinergic neurons of the basal forebrain, followed by clinical        improvement in those treated with inhibitors of acetylycholinesterase, supported        the ""cholinergic hypothesis of age-related cognitive dysfunction"" (Bartus et al.,        1982). A second hypothesis, prompted by the selective loss of cholinergic neurons        and the discovery of central nervous system (CNS) neurotrophic factors, including        nerve growth factor (NGF), prompted the ""deficient neurotrophic hypothesis"" (Chen        et al., 2018). The most persuasive hypothesis, the amyloid cascade hypothesis        first proposed more than 25 years ago (Selkoe and Hardy, 2016), is supported by a        wealth of observations. Genetic studies were exceptionally important, pointing to        increased dose of the gene for the amyloid precursor protein (APP) in Down        syndrome (DS) and a familial AD (FAD) due to duplication of APP and to mutations        in APP and in the genes for Presenilin 1 and 2 (PSEN1, 2), which encode the        γ-secretase enzyme that processes APP (Dorszewska et al., 2016). The ""tau        hypothesis"" noted the prominence of tau-related pathology and its correlation        with dementia (Kametani and Hasegawa, 2018). Recent interest in induction of        microglial activation in the AD brain, as well as other manifestations of        inflammation, supports the ""inflammatory hypothesis"" (Mcgeer et al., 2016). We        place these findings in the context of the selective, but by no means unique,        involvement of BFCNs and their trophic dependence on NGF signaling and speculate        as to how pathogenesis in these neurons is initiated, amplified and ultimately        results in their dysfunction and death. In so doing we attempt to show how the        different hypotheses for AD may interact and reinforce one another. Finally, we        address current attempts to prevent and/or treat AD in light of advances in        understanding pathogenetic mechanisms and suggest that studies in the DS        population may provide unique insights into AD pathogenesis and treatment.",c354c0ea3d499cb743b7433d0ed2f7b1c69db9fd,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/c354c0ea3d499cb743b7433d0ed2f7b1c69db9fd,31133787,PMC6514132,,False,Frontiers in neuroscience,101478481

Recent research has identified        specific microglial interactions with amyloid plaques that exert important        protective functions including attenuation of early pathology. It is unknown how        these protective microglial interactions with plaques are affected by        apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotype and sex, two well-established AD risk factors        that modulate microglial function. We investigated this question using        quantitative confocal microscopy to compare microglial interactions with amyloid        plaques in male and female EFAD mice across APOE3 and APOE4 genotypes at 6 months        of age. We observed that microglial coverage of plaques is highest in male APOE3        mice with significant reductions in coverage observed with both APOE4 genotype        and female sex. Plaque compaction, a beneficial consequence of microglial        interactions with plaques, showed a similar pattern in which APOE4 genotype and        female sex were associated with significantly lower values. Within the plaque        environment, microglial expression of triggering receptor expressed on myeloid        cells 2 (TREM2), a known regulator of microglial plaque coverage, was highest in        male APOE3 mice and reduced by APOE4 genotype and female sex. These differences        in plaque interactions were unrelated to the number of microglial processes in        the plaque environment across groups. Interestingly, the pattern of amyloid        burden across groups was opposite to that of microglial plaque coverage, with        APOE4 genotype and female sex showing the highest amyloid levels. These findings        suggest a possible mechanism by which microglia may contribute to the increased        AD risk associated with APOE4 genotype and female sex.",421623175e69276a6089694be88fc3dc6d99cee3,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/421623175e69276a6089694be88fc3dc6d99cee3,31113487,PMC6528326,,False,Acta neuropathologica communications,101610673

The        underlying mechanism that links up the two conditions seems to be the        de-sensitization of insulin signaling. In patients with AD, insulin signaling was        found to be de-sensitized in the brain, even if they did not have diabetes.        Insulin is an important growth factor that regulates cell growth, energy        utilization, mitochondrial function and replacement, autophagy, oxidative stress        management, synaptic plasticity, and cognitive function. Insulin desensitization,        therefore, can enhance the risk of developing neurological disorders in later        life. Other risk factors, such as high blood pressure or brain injury, also        enhance the likelihood of developing AD. All these risk factors have one thing in        common - they induce a chronic inflammation response in the brain.        Pro-inflammatory cytokines block growth factor signaling and enhance oxidative        stress. The underlying molecular processes for this are described in the review.        Treatments to re-sensitize insulin signaling in the brain are also described,        such as nasal insulin tests in AD patients, or treatments with re-sensitizing        hormones, such as leptin, ghrelin, glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1),and        glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP).

Early pathological        changes, such as marked enlargement of endosomal compartments, gradual        accumulation of autophagic vacuoles (AVs) and lysosome dyshomeostasis, are        well-recognized in AD. In addition to these pathological indicators, many genetic        variants of key regulators in the endo-lysosomal autophagy networks and the        ubiquitin-proteasome system have been found to be associated with AD.        Furthermore, altered expression levels of key proteins in these pathways have        been found in AD human brain tissues, primary cells and AD mouse models. In this        review, we discuss potential disease mechanisms underlying the dysregulation of        protein homeostasis governing systems. While the importance of two major protein        degradation pathways in AD pathogenesis has been highlighted, targeted therapy at        key components of these pathways has great potential in developing novel        therapeutic interventions for AD. Future investigations are needed to define        molecular mechanisms by which these complex regulatory systems become        malfunctional at specific stages of AD development and progression, which will        facilitate future development of novel therapeutic interventions.

Complement        proteins, regulators, and receptors are widely expressed throughout the CNS and,        in many cases, are upregulated in disease. Genetic and epidemiological studies,        cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and plasma biomarker measurements and pathological        analysis of post-mortem tissues have all implicated complement in multiple CNS        diseases including multiple sclerosis (MS), neuromyelitis optica (NMO),        neurotrauma, stroke, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Alzheimer's disease        (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), and Huntington's disease (HD). Given this body of        evidence implicating complement in diverse brain diseases, manipulating        complement in the brain is an attractive prospect; however, the blood-brain        barrier (BBB), critical to protect the brain from potentially harmful agents in        the circulation, is also impermeable to current complement-targeting        therapeutics, making drug design much more challenging. For example, antibody        therapeutics administered systemically are essentially excluded from the brain.        Recent protocols have utilized ""Trojan horse"" techniques to transport        therapeutics across the BBB or used osmotic shock or ultrasound to temporarily        disrupt the BBB. Most research to date exploring the impact of complement        inhibition on CNS diseases has been in animal models, and some of these studies        have generated convincing data; for example, in models of MS, NMO, and stroke.        There have been a few recent clinical trials of available anti-complement drugs        in CNS diseases associated with BBB impairment, for example the use of the        anti-C5 monoclonal antibody (mAb) eculizumab in NMO, but for most CNS diseases        there have been no human trials of anti-complement therapies.

In this        study, we used paired-end short-read and direct long-read whole genome sequencing        to investigate an unresolved autosomal dominant dementia family significantly        linked to 7q36. We identified and validated a chromosomal inversion of ca. 4 Mb,        segregating on the disease haplotype and disrupting the coding sequence of        dipeptidyl-peptidase 6 gene (DPP6). DPP6 resequencing identified significantly        more rare variants-nonsense, frameshift, and missense-in early-onset Alzheimer's        disease (EOAD, p value = 0.03, OR = 2.21 95% CI 1.05-4.82) and frontotemporal        dementia (FTD, p = 0.006, OR = 2.59, 95% CI 1.28-5.49) patient cohorts. DPP6 is a        type II transmembrane protein with a highly structured extracellular domain and        is mainly expressed in brain, where it binds to the potassium channel K(v)4.2        enhancing its expression, regulating its gating properties and controlling the        dendritic excitability of hippocampal neurons. Using in vitro modeling, we showed        that the missense variants found in patients destabilize DPP6 and reduce its        membrane expression (p < 0.001 and p < 0.0001) leading to a loss of protein.        Reduced DPP6 and/or K(v)4.2 expression was also detected in brain tissue of        missense variant carriers. Loss of DPP6 is known to cause neuronal        hyperexcitability and behavioral alterations in Dpp6-KO mice. Taken together, the        results of our genomic, genetic, expression and modeling analyses, provided        direct evidence supporting the involvement of DPP6 loss in dementia. We propose        that loss of function variants have a higher penetrance and disease impact,        whereas the missense variants have a variable risk contribution to disease that        can vary from high to low penetrance.

With a prominent extracellular chaperone function,        additional roles have been discussed for clusterin, including lipid transport and        immune modulation, and it is involved in pathways common to several diseases such        as cell death and survival, oxidative stress, and proteotoxic stress. Although        clusterin is normally a secreted protein, it has also been found intracellularly        under certain stress conditions. Multiple hypotheses have been proposed regarding        the origin of intracellular clusterin, including specific biogenic processes        leading to alternative transcripts and protein isoforms, but these lines of        research are incomplete and contradictory. Current consensus is that        intracellular clusterin is most likely to have exited the secretory pathway at        some point or to have re-entered the cell after secretion. Clusterin's        relationship with amyloid beta (Aβ) has been of great interest to the AD field,        including clusterin's apparent role in altering Aβ aggregation and/or clearance.        Additionally, clusterin has been more recently identified as a mediator of Aβ        toxicity, as evidenced by the neuroprotective effect of CLU knockdown and        knockout in rodent and human iPSC-derived neurons. CLU is also the third most        significant genetic risk factor for late onset AD and several variants have been        identified in CLU. Although the exact contribution of these variants to altered        AD risk is unclear, some have been linked to altered CLU expression at both mRNA        and protein levels, altered cognitive and memory function, and altered brain        structure. The apparent complexity of clusterin's biogenesis, the lack of clarity        over the origin of the intracellular clusterin species, and the number of        pathophysiological functions attributed to clusterin have all contributed to the        challenge of understanding the role of clusterin in AD pathophysiology. Here, we        highlight clusterin's relevance to AD by discussing the evidence linking        clusterin to AD, as well as drawing parallels on how the role of clusterin in        other diseases and pathways may help us understand its biological function(s) in        association with AD.",4a257d03d61b3cdf262beccc01a53abd99e2fc2c,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/4a257d03d61b3cdf262beccc01a53abd99e2fc2c,30872998,PMC6403191,,False,Frontiers in neuroscience,101478481

METHODS: A population resource including a        genealogy of Utah pioneers from the 1800s linked to Utah death certificates was        used to estimate relative risk for AD based on specific family history        constellations, including from first- to third-degree relatives. RESULTS: Any        affected first-degree relatives (FDR) significantly increased risk of AD (≥1        FDRs: relative risk [RR] 1.73, 95% confidence interval [CI] [1.59-1.87]; ≥2 FDRs:        RR 3.98 [3.26-4.82]; ≥3 FDRs: RR 2.48 [1.07-4.89]; ≥4 FDRs: RR 14.77        [5.42-32.15]). Affected second-degree relatives (SDR) increased risk even in the        presence of affected FDRs (FDR = 1 with SDR = 2: RR 21.29 [5.80-54.52]). AD only        in third-degree relatives (TDR) also increased risk (FDR = 0, SDR = 0, TDR ≥3: RR        1.43 [1.21-1.68]). Mixed evidence was observed for differences in risk based on        maternal compared to paternal inheritance; higher risks for men than women with        equivalent family history, and higher risk for individuals with at least one        affected FDR regardless of the relative's age at death, were observed.        CONCLUSIONS: This population-based estimation of RRs for AD based on family        history ascertained from extended genealogy data indicates that inherited genetic        factors have a broad influence, extending beyond immediate relatives.

10.1212/CON.0000000000000687,Early-onset Alzheimer Disease and Its Variants,2019.0,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Early-onset Alzheimer disease (AD) is defined as having an age        of onset younger than 65 years. While early-onset AD is often overshadowed by the        more common late-onset AD, recognition of the differences between early- and        late-onset AD is important for clinicians. RECENT FINDINGS: Early-onset AD        comprises about 5% to 6% of cases of AD and includes a substantial percentage of        phenotypic variants that differ from the usual amnestic presentation of typical        AD. Characteristics of early-onset AD in comparison to late-onset AD include a        larger genetic predisposition (familial mutations and summed polygenic risk),        more aggressive course, more frequent delay in diagnosis, higher prevalence of        traumatic brain injury, less memory impairment and greater involvement of other        cognitive domains on presentation, and greater psychosocial difficulties.        Neuroimaging features of early-onset AD in comparison to late-onset AD include        greater frequency of hippocampal sparing and posterior neocortical atrophy,        increased tau burden, and greater connectomic changes affecting frontoparietal        networks rather than the default mode network. SUMMARY: Early-onset AD differs        substantially from late-onset AD, with different phenotypic presentations,        greater genetic predisposition, and differences in neuropathologic burden and        topography. Early-onset AD more often presents with nonamnestic phenotypic        variants that spare the hippocampi and with greater tau burden in posterior        neocortices. The early-onset AD phenotypic variants involve different neural        networks than typical AD. The management of early-onset AD is similar to that of        late-onset AD but with special emphasis on targeting specific cognitive areas and        more age-appropriate psychosocial support and education.",af89c22bc4e33156682a4d82185055009a6261e4,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/af89c22bc4e33156682a4d82185055009a6261e4,30707186,PMC6538053,,False,"Continuum (Minneapolis, Minn.)",9509333

Here, we review the        possible genetic, molecular, and functional role of RAB10 in AD and potential        therapeutic approaches to target RAB10.",903fe57928b1ed6adfd483cda144ca9257b9cac3,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/903fe57928b1ed6adfd483cda144ca9257b9cac3,30643396,PMC6312396,background,True,Clinical interventions in aging,101273480

The two        histopathological markers of AD are amyloid plaques composed of the amyloid-β        (Aβ) peptide, and neurofibrillary tangles of aggregated, abnormally        hyperphosphorylated tau protein. The majority of AD cases are late-onset, after        the age of 65, where a clear cause is still unknown. However, there are likely        different multifactorial contributors including age, enviornment, biology and        genetics which can increase risk for the disease. Genetic predisposition is        considerable, with heritability estimates of 60-80%. Genetic factors such as rare        variants of TREM2 (triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells-2) strongly        increase the risk of developing AD, confirming the role of microglia in AD        pathogenesis. In the last 5 years, several studies have dissected the mechanisms        by which TREM2, as well as its rare variants affect amyloid and tau pathologies        and their consequences in both animal models and in human studies.

Furthermore, it is not clear how murine gene        expression changes relate to human gene expression networks. METHODS: Microglia        cells were isolated from rTg4510 tau transgenic mice and gene expression was        profiled using RNA sequencing. Four age groups of mice (2-, 4-, 6-, and 8-months)        were analyzed to capture longitudinal gene expression changes that correspond to        varying levels of pathology, from minimal tau accumulation to massive neuronal        loss. Statistical and system biology approaches were used to analyze the genes        and pathways that underlie microglia activation. Differentially expressed genes        were compared to human brain co-expression networks. RESULTS: Statistical        analysis of RNAseq data indicated that more than 4000 genes were differentially        expressed in rTg4510 microglia compared to wild type microglia, with the majority        of gene expression changes occurring between 2- and 4-months of age. These genes        belong to four major clusters based on their temporal expression pattern. Genes        involved in innate immunity were continuously up-regulated, whereas genes        involved in the glutamatergic synapse were down-regulated. Up-regulated innate        inflammatory pathways included NF-κB signaling, cytokine-cytokine receptor        interaction, lysosome, oxidative phosphorylation, and phagosome. NF-κB and        cytokine signaling were among the earliest pathways activated, likely driven by        the RELA, STAT1 and STAT6 transcription factors. The expression of many AD        associated genes such as APOE and TREM2 was also altered in rTg4510 microglia        cells.

Here, we show that the        risk factor Pyk2 (PTK2B) localizes specifically to neurons in adult brain.        Absence of Pyk2 has no major effect on synapse formation or the basal parameters        of synaptic transmission in the hippocampal Schaffer collateral pathway. However,        the induction of synaptic LTD is suppressed in Pyk2-null slices. In contrast,        deletion of Pyk2 expression does not alter LTP under control conditions. Of        relevance for AD pathophysiology, Pyk2(-/-) slices are protected from        amyloid-β-oligomer (Aβo)-induced suppression of LTP in hippocampal slices.        Acutely, a Pyk2 kinase inhibitor also prevents Aβo-induced suppression of LTP in        WT slices. Female and male transgenic AD model mice expressing APPswe/PSEN1ΔE9        require Pyk2 for age-dependent loss of synaptic markers and for impairment of        learning and memory.

A        bioinformatics survey showed that AD genome-wide association study (GWAS) genes        (localized in bone marrow, immune locations and microglia) relate to multiple        host/pathogen interactomes (Candida albicans, Cryptococcus neoformans,        Bornavirus, Borrelia burgdorferri, cytomegalovirus, Ebola virus, HSV-1, HERV-W,        HIV-1, Epstein-Barr, hepatitis C, influenza, Chlamydia pneumoniae, Porphyrymonas        gingivalis, Helicobacter pylori, Toxoplasma gondii, Trypanosoma cruzi). These        interactomes also relate to the AD hippocampal transcriptome and to plaque or        tangle proteins. Upregulated AD hippocampal genes match those upregulated by        multiple bacteria, viruses, fungi, or protozoa in immunocompetent cells. AD genes        are enriched in GWAS datasets reflecting pathogen diversity, suggesting selection        for pathogen resistance, as supported by the old age of AD patients, implying        resistance to earlier infections.

Age is the most significant risk factor for AD, whereas other risk        factors correlated with AD are hypercholesterolemia, hypertension,        atherosclerosis, coronary heart disease, smoking, obesity, and diabetes. Despite        decades of research, there is no satisfying therapy which will terminate the        advancement of AD by acting on the origin of the disease process, whereas        currently available therapeutics only provide symptomatic relief but fail to        attain a definite cure and prevention.

Early Life Stress (ELS) rodent models have successfully demonstrated        sequelae of maternal separation resulting in LOAD-analogous pathology, thereby        supporting a role of insulin receptor signalling pertaining to GSK-3beta        facilitated tau hyper-phosphorylation and amyloidogenic processing. Discussed are        relevant ELS studies, and findings from three mitogen-activated protein kinase        pathways (JNK/SAPK pathway, ERK pathway, p38/MAPK pathway) relevant for mediating        environmental stresses. Further considered were the roles of autophagy        impairment, neuroinflammation, and brain insulin resistance. For the        meta-analytic evaluation, 224 candidate gene loci were extracted from reviews of        animal studies of LOAD pathophysiological mechanisms, of which 60 had no positive        results in human LOAD association studies. These loci were combined with 89 gene        loci confirmed as LOAD risk genes in previous GWAS and WES. Of the 313 risk gene        loci evaluated, there were 35 human reports on epigenomic modifications in terms        of methylation or histone acetylation. 64 microRNA gene regulation mechanisms        were published for the compiled loci. Genomic association studies support close        relations of both noradrenergic and glucocorticoid systems with LOAD. For HPA        involvement, a CRHR1 haplotype with MAPT was described, but further association        of only HSD11B1 with LOAD found; however, association of FKBP1 and NC3R1        polymorphisms was documented in support of stress influence to LOAD. In the brain        insulin system, IGF2R, INSR, INSRR, and plasticity regulator ARC, were associated        with LOAD. Pertaining to compromised myelin stability in LOAD, relevant        associations were found for BIN1, RELN, SORL1, SORCS1, CNP, MAG, and MOG.        Regarding epigenetic modifications, both methylation variability and        de-acetylation were reported for LOAD. The majority of up-to-date epigenomic        findings include reported modifications in the well-known LOAD core pathology        loci MAPT, BACE1, APP (with FOS, EGR1), PSEN1, PSEN2, and highlight a central        role of BDNF. Pertaining to ELS, relevant loci are FKBP5, EGR1, GSK3B; critical        roles of inflammation are indicated by CRP, TNFA, NFKB1 modifications; for        cholesterol biosynthesis, DHCR24; for myelin stability BIN1, SORL1, CNP;        pertaining to (epi)genetic mechanisms, hTERT, MBD2, DNMT1, MTHFR2.

10.3389/fnins.2018.00699,The Molecular and Neuropathological Consequences of Genetic Risk for Alzheimer's Dementia,2018.0,"Alzheimer's dementia commonly impacts the health of older adults and lacks any        preventative therapy. While Alzheimer's dementia risk has a substantial genetic        component, the specific molecular mechanisms and neuropathologies triggered by        most of the known genetic variants are unclear. Resultantly, they have shown        limited influence on drug development portfolios to date. To facilitate our        understanding of the consequences of Alzheimer's dementia susceptibility        variants, we examined their relationship to a wide range of clinical, molecular        and neuropathological features. Because the effect size of individual variants is        typically small, we utilized a polygenic (overall) risk approach to identify the        global impact of Alzheimer's dementia susceptibility variants. Under this        approach, each individual has a polygenic risk score (PRS) that we related to        clinical, molecular and neuropathological phenotypes. Applying this approach to        1,272 individuals who came to autopsy from one of two longitudinal aging cohorts,        we observed that an individual's PRS was associated with cognitive decline and        brain pathologies including beta-amyloid, tau-tangles, hippocampal sclerosis, and        TDP-43, MIR132, four proteins including VGF, IGFBP5, and STX1A, and many        chromosomal regions decorated with acetylation on histone H3 lysine 9 (H3K9Ac).        While excluding the APOE/TOMM40 region (containing the single largest genetic        risk factor for late-onset Alzheimer's dementia) in the calculation of the PRS        resulted in a slightly weaker association with the molecular signatures, results        remained significant. These PRS-associated brain pathologies and molecular        signatures appear to mediate genetic risk, as they attenuated the association of        the PRS with cognitive decline. Notably, the PRS induced changes in H3K9Ac        throughout the genome, implicating it in large-scale chromatin changes. Thus, the        PRS for Alzheimer's dementia (AD-PRS) showed effects on diverse clinical,        molecular, and pathological systems, ranging from the epigenome to specific        proteins. These convergent targets of a large number of genetic risk factors for        Alzheimer's dementia will help define the experimental systems and models needed        to test therapeutic targets, which are expected to be broadly effective in the        aging population that carries diverse genetic risks for Alzheimer's dementia.",1fa317093d8728e82cdda9c4207b1760db3cfbba,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/1fa317093d8728e82cdda9c4207b1760db3cfbba,30349450,PMC6187226,,False,Frontiers in neuroscience,101478481

By now,        there is ample evidence that activated microglia have a critical role in the        initiation and progression of AD.

With virtually no        success at finding pharmaceutical therapeutics for altering progressive AD after        diagnosis, research attention is increasingly directed at discovering biological        and other markers that detect AD risk in the long asymptomatic phase. Both early        detection and precision preclinical intervention require systematic investigation        of multiple modalities and combinations of AD-related biomarkers and risk        factors. We extend recent unbiased metabolomics research that produced a set of        metabolite biomarker panels tailored to the discrimination of cognitively normal        (CN), cognitively impaired and AD patients. Specifically, we compare the        prediction importance of these panels with five other sets of modifiable and        non-modifiable AD risk factors (genetic, lifestyle, cognitive, functional health        and bio-demographic) in three clinical groups. Method: The three groups were: CN        (n = 35), mild cognitive impairment (MCI; n = 25), and AD (n = 22). In a series        of three pairwise comparisons, we used machine learning technology random forest        analysis (RFA) to test relative predictive importance of up to 19 risk biomarkers        from the six AD risk domains. Results: The three RFA multimodal prediction        analyses produced significant discriminating risk factors. First, discriminating        AD from CN was the AD metabolite panel and two cognitive markers. Second,        discriminating AD from MCI was the AD/MCI metabolite panel and two cognitive        markers. Third, discriminating MCI from CN was the MCI metabolite panel and seven        markers from four other risk modalities: genetic, lifestyle, cognition and        functional health. Conclusions: Salivary metabolomics biomarker panels,        supplemented by other risk markers, were robust predictors of: (1) clinical        differences in impairment and dementia and even; (2) subtle differences between        CN and MCI. For the latter, the metabolite panel was supplemented by biomarkers        that were both modifiable (e.g., functional) and non-modifiable (e.g., genetic).        Comparing, integrating and identifying important multi-modal predictors may lead        to novel combinations of complex risk profiles potentially indicative of        neuropathological changes in asymptomatic or preclinical AD.",481827896a2718142ef78108c6774397a4aabfb5,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/481827896a2718142ef78108c6774397a4aabfb5,30333744,PMC6175993,,False,Frontiers in aging neuroscience,101525824

Numerous neuroimaging studies have suggested that the modulation of        APOE ε4 affects intrinsic functional brain networks, both in healthy populations        and in AD patients. However, it remains largely unclear whether and how ε4 allele        modulates the brain's functional network architecture in subjects with aMCI.        Using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and graph-theory        approaches-functional connectivity strength (FCS), we investigate the topological        organization of the whole-brain functional network in 28 aMCI ε4 carriers and 38        aMCI ε3ε3 carriers. In the present study, we first observe that ε4-related FCS        increases in the right hippocampus/parahippocampal gyrus (HIP/PHG). Subsequent        seed-based resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) analysis revealed that,        compared with the ε3ε3 carriers, the ε4 carriers had lower or higher RSFCs        between the right HIP/PHG seed and the bilateral medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC)        or the occipital cortex, respectively. Further correlation analyses have revealed        that the FCS values in the right HIP/PHG and lower HIP/PHG-RSFCs with the        bilateral MPFC were significantly correlated with the impairment of episodic        memory and executive function in the aMCI ε4 carriers. Importantly, the logistic        regression analysis showed that the HIP/PHG-RSFC with the bilateral MPFC        predicted aMCI-conversion to AD. These findings suggest that the APOE ε4 allele        may modulate the large-scale brain network in aMCI subjects, facilitating our        understanding of how the entire assembly of the brain network reorganizes in        response to APOE variants in aMCI.

Cortical neurons were stimulated with        20 µM of Aβ(25-35) for 24 h to construct AD model in vitro. qRT-PCR assay was        used to detect the expression of miR-429, and qRT-PCR or western blot analysis        were performed to assess the levels of Sex-determining region Y-box 2 (SOX2) and        B cell lymphoma-2 protein (BCL2) at mRNA or proteins levels in the AD mouse model        and Aβ-induced treated cortical neurons. Luciferase reporter assay and western        blot analysis were used to confirm the potential targets of miR-429. CCK-8 assay,        flow cytometry analysis, and caspase3 activity assay were used to measure cell        viability, cell apoptosis capacity and caspase3 activity, respectively. MiR-429        was upregulated and SOX2 and BCL2 were downregulated in the AD mouse model and        Aβ-induced mouse cortical neurons. MiR-429 knockdown attenuated Aβ-induced        cytotoxicity in mouse cortical neurons. SOX2 and BCL2 were direct targets of        miR-429. Moreover, anti-miR-429-mediated neuroprotective effect was abated by the        restoration of SOX2 or BCL2 expression. Knockdown of miR-429 might attenuate        Aβ-induced cytotoxicity by targeting SOX2 and BCL2 in mouse cortical neurons,        providing a novel prospect in AD therapy.",edcde5713696ca59ae1fb944a97ab296a3afbb84,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/edcde5713696ca59ae1fb944a97ab296a3afbb84,30264333,,,False,Neurochemical research,7613461

METHODS: For 2907 stroke-free older individuals, we examined the        association of polygenic risk scores for AD dementia (ADPRSs) with vascular        pathologies and with cognition. Mediation analyses addressed whether association        between ADPRSs and cognition was mediated by a vascular pathology. RESULTS:        ADPRSs were associated with lobar cerebral microbleeds, white matter lesion load,        and coronary artery calcification, mostly explained by single nucleotide        polymorphisms in the 19q13 region. The effect of ADPRSs on cognition was        partially but significantly mediated by cerebral microbleeds, white matter        lesions, and coronary artery calcification. DISCUSSION: Our findings provide        evidence for genetic overlap, mostly due to apolipoprotein E (APOE) gene, between        vascular pathologies and AD dementia. The association between AD polygenic risk        and late-life cognition is mediated in part via effects on vascular pathologies.",49598e9f5fcdd17683a3ca18e4be8b3a9deb0973,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/49598e9f5fcdd17683a3ca18e4be8b3a9deb0973,30240575,PMC6435328,result,False,Alzheimer's & dementia : the journal of the Alzheimer's Association,101231978

Here, we explore whether a decoy receptor strategy using the        ectodomain of select TLRs has therapeutic potential in AD. AAV-mediated        expression of human TLR5 ectodomain (sTLR5) alone or fused to human IgG4 Fc        (sTLR5Fc) results in robust attenuation of amyloid β (Aβ) accumulation in a mouse        model of Alzheimer-type Aβ pathology. sTLR5Fc binds to oligomeric and fibrillar        Aβ with high affinity, forms complexes with Aβ, and blocks Aβ toxicity.        Oligomeric and fibrillar Aβ modulates flagellin-mediated activation of human TLR5        but does not, by itself, activate TLR5 signaling. Genetic analysis shows that        rare protein coding variants in human TLR5 may be associated with a reduced risk        of AD. Further, transcriptome analysis shows altered TLR gene expression in human        AD.

In an        effort to identify the independent genetic risk factors for NFTs and Aβ, we        investigated genotypic frequencies of AD susceptibility loci between        autopsy-confirmed AD and primary age-related tauopathy (PART), a        neuropathological condition defined by characteristic neurofibrillary tau tangles        (NFTs) with minimal or absent Aβ. METHODS: General linear models assessed the        odds of AD (N = 1190) relative to PART (N = 376) neuropathologically confirmed        cases from two independent series: the Penn Brain Bank (PENN; AD N = 312; PART N        = 65) and National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center (NACC; AD N = 878; PART N =        311).

Clinically, attempts to understand AD have focused on trying        to predict the presence of, and more recently demonstrate the presence of, its        characteristic amyloid plaque and neurofibrillary tangle pathologies. Fundamental        research has also traditionally focused on understanding the generation, content,        and pathogenicity of plaques and tangles, but in addition to this there is now an        emerging independent interest in other molecular phenomena including        apolipoprotein E, lipid metabolism, neuroinflammation, and mitochondrial        function.

10.1038/s41386-018-0144-3,Genetic association of the cytochrome c oxidase-related genes with Alzheimer’s disease in Han Chinese,2018.0,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia. Mitochondrial        dysfunction has been widely reported in AD due to its important role in cellular        metabolism and energy production. Complex IV (cytochrome c oxidase, COX) of        mitochondrial electron transport chain, is particularly vulnerable in AD. Defects        of COX in AD have been well documented, but there is little evidence to support        the genetic association of the COX-related genes with AD. In this study, we        investigated the genetic association between 17 nuclear-encoded COX-related genes        and AD in 1572 Han Chinese. The whole exons of these genes were also screened in        107 unrelated AD patients with a high probability of hereditarily transmitted AD.        Variants in COX6B1, NDUFA4, SURF1, and COX10 were identified to be associated        with AD. An integrative analysis with data of eQTL, expression and pathology        revealed that most of the COX-related genes were significantly downregulated in        AD patients and mouse models, and the AD-associated variants in COX6B1, SURF1,        and COX10 were linked to altered mRNA levels in brain tissues. Furthermore, mRNA        levels of Ndufa4, Cox5a, Cox10, Cox6b2, Cox7a2, and Lrpprc were significantly        correlated with Aβ plaque burden in hippocampus of AD mice.

10.1073/pnas.1801612115,Amyloid clearance defect in ApoE4 astrocytes is reversed by epigenetic correction of endosomal pH,2018.0,"Endosomes have emerged as a central hub and pathogenic driver of Alzheimer's        disease (AD). The earliest brain cytopathology in neurodegeneration, occurring        decades before amyloid plaques and cognitive decline, is an expansion in the size        and number of endosomal compartments. The strongest genetic risk factor for        sporadic AD is the ε4 allele of Apolipoprotein E (ApoE4). Previous studies have        shown that ApoE4 potentiates presymptomatic endosomal dysfunction and defective        endocytic clearance of amyloid beta (Aβ), although how these two pathways are        linked at a cellular and mechanistic level has been unclear. Here, we show that        aberrant endosomal acidification in ApoE4 astrocytes traps the low-density        lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP1) within intracellular compartments,        leading to loss of surface expression and Aβ clearance. Pathological endosome        acidification is caused by ε4 risk allele-selective down-regulation of the        Na(+)/H(+) exchanger isoform NHE6, which functions as a critical leak pathway for        endosomal protons. In vivo, the NHE6 knockout (NHE6(KO)) mouse model showed        elevated Aβ in the brain, consistent with a causal effect. Increased nuclear        translocation of histone deacetylase 4 (HDAC4) in ApoE4 astrocytes, compared with        the nonpathogenic ApoE3 allele, suggested a mechanistic basis for transcriptional        down-regulation of NHE6. HDAC inhibitors that restored NHE6 expression normalized        ApoE4-specific defects in endosomal pH, LRP1 trafficking, and amyloid clearance.        Thus, NHE6 is a downstream effector of ApoE4 and emerges as a promising        therapeutic target in AD. These observations have prognostic implications for        patients who have Christianson syndrome with loss of function mutations in NHE6        and exhibit prominent glial pathology and progressive hallmarks of        neurodegeneration.",6df1477984f5b1d0b945833f66e04a624dbbb0a5,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/6df1477984f5b1d0b945833f66e04a624dbbb0a5,29946028,PMC6048470,background,False,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876

In fact,        currently, there are no effective pharmacological treatments for AD. Integrative        strategies such as transcription regulatory network and master regulator analyses        exemplify promising new approaches to study complex diseases and may help in the        identification of potential pharmacological targets. METHODS: In this study, we        used transcription regulatory network and master regulator analyses on        transcriptomic data of human hippocampus to identify transcription factors (TFs)        that can potentially act as master regulators in AD. All expression profiles were        obtained from the Gene Expression Omnibus database using the GEOquery package. A        normal hippocampus transcription factor-centered regulatory network was        reconstructed using the ARACNe algorithm. Master regulator analysis and two-tail        gene set enrichment analysis were employed to evaluate the inferred regulatory        units in AD case-control studies. Finally, we used a connectivity map adaptation        to prospect new potential therapeutic interventions by drug repurposing. RESULTS:        We identified TFs with already reported involvement in AD, such as ATF2 and        PARK2, as well as possible new targets for future investigations, such as CNOT7,        CSRNP2, SLC30A9, and TSC22D1. Furthermore, Connectivity Map Analysis adaptation        suggested the repositioning of six FDA-approved drugs that can potentially        modulate master regulator candidate regulatory units (Cefuroxime, Cyproterone,        Dydrogesterone, Metrizamide, Trimethadione, and Vorinostat). CONCLUSIONS: Using a        transcription factor-centered regulatory network reconstruction we were able to        identify several potential molecular targets and six drug candidates for        repositioning in AD.

Understanding how this        variant confers AD risk promises to provide important insights into how myeloid        cells contribute to AD pathogenesis and progression. METHODS: In order to        investigate this mechanism, CRISPR/Cas9 was used to generate a mouse model of AD        harboring one copy of the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) encoding the R47H        variant in murine Trem2. TREM2 expression, myeloid cell responses to amyloid        deposition, plaque burden, and neuritic dystrophy were assessed at 4 months of        age. RESULTS: AD mice heterozygous for the Trem2 R47H allele exhibited reduced        total Trem2 mRNA expression, reduced TREM2 expression around plaques, and reduced        association of myeloid cells with plaques. These results were comparable to AD        mice lacking one copy of Trem2. AD mice heterozygous for the Trem2 R47H allele        also showed reduced myeloid cell responses to amyloid deposition, including a        reduction in proliferation and a reduction in CD45 expression around plaques.        Expression of the Trem2 R47H variant also reduced dense core plaque number but        increased plaque-associated neuritic dystrophy.

Sequential and structural analyses were performed        on Cas scaffolding protein family member 4 and protein tyrosine kinase 2 to        identify their core active binding sites. Molecular docking servers were used to        predict the common interacting residues in both Cas scaffolding protein family        member 4 and protein tyrosine kinase 2 and their involvement in Alzheimer's        disease-mediated pathways. Furthermore, the results from molecular dynamic        simulation experiment show the stability of targeted proteins. In addition, the        generated root mean square deviations and fluctuations, solvent-accessible        surface area, and gyration graphs also depict their backbone stability and        compactness, respectively. A better understanding of CAS and their interconnected        protein signaling cascade may help provide a treatment for Alzheimer's disease.        Further, Cas scaffolding protein family member 4 could be used as a novel target        for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease by inhibiting the protein tyrosine        kinase 2 pathway.",062d9e8017f45474b3bcce3ae1e119250969c4ba,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/062d9e8017f45474b3bcce3ae1e119250969c4ba,29789968,,,False,Neurological sciences : official journal of the Italian Neurological Society and,100959175
10.3389/fmed.2018.00108,The Role of Genetics in Advancing Precision Medicine for Alzheimer’s Disease—A Narrative Review,2018.0,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common type of dementia, which has a        substantial genetic component. AD affects predominantly older people.        Accordingly, the prevalence of dementia has been rising as the population ages.        To date, there are no effective interventions that can cure or halt the        progression of AD. The only available treatments are the management of certain        symptoms and consequences of dementia. The current state-of-the-art medical care        for AD comprises three simple principles: prevent the preventable, achieve early        diagnosis, and manage the manageable symptoms. This review provides a summary of        the current state of knowledge of risk factors for AD, biological diagnostic        testing, and prospects for treatment. Special emphasis is given to recent        advances in genetics of AD and the way genomic data may support prevention, early        intervention, and development of effective pharmacological treatments. Mutations        in the APP, PSEN1, and PSEN2 genes cause early onset Alzheimer's disease (EOAD)        that follows a Mendelian inheritance pattern. For late onset Alzheimer's disease        (LOAD), APOE4 was identified as a major risk allele more than two decades ago.        Population-based genome-wide association studies of late onset AD have now        additionally identified common variants at roughly 30 genetic loci. Furthermore,        rare variants (allele frequency <1%) that influence the risk for LOAD have been        identified in several genes. These genetic advances have broadened our insights        into the biological underpinnings of AD. Moreover, the known genetic risk        variants could be used to identify presymptomatic individuals at risk for AD and        support diagnostic assessment of symptomatic subjects. Genetic knowledge may also        facilitate precision medicine. The goal of precision medicine is to use        biological knowledge and other health information to predict individual disease        risk, understand disease etiology, identify disease subcategories, improve        diagnosis, and provide personalized treatment strategies. We discuss the        potential role of genetics in advancing precision medicine for AD along with its        ethical challenges. We outline strategies to implement genomics into        translational clinical research that will not only improve accuracy of dementia        diagnosis, thus enabling more personalized treatment strategies, but may also        speed up the discovery of novel drugs and interventions.",dc79c691d638bd8e5a6b03b8151ee2fedb071236,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/dc79c691d638bd8e5a6b03b8151ee2fedb071236,29740579,PMC5928202,,False,Frontiers in medicine,101648047

Here, we report a pathogenetic nexus        between absence of SMPD3 in the Golgi compartment (GC) of neurons of the smpd3-/-        mouse brain, inhibition of Golgi vesicular protein transport and progressive        cognitive impairment. Absence of SMPD3 activity in the Golgi sphingomyelin cycle        impedes remodeling of the lipid bilayer, essential for budding and multivesicular        body formation. Importantly, we show that inhibition of the Golgi vesicular        protein transport causes accumulation of neurotoxic proteins APP, Aβ and        phosphorylated Tau, dysproteostasis, unfolded protein response, and apoptosis,        which ultimately manifests in progressive cognitive decline, similar to the        pathognomonic signatures of familial and sporadic forms of Alzheimer´s disease.        This discovery might contribute to the search for other primary pathogenic        mechanisms, which link perturbed lipid bilayer structures and protein processing        and transport in the neuronal Golgi compartment and neurodegeneration and        cognitive deficits.",4a07db090c695b9c8158687ebe4419792351ba96,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/4a07db090c695b9c8158687ebe4419792351ba96,29725009,PMC5938706,,False,Cell death & disease,101524092

We observed the        reciprocal regulation of AD-associated genes (AD genes) and their related        functions. Upregulated AD genes were positioned in central regions in the        protein-protein interaction network and were involved in inflammation and DNA        repair pathways. Downregulated AD genes positioned in the periphery of the        network were associated with metabolic pathways. Using these features of AD        genes, we found that 5×FAD, amyloid β-injected mice, and rats in the initial        phases after bilateral common carotid artery occlusion (BCCAO) exhibited patterns        that were most similar to those of AD.

In humans, there        remains a need to better understand this HDAC9 polymorphism's contribution to        large vessel stroke. In this pilot study, we evaluated whether the HDAC9        polymorphism rs2107595 is associated with differences in leukocyte gene        expression in patients with LVAS. HDAC9 SNP rs2107595 was genotyped in 155        patients (43 LVAS and 112 vascular risk factor controls). RNA isolated from blood        was processed on whole genome microarrays. Gene expression was compared between        HDAC9 risk allele-positive and risk allele-negative LVAS patients and controls.        Functional analysis identified canonical pathways and molecular functions        associated with rs2107595 in LVAS. In HDAC9 SNP rs2107595 risk allele-positive        LVAS patients, there were 155 genes differentially expressed compared to risk        allele-negative patients (fold change > |1.2|, p < 0.05). The 155 genes separated        the risk allele-positive and risk allele-negative LVAS patients on a principal        component analysis. Pathways associated with HDAC9 risk allele-positive status        involved IL-6 signaling, cholesterol efflux, and platelet aggregation.

10.1016/j.ymthe.2018.02.029,"Targeting Amyloid-β Precursor Protein, APP, Splicing with Antisense Oligonucleotides Reduces Toxic Amyloid-β Production.",2018.0,"Alterations in amyloid beta precursor protein (APP) have been implicated in        cognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease (AD), which is accelerated in Down        syndrome/Trisomy 21 (DS/TS21), likely due to the extra copy of the APP gene,        located on chromosome 21. Proteolytic cleavage of APP generates amyloid-β (Aβ)        peptide, the primary component of senile plaques associated with AD. Reducing Aβ        production is predicted to lower plaque burden and mitigate AD symptoms. Here, we        designed a splice-switching antisense oligonucleotide (SSO) that causes skipping        of the APP exon that encodes proteolytic cleavage sites required for Aβ peptide        production. The SSO induced exon skipping in Down syndrome cell lines, resulting        in a reduction of Aβ. Treatment of mice with the SSO resulted in widespread        distribution in the brain accompanied by APP exon skipping and a reduction of Aβ.        Overall, we show that an alternatively spliced isoform of APP encodes a        cleavage-incompetent protein that does not produce Aβ peptide and that promoting        the production of this isoform with an SSO can reduce Aβ in vivo. These findings        demonstrate the utility of using SSOs to induce a spliced isoform of APP to        reduce Aβ as a potential approach for treating AD.",6bc098b7fd1ef97f208bb0d7db7e44ed96ae9d5a,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/6bc098b7fd1ef97f208bb0d7db7e44ed96ae9d5a,29628304,PMC5986716,,False,Molecular therapy : the journal of the American Society of Gene Therapy,100890581
10.3389/fnmol.2018.00087,On the Role of Store-Operated Calcium Entry in Acute and Chronic Neurodegenerative Diseases,2018.0,"In both excitable and non-excitable cells, calcium (Ca(2+)) signals are        maintained by a highly integrated process involving store-operated Ca(2+) entry        (SOCE), namely the opening of plasma membrane (PM) Ca(2+) channels following the        release of Ca(2+) from intracellular stores. Upon depletion of Ca(2+) store, the        stromal interaction molecule (STIM) senses Ca(2+) level reduction and migrates        from endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-like sites to the PM where it activates the        channel proteins Orai and/or the transient receptor potential channels (TRPC)        prompting Ca(2+) refilling. Accumulating evidence suggests that SOCE        dysregulation may trigger perturbation of intracellular Ca(2+) signaling in        neurons, glia or hematopoietic cells, thus participating to the pathogenesis of        diverse neurodegenerative diseases. Under acute conditions, such as ischemic        stroke, neuronal SOCE can either re-establish Ca(2+) homeostasis or mediate        Ca(2+) overload, thus providing a non-excitotoxic mechanism of ischemic neuronal        death. The dualistic role of SOCE in brain ischemia is further underscored by the        evidence that it also participates to endothelial restoration and to the        stabilization of intravascular thrombi. In Parkinson's disease (PD) models, loss        of SOCE triggers ER stress and dysfunction/degeneration of dopaminergic neurons.        Disruption of neuronal SOCE also underlies Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis,        since both in genetic mouse models and in human sporadic AD brain samples,        reduced SOCE contributes to synaptic loss and cognitive decline. Unlike the AD        setting, in the striatum from Huntington's disease (HD) transgenic mice, an        increased STIM2 expression causes elevated synaptic SOCE that was suggested to        underlie synaptic loss in medium spiny neurons. Thus, pharmacological inhibition        of SOCE is beneficial to synapse maintenance in HD models, whereas the same        approach may be anticipated to be detrimental to cortical and hippocampal        pyramidal neurons. On the other hand, up-regulation of SOCE may be beneficial        during AD. These intriguing findings highlight the importance of further        mechanistic studies to dissect the molecular pathways, and their corresponding        targets, involved in synaptic dysfunction and neuronal loss during aging and        neurodegenerative diseases.",ae438de1a4f54cdeceb249b1e57e1f3ceedbb538,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/ae438de1a4f54cdeceb249b1e57e1f3ceedbb538,29623030,PMC5874322,background,False,Frontiers in molecular neuroscience,101477914

METHODS: We analyzed data        from 702 participants (221 clinically normal, 367 with mild cognitive impairment,        and 114 with AD dementia) with genetic data and florbetapir PET available. A        subset of 669 participants additionally had longitudinal MRI scans to assess        hippocampal volume. Polygenic risk scores (PRSs) were estimated with summary        statistics from previous large-scale genome-wide association studies of AD        dementia. We examined relationships between APOE ε4 status and PRS with        longitudinal Aβ and cognitive and hippocampal volume measurements. RESULTS: APOE        ε4 was strongly related to baseline Aβ, whereas only weak associations between        PRS and baseline Aβ were present. APOE ε4 was additionally related to greater        memory decline and hippocampal atrophy in Aβ+ participants. When APOE ε4 was        controlled for, PRS was related to cognitive decline in Aβ+ participants.        Finally, PRSs were associated with hippocampal atrophy in Aβ- participants and        weakly associated with baseline hippocampal volume in Aβ+ participants.        CONCLUSIONS: Genetic risk factors of AD dementia demonstrate effects related to        Aβ, as well as synergistic interactions with Aβ. The specific effect of faster        cognitive decline in Aβ+ individuals with higher genetic risk may explain the        large degree of heterogeneity in cognitive trajectories among Aβ+ individuals.        Consideration of genetic variants in conjunction with baseline Aβ may improve        enrichment strategies for clinical trials targeting Aβ+ individuals most at risk        for imminent cognitive decline.",6db2a4ec63227b9b5e5727e2708bca3bdf9ced72,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/6db2a4ec63227b9b5e5727e2708bca3bdf9ced72,29592889,PMC5931806,,False,Neurology,0401060

This is based in part upon recent studies showing that: Gram-negative E.        coli bacteria can form extracellular amyloid; bacterial-encoded 16S rRNA is        present in all human brains with over 70% being Gram-negative bacteria;        ultrastructural analyses have shown microbes in erythrocytes of AD patients;        blood LPS levels in AD patients are 3-fold the levels in control; LPS combined        with focal cerebral ischemia and hypoxia produced amyloid-like plaques and myelin        injury in adult rat cortex. Moreover, Gram-negative bacterial LPS was found in        aging control and AD brains, though LPS levels were much higher in AD brains. In        addition, LPS co-localized with amyloid plaques, peri-vascular amyloid, neurons,        and oligodendrocytes in AD brains. Based upon the postulate LPS caused        oligodendrocyte injury, degraded Myelin Basic Protein (dMBP) levels were found to        be much higher in AD compared to control brains. Immunofluorescence showed that        the dMBP co-localized with β amyloid (Aβ) and LPS in amyloid plaques in AD brain,        and dMBP and other myelin molecules were found in the walls of vesicles in        periventricular White Matter (WM). These data led to the hypothesis that LPS acts        on leukocyte and microglial TLR4-CD14/TLR2 receptors to produce NFkB mediated        increases of cytokines which increase Aβ levels, damage oligodendrocytes and        produce myelin injury found in AD brain. Since Aβ(1-42) is also an agonist for        TLR4 receptors, this could produce a vicious cycle that accounts for the        relentless progression of AD. Thus, LPS, the TLR4 receptor complex, and        Gram-negative bacteria might be treatment or prevention targets for sporadic AD.",0a0928b1cd84e371304e541f2e0885f5cb7d545a,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0a0928b1cd84e371304e541f2e0885f5cb7d545a,29520228,PMC5827158,background,False,Frontiers in aging neuroscience,101525824

10.1038/s41419-017-0215-0,A key role for MAM in mediating mitochondrial dysfunction in Alzheimer disease,2018.0,"In the last few years, increased emphasis has been devoted to understanding the        contribution of mitochondria-associated endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membranes        (MAM) to human pathology in general, and neurodegenerative diseases in        particular. A major reason for this is the central role that this subdomain of        the ER plays in metabolic regulation and in mitochondrial biology. As such,        aberrant MAM function may help explain the seemingly unrelated metabolic        abnormalities often seen in neurodegeneration. In the specific case of Alzheimer        disease (AD), besides perturbations in calcium and lipid homeostasis, there are        numerous documented alterations in mitochondrial behavior and function, including        reduced respiratory chain activity and oxidative phosphorylation, increased free        radical production, and altered organellar morphology, dynamics, and positioning        (especially perinuclear mitochondria). However, whether these alterations are        primary events causative of the disease, or are secondary downstream events that        are the result of some other, more fundamental problem, is still unclear. In        support of the former possibility, we recently reported that C99, the C-terminal        processing product of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) derived from its        cleavage by β-secretase, is present in MAM, that its level is increased in AD,        and that this increase reduces mitochondrial respiration, likely via a        C99-induced alteration in cellular sphingolipid homeostasis. Thus, the metabolic        disturbances seen in AD likely arise from increased ER-mitochondrial        communication that is driven by an increase in the levels of C99 at the MAM.",186e7cc8366fa086eb5b45e87595b4e2024865f5,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/186e7cc8366fa086eb5b45e87595b4e2024865f5,29491396,PMC5832428,,False,Cell death & disease,101524092

BIN1 is an adaptor protein        that can bind to several proteins including c-Myc, clathrin, adaptor protein-2        and dynamin. BIN1 is widely expressed in the brain and peripheral tissue as        ubiquitous and tissue-specific alternatively spliced isoforms that regulate        membrane dynamics and endocytosis in multiple cell types. The function of BIN1 in        the brain and the mechanism(s) by which AD-associated BIN1 alleles increase the        risk for the disease are not known. BIN1 has been shown to interact with Tau and        two studies reported a positive correlation between BIN1 expression and        neurofibrillary tangle pathology in AD. However, an inverse correlation between        BIN1 expression and Tau propagation has also been reported. Moreover, there have        been conflicting reports on whether BIN1 is present in tangles. A recent study        characterized predominant BIN1 expression in mature oligodendrocytes in the gray        matter and the white matter in rodent, and the human brain. Here, we have        examined BIN1 localization in the brains of patients with AD using        immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence techniques to analyze BIN1 cellular        expression in relation to cellular markers and pathological lesions in AD. We        report that BIN1 immunoreactivity in human AD is not associated with        neurofibrillary tangles or senile plaques.

Hundreds of mutations have been reported with the majority resulting        from alterations in β-amyloid precursor protein (APP), presenilin 1 (PSEN1), or        presenilin 2 (PSEN2) genes. The roles of these mutations in the pathogenesis of        AD have been classically confirmed or refuted through functional studies, where        the mutations are cloned, inserted into cell lines, and monitored for changes in        various properties including cell survival, amyloid production, or Aβ42/40 ratio.        However, these verification studies tend to be expensive, time consuming, and        inconsistent. Recently, the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic        repeats-CRISPR-associated protein 9 (CRISPR-Cas9) system was developed, which        improves sequence-specific gene editing in cell lines, organs, and animals.        CRISPR-Cas9 is a promising tool for the generation of models of human genetic        diseases and could facilitate the establishment of new animal AD models and the        observation of dynamic bioprocesses in AD.

10.3389/fnagi.2018.00004,Autophagy and Alzheimer’s Disease: From Molecular Mechanisms to Therapeutic Implications,2018.0,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of progressive dementia in the        elderly. It is characterized by a progressive and irreversible loss of cognitive        abilities and formation of senile plaques, composed mainly of amyloid β (Aβ), and        neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), composed of tau protein, in the hippocampus and        cortex of afflicted humans. In brains of AD patients the metabolism of Aβ is        dysregulated, which leads to the accumulation and aggregation of Aβ. Metabolism        of Aβ and tau proteins is crucially influenced by autophagy. Autophagy is a        lysosome-dependent, homeostatic process, in which organelles and proteins are        degraded and recycled into energy. Thus, dysfunction of autophagy is suggested to        lead to the accretion of noxious proteins in the AD brain. In the present review,        we describe the process of autophagy and its importance in AD. Additionally, we        discuss mechanisms and genes linking autophagy and AD, i.e., the mTOR pathway,        neuroinflammation, endocannabinoid system, ATG7, BCL2, BECN1, CDK5, CLU, CTSD,        FOXO1, GFAP, ITPR1, MAPT, PSEN1, SNCA, UBQLN1, and UCHL1.

METHODS: We used over 200 ""AD resilient""        individuals and an innovative, pedigree-based approach to identify genetic        variants that segregate with AD resilience. First, we performed linkage analyses        in pedigrees with resilient individuals and a statistical excess of AD deaths.        Second, we used whole genome sequences to identify candidate SNPs in significant        linkage regions. Third, we replicated SNPs from the linkage peaks that reduced        risk for AD in an independent dataset and in a gene-based test. Finally, we        experimentally characterized replicated SNPs. RESULTS: Rs142787485 in RAB10        confers significant protection against AD (p value = 0.0184, odds        ratio = 0.5853). Moreover, we replicated this association in an independent        series of unrelated individuals (p value = 0.028, odds ratio = 0.69) and used a        gene-based test to confirm a role for RAB10 variants in modifying AD risk (p        value = 0.002).

Many        signaling pathways contribute to the precise regulation of apoptosis. Here we        show that Jun N-terminal Kinase (JNK) activity contributes to the coordinated        removal of interommatidial cells via apoptosis in the Drosophila pupal retina.        This is consistent with previous findings that JNK activity promotes apoptosis in        other epithelia. However, we found that JNK activity is repressed by Cindr (the        CIN85 and CD2AP ortholog) in order to promote cell survival. Reducing the amount        of Cindr resulted in ectopic cell death. Increased expression of the Drosophila        JNK basket in the setting of reduced cindr expression was found to result in even        more severe apoptosis, whilst ectopic death was found to be reduced if retinas        were heterozygous for basket. Hence Cindr is required to properly restrict        JNK-mediated apoptosis in the pupal eye, resulting in the correct number of        interommatidial cells.

Several lines of evidence        including neuroimaging and neuropathological data suggest that Alzheimer's        disease (AD) may be associated with dysmyelination and a breakdown of OL-axon        communication. METHODS: In order to understand this phenomenon on a molecular        level, we systematically interrogated OL-enriched gene networks constructed from        large-scale genomic, transcriptomic and proteomic data obtained from human AD        postmortem brain samples. We then validated these networks using gene expression        datasets generated from mice with ablation of major gene expression nodes        identified in our AD-dysregulated networks. RESULTS: The robust OL gene        coexpression networks that we identified were highly enriched for genes        associated with AD risk variants, such as BIN1 and demonstrated strong        dysregulation in AD. We further corroborated the structure of the corresponding        gene causal networks using datasets generated from the brain of mice with        ablation of key network drivers, such as UGT8, CNP and PLP1, which were        identified from human AD brain data. Further, we found that mice with genetic        ablations of Cnp mimicked aspects of myelin and mitochondrial gene expression        dysregulation seen in brain samples from patients with AD, including decreased        protein expression of BIN1 and GOT2. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides a molecular        blueprint of the dysregulation of gene expression networks of OL in AD and        identifies key OL- and myelination-related genes and networks that are highly        associated with AD.",42fcfd02910160bb3bbc423d686fb1cf8de069e1,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/42fcfd02910160bb3bbc423d686fb1cf8de069e1,29110684,PMC5674813,result,False,Molecular neurodegeneration,101266600

Here, we describe the        fine-mapping of these 2 linkage regions, and test for replication in 6        independent datasets. By fine-mapping these linkage signals in a single large        family, we reduced the linkage regions to 11% their original size and nominated        54 candidate variants.

AREAS COVERED: APOEe4 is the strongest        genetic risk factor for non-Mendelian LOAD, and the APOE-linkage disequilibrium        (LD) region has produced the most significant association signal in multi-center        genome-wide-association-studies (GWAS). Consideration of extended haplotypes in        the APOE-LD region and specifically, non-coding variants in putative enhancer        elements, such as the TOMM40-polyT, in-addition to the coding variants that        comprise the APOE-genotypes, may be useful for predicting subjects at high-risk        of developing LOAD and estimating age-of-onset of early disease-stage symptoms.

Here, we investigated the role of RIPK1 in microglia mediating the        pathogenesis of AD. RIPK1 is highly expressed by microglial cells in human AD        brains. Using the amyloid precursor protein (APP)/presenilin 1 (PS1) transgenic        mouse model, we found that inhibition of RIPK1, using both pharmacological and        genetic means, reduced amyloid burden, the levels of inflammatory cytokines, and        memory deficits. Furthermore, inhibition of RIPK1 promoted microglial degradation        of Aβ in vitro. We characterized the transcriptional profiles of adult microglia        from APP/PS1 mice and identified a role for RIPK1 in regulating the microglial        expression of CH25H and Cst7, a marker for disease-associated microglia (DAM),        which encodes an endosomal/lysosomal cathepsin inhibitor named Cystatin F.

They constantly survey the CNS environment and as immune cells, in        pathological contexts, they provide the first host defense and orchestrate the        immune response. It is well recognized that under pathological conditions        microglia have both sequential and simultaneous, beneficial and detrimental        effects. Cell-specific transcriptomics recently became popular in Neuroscience        field allowing concurrent monitoring of the expression of numerous genes in a        given cell population.

In particular, we compare advantages and drawbacks of flow        cytometry and laser microdissection to isolate pure microglia population as well        as identification of deregulated microglial genes obtained via RNA sequencing        (RNA-Seq) vs. microarrays approaches. Second, we summarize insights obtained from        microglia transcriptomes in traumatic brain and spinal cord injuries, pain and        more chronic neurological conditions including Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis        (ALS), Alzheimer disease (AD) and Multiple sclerosis (MS). Transcriptomic        responses of microglia in other non-neurodegenerative CNS disorders such as        gliomas and sepsis are also addressed. Third, we present a comparison of the most        activated pathways in each neuropathological condition using Gene ontology (GO)        classification and highlight the diversity of microglia response to insults        focusing on their pro- and anti-inflammatory signatures. Finally, we discuss the        potential of the latest technological advances, in particular, single cell        RNA-Seq to unravel the individual microglial response diversity in        neuropathological contexts.",06388c47775e930db106415843b0ab1ccd9dee4d,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/06388c47775e930db106415843b0ab1ccd9dee4d,28785215,PMC5519576,background,True,Frontiers in aging neuroscience,101525824

Early onset AD is caused by        mutations in three genes: Amyloid-β precursor protein, presenilin 1 (PSEN1) and        PSEN2. Late onset AD (LOAD) is complex and apolipoprotein E is the only        unanimously accepted genetic risk factor for its development. Various genes        implicated in AD have been identified using advanced genetic technologies,        however, there are many additional genes that remain unidentified. The present        review highlights the genetics of early and LOAD and summarizes the genes        involved in different signaling pathways.

10.1186/s13024-017-0197-5,TREM2 in Neurodegenerative Diseases,2017.0,"TREM2 variants have been identified as risk factors for Alzheimer's disease (AD)        and other neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs). Because TREM2 encodes a receptor        exclusively expressed on immune cells, identification of these variants        conclusively demonstrates that the immune response can play an active role in the        pathogenesis of NDDs. These TREM2 variants also confer the highest risk for        developing Alzheimer's disease of any risk factor identified in nearly two        decades, suggesting that understanding more about TREM2 function could provide        key insights into NDD pathology and provide avenues for novel immune-related NDD        biomarkers and therapeutics. The expression, signaling and function of TREM2 in        NDDs have been extensively investigated in an effort to understand the role of        immune function in disease pathogenesis and progression. We provide a        comprehensive review of our current understanding of TREM2 biology, including new        insights into the regulation of TREM2 expression, and TREM2 signaling and        function across NDDs. While many open questions remain, the current body of        literature provides clarity on several issues. While it is still often cited that        TREM2 expression is decreased by pro-inflammatory stimuli, it is now clear that        this is true in vitro, but inflammatory stimuli in vivo almost universally        increase TREM2 expression. Likewise, while TREM2 function is classically        described as promoting an anti-inflammatory phenotype, more than half of        published studies demonstrate a pro-inflammatory role for TREM2, suggesting that        its role in inflammation is much more complex. Finally, these components of TREM2        biology are applied to a discussion of how TREM2 impacts NDD pathologies and the        latest assessment of how these findings might be applied to immune-directed        clinical biomarkers and therapeutics.",ac51af9995edb441f0ce4fdc384908daa6e83675,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/ac51af9995edb441f0ce4fdc384908daa6e83675,28768545,PMC5541421,background,False,Molecular neurodegeneration,101266600
10.1001/jamaneurol.2017.1518,Early-Onset Alzheimer Disease and Candidate Risk Genes Involved in Endolysosomal Transport,2017.0,"IMPORTANCE: Mutations in APP, PSEN1, and PSEN2 lead to early-onset Alzheimer        disease (EOAD) but account for only approximately 11% of EOAD overall, leaving        most of the genetic risk for the most severe form of Alzheimer disease        unexplained. This extreme phenotype likely harbors highly penetrant risk        variants, making it primed for discovery of novel risk genes and pathways for AD.        OBJECTIVE: To search for rare variants contributing to the risk for EOAD. DESIGN,        SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: In this case-control study, whole-exome sequencing        (WES) was performed in 51 non-Hispanic white (NHW) patients with EOAD (age at        onset <65 years) and 19 Caribbean Hispanic families previously screened as        negative for established APP, PSEN1, and PSEN2 causal variants. Participants were        recruited from John P. Hussman Institute for Human Genomics, Case Western Reserve        University, and Columbia University. Rare, deleterious, nonsynonymous, or        loss-of-function variants were filtered to identify variants in known and        suspected AD genes, variants in multiple unrelated NHW patients, variants present        in 19 Hispanic EOAD WES families, and genes with variants in multiple unrelated        NHW patients. These variants/genes were tested for association in an independent        cohort of 1524 patients with EOAD, 7046 patients with late-onset AD (LOAD), and        7001 cognitively intact controls (age at examination, >65 years) from the        Alzheimer's Disease Genetics Consortium. The study was conducted from January 21,        2013, to October 13, 2016. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Alzheimer disease        diagnosed according to standard National Institute of Neurological and        Communicative Disorders and Stroke and the Alzheimer Disease and Related        Disorders Association criteria. Association between Alzheimer disease and genetic        variants and genes was measured using logistic regression and sequence kernel        association test-optimal gene tests, respectively. RESULTS: Of the 1524 NHW        patients with EOAD, 765 (50.2%) were women and mean (SD) age was 60.0 (4.9)        years; of the 7046 NHW patients with LOAD, 4171 (59.2%) were women and mean (SD)        age was 77.4 (8.6) years; and of the 7001 NHW controls, 4215 (60.2%) were women        and mean (SD) age was 77.4 (8.6) years. The gene PSD2, for which multiple        unrelated NHW cases had rare missense variants, was significantly associated with        EOAD (P = 2.05 × 10-6; Bonferroni-corrected P value [BP] = 1.3 × 10-3) and LOAD        (P = 6.22 × 10-6; BP = 4.1 × 10-3). A missense variant in TCIRG1, present in a        NHW patient and segregating in 3 cases of a Hispanic family, was more frequent in        EOAD cases (odds ratio [OR], 2.13; 95% CI, 0.99-4.55; P = .06; BP = 0.413), and        significantly associated with LOAD (OR, 2.23; 95% CI, 1.37-3.62; P = 7.2 × 10-4;        BP = 5.0 × 10-3). A missense variant in the LOAD risk gene RIN3 showed suggestive        evidence of association with EOAD after Bonferroni correction (OR, 4.56; 95% CI,        1.26-16.48; P = .02, BP = 0.091). In addition, a missense variant in RUFY1        identified in 2 NHW EOAD cases showed suggestive evidence of an association with        EOAD as well (OR, 18.63; 95% CI, 1.62-213.45; P = .003; BP = 0.129). CONCLUSIONS        AND RELEVANCE: The genes PSD2, TCIRG1, RIN3, and RUFY1 all may be involved in        endolysosomal transport-a process known to be important to development of AD.        Furthermore, this study identified shared risk genes between EOAD and LOAD        similar to previously reported genes, such as SORL1, PSEN2, and TREM2.",9b0fd3841a8e35e984e0c40e276e3b477ddc736a,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/9b0fd3841a8e35e984e0c40e276e3b477ddc736a,28738127,PMC5691589,,False,JAMA neurology,101589536

Our goal was to identify genes that influence        plasma aβ42 concentrations and aβ42:aβ40 ratios in late middle age (mean = 59        years), old age (mean = 77 years), or change over time (mean = 18 years).        METHODS: Plasma aβ measures were linearly regressed onto age, gender, APOE ε4        carrier status, and time elapsed between visits (fold-changes only) separately by        race. Following inverse normal transformation of the residuals, seqMeta was used        to conduct race-specific single-variant and gene-based association tests while        adjusting for population structure. Linear regression models were fit on        autosomal variants with minor allele frequencies (MAF)≥1%. T5 burden and Sequence        Kernel Association (SKAT) gene-based tests assessed functional variants with        MAF≤5%. Cross-race fixed effects meta-analyses were Bonferroni-corrected for the        number of variants or genes tested. RESULTS: Seven genes were associated with aβ        in late middle age or change over time; no associations were identified in old        age. Single variants in KLKB1 (rs3733402; p = 4.33x10-10) and F12 (rs1801020; p =        3.89x10-8) were significantly associated with midlife aβ42 levels through        cross-race meta-analysis; the KLKB1 variant replicated internally using 1,014        additional participants with exome chip. ITPRIP, PLIN2, and TSPAN18 were        associated with the midlife aβ42:aβ40 ratio via the T5 test; TSPAN18 was        significant via the cross-race meta-analysis, whereas ITPRIP and PLIN2 were        European American-specific. NCOA1 and NT5C3B were associated with the midlife        aβ42:aβ40 ratio and the fold-change in aβ42, respectively, via SKAT in African        Americans.

10.1096/fj.201700359,Amyloid precursor protein and endosomal‐lysosomal dysfunction in Alzheimer's disease: inseparable partners in a multifactorial disease,2017.0,"Abnormalities of the endosomal-lysosomal network (ELN) are a signature feature of        Alzheimer's disease (AD). These include the earliest known cytopathology that is        specific to AD and that affects endosomes and induces the progressive failure of        lysosomes, each of which are directly linked by distinct mechanisms to        neurodegeneration. The origins of ELN dysfunction and β-amyloidogenesis closely        overlap, which reflects their common genetic basis, the established early        involvement of endosomes and lysosomes in amyloid precursor protein (APP)        processing and clearance, and the pathologic effect of certain APP metabolites on        ELN functions. Genes that promote β-amyloidogenesis in AD (APP, PSEN1/2, and        APOE4) have primary effects on ELN function. The importance of primary ELN        dysfunction to pathogenesis is underscored by the mutations in more than 35        ELN-related genes that, thus far, are known to cause familial neurodegenerative        diseases even though different pathogenic proteins may be involved. In this        article, I discuss growing evidence that implicates AD gene-driven ELN        disruptions as not only the antecedent pathobiology that underlies        β-amyloidogenesis but also as the essential partner with APP and its metabolites        that drive the development of AD, including tauopathy, synaptic dysfunction, and        neurodegeneration. The striking amelioration of diverse deficits in animal AD        models by remediating ELN dysfunction further supports a need to integrate APP        and ELN relationships, including the role of amyloid-β, into a broader conceptual        framework of how AD arises, progresses, and may be effectively therapeutically        targeted.-Nixon, R.

In animal models of AD infection can also cause damage, with evidence of        increased neuroinflammation, amyloid pathology and deterioration of cognitive        function. These changes are against a backdrop of an age- and AD-related increase        in susceptibility to infection.

Higher plasma anthranilic acid levels were        associated with greater risk of dementia (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.40; 95%        confidence interval [CI] = [1.15-1.70]; P = 8.08 × 10(-4)). Glutamic acid        (HR = 1.38; 95% CI = [1.11-1.72]), taurine (HR = 0.74; 95% CI = [0.60-0.92]), and        hypoxanthine (HR = 0.74; 95% CI = [0.60-0.92]) levels also showed suggestive        associations with dementia risk. DISCUSSION: We identified four biologically        plausible, candidate plasma biomarkers for dementia. Association of anthranilic        acid implicates the kynurenine pathway, which modulates glutamate excitotoxicity.        The associations with hypoxanthine and taurine strengthen evidence that uric acid        and taurine may be neuroprotective.",ac50613d4324849f46f3082dd2acf74e7fcb3e0a,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/ac50613d4324849f46f3082dd2acf74e7fcb3e0a,28602601,PMC5722716,background,False,Alzheimer's & dementia : the journal of the Alzheimer's Association,101231978
10.1007/s00115-017-0354-7,Suche nach Risikogenen bei der Alzheimer-Erkrankung,2017.0,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of neurodegenerative dementia.        The susceptibility to AD is determined by a complex interaction between genetic,        epigenetic, and environmental factors. Herein, the risk that can be attributed to        genetic factors is high (up to 80%). While most AD patients are sporadic, in rare        families Mendelian mode of inheritance can be observed. In these rare familial        cases, full penetrant mutations have been identified in APP, PSEN1, and PSEN2.        Mutations in these three genes are however rarely found in sporadic AD. For over        20 years, the only known genetic risk factor in sporadic AD cases was the APOE-ε4        allele, which increases susceptibility to AD by approximately threefold.        Unfortunately, none of these genes explain the frequency of AD. Identification of        additional genetic factors was propelled by the advent of genomic approaches such        as genome-wide association studies, which has already led to the characterization        of 26 novel genetic risk factors. Interestingly, several of these genetic signals        cluster in biological pathways including cholesterol, lipid metabolism, immune        response, and endocytic trafficking. An additional impulse in genetic research        came from the development of novel sequencing technologies. For example, the        whole exome sequencing approach has identified an association between the risk of        AD and rare coding variants (minor allele frequency <1%) located in genes such as        TREM2, SORL1, and ABCA7. Thus, progress from genetic research has significantly        increased our understanding of the disease mechanisms operating in AD. However,        even though our knowledge of the genetics of sporadic forms of AD has progressed        markedly over the last years, it is still far from complete.

10.2174/1570159X15666170529104323,"The Role of Sigma-1 Receptor, an Intracellular Chaperone in Neurodegenerative Diseases",2017.0,"BACKGROUND: Widespread protein aggregation occurs in the living system under        stress or during aging, owing to disturbance of endoplasmic reticulum (ER)        proteostasis. Many neurodegenerative diseases may have a common mechanism: the        failure of protein homeostasis. Perturbation of ER results in unfolded protein        response (UPR). Prolonged chronical UPR may activate apoptotic pathways and cause        cell death. METHODS: Research articles on Sigma-1 receptor were reviewed.        RESULTS: ER is associated to mitochondria by the mitochondria-associated        ER-membrane, MAM. The sigma-1 receptor (Sig-1R), a well-known ER-chaperone        localizes in the MAM. It serves for Ca2+-signaling between the ER and        mitochondria, involved in ion channel activities and especially important during        neuronal differentiation. Sig-1R acts as central modulator in inter-organelle        signaling. Sig-1R helps cell survival by attenuating ER-stress. According to        sequence based predictions Sig-1R is a 223 amino acid protein with two        transmembrane (2TM) domains. The X-ray structure of the Sig-1R [1] showed a        membrane-bound trimeric assembly with one transmembrane (1TM) region. Despite the        in vitro determined assembly, the results of in vivo studies are rather        consistent with the 2TM structure. The receptor has unique and versatile        pharmacological profile. Dimethyl tryptamine (DMT) and neuroactive steroids are        endogenous ligands that activate Sig-1R. The receptor has a plethora of        interacting client proteins. Sig-1R exists in oligomeric structures        (dimer-trimer-octamer-multimer) and this fact may explain interaction with        diverse proteins. CONCLUSION: Sig-1R agonists have been used in the treatment of        different neurodegenerative diseases, e.g. Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases        (AD and PD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Utilization of Sig-1R agents early        in AD and similar other diseases has remained an overlooked therapeutic        opportunity.",10fbcae85923128fe315977e4d65f98750864880,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/10fbcae85923128fe315977e4d65f98750864880,28554311,PMC5771390,background,False,Current neuropharmacology,101157239

The majority of drugs developed for AD focus        on the amyloid cascade hypothesis, which implicates Aß plaques as a causal factor        in the disease. However, it is possible that other underexplored        disease-associated pathways may be more fruitful targets for drug development.        Findings from gene network analyses implicate immune networks as being enriched        in AD; many of the genes in these networks fall within genomic regions that        contain common and rare variants that are associated with increased risk of        developing AD. Of these genes, several (including CR1, SPI1, the MS4As, TREM2,        ABCA7, CD33, and INPP5D) are expressed by microglia, the resident immune cells of        the brain. We summarize the gene network and genetics findings that implicate        that these microglial genes are involved in AD, as well as several studies that        have looked at the expression and function of these genes in microglia and in the        context of AD.

10.1371/journal.pmed.1002272,Fine-mapping of the human leukocyte antigen locus as a risk factor for Alzheimer disease: A case–control study,2017.0,"BACKGROUND: Alzheimer disease (AD) is a progressive disorder that affects        cognitive function. There is increasing support for the role of neuroinflammation        and aberrant immune regulation in the pathophysiology of AD. The immunoregulatory        human leukocyte antigen (HLA) complex has been linked to susceptibility for a        number of neurodegenerative diseases, including AD; however, studies to date have        failed to consistently identify a risk HLA haplotype for AD. Contributing to this        difficulty are the complex genetic organization of the HLA region, differences in        sequencing and allelic imputation methods, and diversity across ethnic        populations. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Building on prior work linking the HLA to AD,        we used a robust imputation method on two separate case-control cohorts to        examine the relationship between HLA haplotypes and AD risk in 309 individuals        (191 AD, 118 cognitively normal [CN] controls) from the San Francisco-based        University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) Memory and Aging Center (collected        between 1999-2015) and 11,381 individuals (5,728 AD, 5,653 CN controls) from the        Alzheimer's Disease Genetics Consortium (ADGC), a National Institute on Aging        (NIA)-funded national data repository (reflecting samples collected between        1984-2012). We also examined cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarker measures for        patients seen between 2005-2007 and longitudinal cognitive data from the        Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (n = 346, mean follow-up 3.15 ± 2.04        y in AD individuals) to assess the clinical relevance of identified risk        haplotypes. The strongest association with AD risk occurred with major        histocompatibility complex (MHC) haplotype        A*03:01~B*07:02~DRB1*15:01~DQA1*01:02~DQB1*06:02 (p = 9.6 x 10-4, odds ratio [OR]        [95% confidence interval] = 1.21 [1.08-1.37]) in the combined UCSF + ADGC cohort.        Secondary analysis suggested that this effect may be driven primarily by        individuals who are negative for the established AD genetic risk factor,        apolipoprotein E (APOE) ɛ4. Separate analyses of class I and II haplotypes        further supported the role of class I haplotype A*03:01~B*07:02 (p = 0.03, OR =        1.11 [1.01-1.23]) and class II haplotype DRB1*15:01- DQA1*01:02- DQB1*06:02        (DR15) (p = 0.03, OR = 1.08 [1.01-1.15]) as risk factors for AD. We followed up        these findings in the clinical dataset representing the spectrum of cognitively        normal controls, individuals with mild cognitive impairment, and individuals with        AD to assess their relevance to disease. Carrying A*03:01~B*07:02 was associated        with higher CSF amyloid levels (p = 0.03, β ± standard error = 47.19 ± 21.78). We        also found a dose-dependent association between the DR15 haplotype and greater        rates of cognitive decline (greater impairment on the 11-item Alzheimer's Disease        Assessment Scale cognitive subscale [ADAS11] over time [p = 0.03, β ± standard        error = 0.7 ± 0.3]; worse forgetting score on the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning        Test (RAVLT) over time [p = 0.02, β ± standard error = -0.2 ± 0.06]). In a subset        of the same cohort, dose of DR15 was also associated with higher baseline levels        of chemokine CC-4, a biomarker of inflammation (p = 0.005, β ± standard error =        0.08 ± 0.03). The main study limitations are that the results represent only        individuals of European-ancestry and clinically diagnosed individuals, and that        our study used imputed genotypes for a subset of HLA genes. CONCLUSIONS: We        provide evidence that variation in the HLA locus-including risk haplotype        DR15-contributes to AD risk. DR15 has also been associated with multiple        sclerosis, and its component alleles have been implicated in Parkinson disease        and narcolepsy.

CX3CR1 is a        microglia-specific gene involved in microglia-neuron crosstalk and        neuroinflammation. Numerous evidence show the involvement of CX3CR1 in AD. The        aim of this study was to investigate if some functional genetic variants of this        gene could influence on LOAD's outcome, in a neuropathologically confirmed        Spanish cohort. We designed an open, pragmatic, case-control retrospective study        including a total of 475 subjects (205 pathologically confirmed AD cases and 270        controls). We analyzed the association of the two CX3CR1 functional variants        (V249I, rs3732379; and T280M, rs3732378) with neurofibrillary pathology        progression rate according to Braak's staging system, age at onset (AAO),        survival time, and risk of suffering LOAD. We found that individuals heterozygous        for CX3CR1-V249I presented a lower neurofibrillary pathology stage at death        (OR = 0.42, 95%CI [0.23, 0.74], p = 0.003, adj-p = 0.013) than the other        genotypes. Eighty percent of the subjects homozygous for 249I had higher        neurofibrillary pathology progression (Braak's stage VI). Moreover, homozygosis        for 280M and 249I could be associated with a higher AAO in the subgroups of AD        with Lewy bodies and without Lewy bodies. These CX3CR1 genetic variants could        represent new modifying factors of pathology progression and age at onset in        LOAD. These results provide further evidence of the involvement of CX3CR1 pathway        and microglia/macrophages in the pathogenesis of LOAD.",4eb533e2f9c46a64ea904a54014e9e5d20829c31,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/4eb533e2f9c46a64ea904a54014e9e5d20829c31,28343297,,background,False,Molecular neurobiology,8900963

METHODS: Ninety-five individuals        from the Wisconsin Registry for Alzheimer's Prevention were included in these        cross-sectional analyses. They were genotyped for APOE4, CLU, and ABCA7, from        which a PRS was calculated for each participant. The participants underwent        lumbar puncture for CSF collection. β-Amyloid 42 (Aβ(42)), Aβ(40), total tau        (t-tau), and phosphorylated tau (p-tau) were quantified by immunoassays, and        Aβ(42)/Aβ(40) and tau/Aβ(42) ratios were computed. CRF was estimated from a        validated equation incorporating sex, age, body mass index, resting heart rate,        and self-reported physical activity. Covariate-adjusted regression analyses were        used to test for associations between the PRS and CSF biomarkers. In addition, by        including a PRS×CRF term in the models, we examined whether these associations        were modified by CRF. RESULTS: A higher PRS was associated with lower        Aβ(42)/Aβ(40) (p < 0.001), higher t-tau/Aβ(42) (p = 0.012), and higher        p-tau/Aβ(42) (p = 0.040). Furthermore, we observed PRS × CRF interactions for        Aβ(42)/Aβ(40) (p = 0.003), t-tau/Aβ(42) (p = 0.003), and p-tau/Aβ(42) (p =        0.001). Specifically, the association between the PRS and these CSF biomarkers        was diminished in those with higher CRF. CONCLUSIONS: In a late-middle-aged        cohort, CRF attenuates the adverse influence of genetic vulnerability on CSF        biomarkers.

The disease is among the leading medical concerns of the        modern world, because only symptomatic therapies are available, and no reliable,        easily accessible biomarkers exist for AD detection and monitoring. Therefore        extensive research is conducted to elucidate the mechanisms of AD pathogenesis,        which seems to be heterogeneous and multifactorial.

DISCUSSION: In this review, we discuss what is        currently known about the genetics of vascular dementia. The identification of        causal genes remains limited to monogenic forms of the disease, with findings for        sporadic vascular dementia being less robust. However, progress in genetic        research on associated phenotypes, such as cerebral small vessel disease,        Alzheimer's disease, and stroke, have the potential to inform on the genetics of        vascular dementia.

Employing successful intervention and treatment strategies focused        on disease prevention is currently the only available approach that can have an        impact on the projected rates of dementia, with risk assessment being a key        component of population-based risk reduction for identification of at-risk        individuals. We evaluated a risk index comprising lifestyle, medical and        demographic factors (the Australian National University Alzheimer's Disease Risk        Index [ANU-ADRI]), as well as a genetic risk score (GRS), for assessment of the        risk of progression to mild cognitive impairment (MCI).

GRSs were constructed on the basis of        25 single-nucleotide polymorphisms previously associated with Alzheimer's disease        (AD). Participants were assessed for clinically diagnosed MCI and dementia as        well as psychometric test-based MCI (MCI-TB) at 12 years of follow-up.        Multi-state models were used to estimate the odds of transitioning from        cognitively normal (CN) to MCI, dementia and MCI-TB over 12 years according to        baseline ANU-ADRI and GRS. RESULTS: A higher ANU-ADRI score was associated with        increased risk of progressing from CN to both MCI and MCI-TB (HR 1.07 [95% CI        1.04-1.11]; 1.07 [1.04-1.09]). The GRS was associated with transitions from CN to        dementia (HR 4.19 [95% CI 1.72-10.20), but not to MCI or MCI-TB (HR 1.05 [95% CI        0.86-1.29]; 1.03 [0.87-1.21]). Limitations of our study include that the        ethnicity of participants in the PATH project is predominately Caucasian,        potentially limiting the generalisability of the results of this study to people        of other ethnicities. Biomarkers of AD were not available to define MCI        attributable to AD. Not all the predictive variables for the ANU-ADRI were        available in the PATH project. CONCLUSIONS: In the general population, the        ANU-ADRI, comprising lifestyle, medical and demographic factors, is associated        with the risk of progression from CN to MCI, whereas a GRS comprising the main AD        risk genes was not associated with this risk.

In APP transgenic        mice, lack of Abca1 increased Aβ deposition and cognitive deficits. Abca1        haplo-deficiency in mice expressing human APOE isoforms, increased level of Aβ        oligomers and worsened memory deficits, preferentially in APOE4 mice. In contrast        upregulation of Abca1 by LXR/RXR agonists significantly ameliorated pathological        phenotype of those mice. The goal of this study was to examine the effect of LXR        agonist T0901317 (T0) on the phenotype and brain transcriptome of APP/E3 and        APP/E4 Abca1 haplo-deficient (APP/E3/Abca1+/- and APP/E4/Abca1+/-) mice. Our data        demonstrate that activated LXRs/RXR ameliorated APOE4-driven pathological        phenotype and significantly affected brain transcriptome. We show that in mice        expressing either APOE isoform, T0 treatment increased mRNA level of genes known        to affect brain APOE lipidation such as Abca1 and Abcg1. In both APP/E3/Abca1+/-        and APP/E4/Abca1+/- mice, the application of LXR agonist significantly increased        ABCA1 protein level accompanied by an increased APOE lipidation, and was        associated with restoration of APOE4 cognitive deficits, reduced levels of Aβ        oligomers, but unchanged amyloid load. Finally, using Gene set enrichment        analysis we show a significant APOE isoform specific response to LXR agonist        treatment: Gene Ontology categories ""Microtubule Based Process"" and ""Synapse        Organization"" were differentially affected in T0-treated APP/E4/Abca1+/- mice.        Altogether, the results are suggesting that treatment of APP/E4/Abca1+/- mice        with LXR agonist T0 ameliorates APOE4-induced AD-like pathology and therefore        targeting the LXR-ABCA1-APOE regulatory axis could be effective as a potential        therapeutic approach in AD patients, carriers of APOEε4.",ba934e8f5cf3cbc77c89bb0059d6550c3c69c96a,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/ba934e8f5cf3cbc77c89bb0059d6550c3c69c96a,28241068,PMC5328633,,False,PloS one,101285081

In this study, we assessed whether single        nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within these 27 AD-associatedgenes are linked        with cognitive aging independently and/or through complex interactions in an        older Taiwanese population. We also analyzed the interactions between lifestyle        and these genes in influencing cognitive aging. A total of 634 Taiwanese subjects        aged over 60 years from the Taiwan Biobank were analyzed. Mini-Mental State        Examination (MMSE) scores were performed for all subjects to evaluate cognitive        functions.

This in turn may trigger        neuroinflammation, progressive synaptic loss, and ultimately cognitive decline.        Clearance of cerebral Aβ is a complex process mediated by various systems and        cell types, including vascular transport across the blood-brain barrier,        glymphatic drainage, and engulfment and degradation by resident microglia and        infiltrating innate immune cells. Recent studies have highlighted a new,        unexpected role for peripheral monocytes and macrophages in restricting cerebral        Aβ fibrils, and possibly soluble oligomers. In AD transgenic (ADtg) mice,        monocyte ablation or inhibition of their migration into the brain exacerbated Aβ        pathology, while blood enrichment with monocytes and their increased recruitment        to plaque lesion sites greatly diminished Aβ burden. Profound neuroprotective        effects in ADtg mice were further achieved through increased cerebral recruitment        of myelomonocytes overexpressing Aβ-degrading enzymes.

10.1007/s12035-017-0397-6,The Arc Gene Confers Genetic Susceptibility to Alzheimer’s Disease in Han Chinese,2018.0,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia. The deposition of        β-amyloid (Aβ) plaques in the brain was considered one of the main        neuropathological hallmarks of AD. As the loss of synapses always occurs during        AD progression, AD has been gradually regarded as a ""synaptopathy."" The        activity-regulated cytoskeleton-associated protein (Arc) was recently identified        as a key factor for AD due to its active roles in synaptic plasticity, learning,        memory, and Aβ generation. However, there is little evidence to support the        association of the Arc gene with AD. In this study, a two-stage case-control        study of 1471 Han Chinese was conducted to investigate the genetic association        between the Arc gene and AD. Variant rs10097505 in the 3'UTR region was        significantly associated with AD. The whole exons of the Arc gene were also        screened in 99 AD patients with a high heritability (familial and/or onset age        <55 years old). One missense variant (c.20G>A, p.T7I) was identified in two AD        patients but was absent in the controls from the general populations. Both        rs10097505 and c.20G>A were predicted to be potentially pathogenic. Further        luciferase assay, data mining, and integrative analyses revealed that the AD-risk        genotype AA of rs10097505 was associated with an increased Arc mRNA expression        and an elevated Aβ level. Our results indicated that the Arc gene would confer        susceptibility to AD in Han Chinese, probably through changing the protein        structure or affecting the Arc expression in brain tissues, which would finally        contribute to the pathogenesis and development of AD.",2314b85b3fef087437314b7deef16dc5c0af5e32,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/2314b85b3fef087437314b7deef16dc5c0af5e32,28108859,,background,False,Molecular neurobiology,8900963
10.1523/JNEUROSCI.2110-16.2016,Disease Progression-Dependent Effects of TREM2 Deficiency in a Mouse Model of Alzheimer's Disease,2017.0,"Neuroinflammation is an important contributor to Alzheimer's disease (AD)        pathogenesis, as underscored by the recent identification of immune-related        genetic risk factors for AD, including coding variants in the gene TREM2        (triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2). Understanding TREM2 function        promises to provide important insights into how neuroinflammation contributes to        AD pathology. However, studies so far have produced seemingly conflicting        results, with reports that amyloid pathology can be both decreased and increased        in TREM2-deficient AD mouse models. In this study, we unify these previous        findings by demonstrating that TREM2 deficiency ameliorates amyloid pathology        early, but exacerbates it late in disease progression in the APPPS1-21 mouse        model of AD. We also demonstrate that TREM2 deficiency decreases        plaque-associated myeloid cell accumulation by reducing cell proliferation,        specifically late in pathology. In addition, TREM2 deficiency reduces myeloid        cell internalization of amyloid throughout pathology, but decreases        inflammation-related gene transcript levels selectively late in disease        progression. Together, these results suggest that TREM2 plays distinct functional        roles at different stages in AD pathology. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Alzheimer's        disease (AD) is a devastating neurodegenerative disorder and there are currently        no effective treatments that modify disease progression. However, the recent        identification of genetic risk factors for AD promises to provide new insight        into AD biology and possible new therapeutic targets. Among these risk factors,        variants in the gene TREM2 (triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2)        confer greatly elevated risk for developing the disease. We demonstrate that        TREM2 deficiency has opposing effects on AD-related pathologies at early and late        stages of disease progression, unifying previous work in the field. In addition,        we examine how TREM2 affects the function of the brain immune cell populations in        which it is expressed throughout disease progression to understand possible        mechanisms underlying its differential impacts on pathology.",84780e712a0263f55706267ca550d2b09edc3135,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/84780e712a0263f55706267ca550d2b09edc3135,28100745,PMC5242410,background,False,The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for,8102140

The most commonly used experimental animal models are transgenic mice        that overexpress human genes associated with familial AD (FAD) that result in the        formation of amyloid plaques. However, AD is defined by the presence and        interplay of both amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangle pathology. The track        record of success in AD clinical trials thus far has been very poor. In part,        this high failure rate has been related to the premature translation of highly        successful results in animal models that mirror only limited aspects of AD        pathology to humans.

10.1007/s12035-016-0245-0,Role of Microglia in Neurological Disorders and Their Potentials as a Therapeutic Target,2017.0,"Microglia are resident macrophage-like immune cells in the central nervous system        (CNS) and play a vital role in both physiological and pathological conditions,        including restoring the integrity of the CNS and promoting the progression of        neurodegenerative disorders. Upon stimulation, microglia typically convert from a        surveillant to an activated phenotype. The major function of microglia is to        maintain homeostasis and normal function of the CNS, both during development and        in response to CNS injury. Microglia regulate multiple aspects of inflammation,        such as repair, cytotoxicity, regeneration, and immunosuppression due to their        different kind of activation states or phenotypes. Although microglia are        involved in almost all neurodegenerative disorders, the mechanisms for microglial        activation and their potential contributions to neuronal degeneration remain a        matter of intense debate. In inflammatory process of the CNS, polarized M1        microglia can produce proinflammatory cytokines, neurotoxic molecules, which        contribute to dysfunction of neural network and promoting inflammation reaction,        whereas polarized M2 microglia secrete antiinflammatory mediators and        neurotrophic factors that are involved in restoring homeostasis. Modulation of        microglial activation for therapeutic purposes might be realized via suppressing        the deleterious effects of these cells, while simultaneously retaining their        protective functions. Here, we summarize the functions of microglia and discuss        dual role of microglia in neurodegenerative diseases as well as multiple        sclerosis.",86471c78cbd8d3901567847a1ddf758ffc40ff2f,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/86471c78cbd8d3901567847a1ddf758ffc40ff2f,27830532,,,False,Molecular neurobiology,8900963

METHODS: We performed whole-exome        sequencing in early-onset Alzheimer disease (EOAD) and late-onset Alzheimer        disease (LOAD) families followed by functional studies of select variants. The        phenotypic consequences associated with SORL1 mutations were characterized based        on clinical reviews of medical records. Functional studies were completed to        evaluate β-amyloid (Aβ) production and amyloid precursor protein (APP)        trafficking associated with SORL1 mutations. RESULTS: SORL1 alterations were        present in 2 EOAD families. In one, a SORL1 T588I change was identified in 4        individuals with AD, 2 of whom had parkinsonian features. In the second, an SORL1        T2134 alteration was found in 3 of 4 AD cases, one of whom had postmortem Lewy        bodies. Among LOAD cases, 4 individuals with either SORL1 A528T or T947M        alterations had parkinsonian features. Functionally, the variants weaken the        interaction of the SORL1 protein with full-length APP, altering levels of Aβ and        interfering with APP trafficking. CONCLUSIONS: The findings from this study        support an important role for SORL1 mutations in AD pathogenesis by way of        altering Aβ levels and interfering with APP trafficking.

METHODS: We computed polygenic        risk scores (PGRS) using summary statistics from the International Genomics of        Alzheimer's Project genome-wide association study of AD. Associations between        PGRS and AD markers (cognitive decline, clinical progression, hippocampus volume,        and β-amyloid) were assessed within older participants with dementia.        Associations between PGRS and hippocampus volume were additionally examined        within healthy younger participants (age 18-35 years). RESULTS: Within        participants without dementia, elevated PGRS was associated with worse memory (p        = 0.002) and smaller hippocampus (p = 0.002) at baseline, as well as greater        longitudinal cognitive decline (memory: p = 0.0005, executive function: p = 0.01)        and clinical progression (p < 0.00001). High PGRS was associated with AD-like        levels of β-amyloid burden as measured with florbetapir PET (p = 0.03) but did        not reach statistical significance for CSF β-amyloid (p = 0.11).

Genome wide        genotyping and sequencing studies have identified many genetic variants        associated with late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD). While most of these        variants are associated with increased risk of developing LOAD, only limited        number of reports focused on variants that are protective against the disease.        METHODS: Here we applied a novel approach to uncover protective alleles against        AD by analyzing genetic and phenotypic data in Mount Sinai Biobank and Electronic        Medical Record (EMR) databases. RESULTS: We discovered a likely loss-of-function        small deletion variant in the caspase 7 (CASP7) gene associated with        significantly reduced incidence of LOAD in carriers of the high-risk APOE ε4        allele. Further investigation of four independent cohorts of European ancestry        revealed the protective effect of the CASP7 variant against AD is most        significant in homozygous APOE ε4 allele carriers. Meta analysis of multiple        datasets shows overall odds ratio = 0.45 (p = 0.004). Analysis of RNA sequencing        derived gene expression data indicated the variant correlates with reduced        caspase 7 expression in multiple brain tissues we examined. CONCLUSIONS: Taken        together, these results are consistent with the notion that caspase 7 plays a key        role in microglial activation driving neuro-degeneration during AD pathogenesis,        and may explain the underlying genetic mechanisms that anti-inflammatory        interventions in AD show greater benefit in APOE ε4 carriers than non-carriers.        Our findings inform potential novel therapeutic opportunities for AD and warrant        further investigations.",169f6bc19b9ecb6134f79e44d2f9205c14bef599,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/169f6bc19b9ecb6134f79e44d2f9205c14bef599,27358062,PMC4928152,background,True,BMC genomics,100965258

The majority of AD cases are sporadic and        late-onset (>65 years old) making it the leading cause of dementia in the        elderly. While both genetic and environmental factors contribute to the        development of late-onset AD (LOAD), APOE polymorphism is a major genetic risk        determinant for LOAD. In humans, the APOE gene has three major allelic variants:        ε2, ε3, and ε4, of which APOE ε4 is the strongest genetic risk factor for LOAD,        whereas APOE ε2 is protective. Mounting evidence suggests that APOE ε4        contributes to AD pathogenesis through multiple pathways including facilitated        amyloid-β deposition, increased tangle formation, synaptic dysfunction,        exacerbated neuroinflammation, and cerebrovascular defects. Since APOE modulates        multiple biological processes through its corresponding protein apolipoprotein E        (apoE), APOE gene and apoE properties have been a promising target for therapy        and drug development against AD.

Recent imaging data suggest localized effects of        genetic risks on brain structure in healthy people. It is unknown whether this        association can also be found in patients who already have dementia. Our aim was        to investigate whether family history risk modulates regional medial temporal        lobe cortical thickness in patients with Alzheimer's disease. We performed        high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging and cortical unfolding data analysis        on 54 patients and 53 nondemented individuals. A first-degree family history of        Alzheimer's disease was associated with left hemispheric cortical thinning in the        subiculum among patients and controls. The contribution of Alzheimer's disease        family history to regional brain anatomy changes independent of cognitive        impairment may reflect genetic risks that modulate onset and clinical course of        the disease.,b385d1454c1d5a033bce900a663348cebf789efd,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/b385d1454c1d5a033bce900a663348cebf789efd,27303063,PMC10852676,background,False,American journal of Alzheimer's disease and other dementias,101082834
10.1016/j.cell.2016.05.020,Restricted Location of PSEN2/γ-Secretase Determines Substrate Specificity and Generates an Intracellular Aβ Pool,2016.0,"γ-Secretases are a family of intramembrane-cleaving proteases involved in various        signaling pathways and diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). Cells        co-express differing γ-secretase complexes, including two homologous presenilins        (PSENs). We examined the significance of this heterogeneity and identified a        unique motif in PSEN2 that directs this γ-secretase to late endosomes/lysosomes        via a phosphorylation-dependent interaction with the AP-1 adaptor complex.        Accordingly, PSEN2 selectively cleaves late endosomal/lysosomal localized        substrates and generates the prominent pool of intracellular Aβ that contains        longer Aβ; familial AD (FAD)-associated mutations in PSEN2 increased the levels        of longer Aβ further. Moreover, a subset of FAD mutants in PSEN1, normally more        broadly distributed in the cell, phenocopies PSEN2 and shifts its localization to        late endosomes/lysosomes. Thus, localization of γ-secretases determines substrate        specificity, while FAD-causing mutations strongly enhance accumulation of        aggregation-prone Aβ42 in intracellular acidic compartments.

The best known of        these illnesses is Alzheimer's disease (AD); a disease where the microtubule        associated protein tau (MAPT) becomes hyperphosphorylated (lowering its binding        affinity to microtubules) and aggregates within neurons in the form of        neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs). In this paper we examine whether environmental        factors play a significant role in tau pathogenesis. Our studies were conducted        in a double mutant mouse model that expressed the human tau gene and lacked the        gene for murine tau. The human tau mouse model was tested for the transgene's        ability to respond to an environmental toxicant. Pups were developmentally        exposed to lead (Pb) from postnatal day (PND) 1-20 with 0.2% Pb acetate. Mice        were then sacrificed at PND 20, 30, 40 and 60. Protein and mRNA levels for tau        and CDK5 as well as tau phosphorylation at Ser396 were determined. In addition,        the potential role of miRNA in tau expression was investigated by measuring        levels of miR-34c, a miRNA that targets the mRNA for human tau, at PND20 and 50.        The expression of the human tau transgene was altered by developmental exposure        to Pb. This exposure also altered the expression of miR-34c. Our findings are the        first of their kind to test the responsiveness of the human tau gene to an        environmental toxicant and to examine an epigenetic mechanism that may be        involved in the regulation of this gene's expression.",47b6542de5e7a209e633ed57a155751a5ce897f4,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/47b6542de5e7a209e633ed57a155751a5ce897f4,27293183,PMC5738909,,False,Neurotoxicology,7905589

Past attempts to summarize the        effects of LOAD-associated genetic variants have used pathway analysis and        collections of small-scale experiments to hypothesize functional convergence        across several variants.

This        compound is the most advanced anti-Alzheimer agent for preclinical studies        identified in our laboratory.Derived from ASS234 both multipotent        donepezil-indolyl (MTDL-1) and donepezil-pyridyl hybrids (MTDL-2) were designed        and evaluated as inhibitors of AChE/BuChE and both MAO isoforms. MTDL-2 showed        more high affinity toward the four enzymes than MTDL-1.MTDL-3 and MTDL-4, were        designed containing the N-benzylpiperidinium moiety from Donepezil, a metal-        chelating 8-hydroxyquinoline group and linked to a N-propargyl core and they were        pharmacologically evaluated.The presence of the cyano group in MTDL-3, enhanced        binding to AChE, BuChE and MAO A. It showed antioxidant behavior and it was able        to strongly complex Cu(II), Zn(II) and Fe(III).MTDL-4 showed higher affinity        toward AChE, BuChE.MTDL-3 exhibited good brain penetration capacity (ADMET) and        less toxicity than Donepezil. Memory deficits in scopolamine-lesioned animals        were restored by MTDL-3.MTDL-3 particularly emerged as a ligand showing        remarkable potential benefits for its use in AD therapy. Alzheimer's disease        (AD), the most common form of adult onset dementia, is an age-related        neurodegenerative disorder characterized by progressive memory loss, decline in        language skills, and other cognitive impairments. Although its etiology is not        completely known, several factors including deficits of acetylcholine, β-amyloid        deposits, τ-protein phosphorylation, oxidative stress, and neuroinflammation are        considered to play significant roles in the pathophysiology of this disease. For        a long time, AD patients have been treated with acetylcholinesterase inhibitors        such as donepezil (Aricept®) but with limited therapeutic success. This might be        due to the complex multifactorial nature of AD, a fact that has prompted the        design of new Multi-Target-Directed Ligands (MTDL) based on the ""one molecule,        multiple targets"" paradigm. Thus, in this context, different series of novel        multifunctional molecules with antioxidant, anti-amyloid, anti-inflammatory, and        metal-chelating properties able to interact with multiple enzymes of therapeutic        interest in AD pathology including acetylcholinesterase, butyrylcholinesterase,        and monoamine oxidases A and B have been designed and assessed biologically.

10.1186/s12974-016-0580-0,Remodeling of lipid bodies by docosahexaenoic acid in activated microglial cells,2016.0,"BACKGROUND: Organelle remodeling processes are evolutionarily conserved and        involved in cell functions during development, aging, and cell death. Some        endogenous and exogenous molecules can modulate these processes. Docosahexaenoic        acid (DHA), an omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid, has mainly been considered as        a modulator of plasma membrane fluidity in brain development and aging, while        DHA's role in organelle remodeling in specific neural cell types at the        ultrastructural level remains largely unexplored. DHA is notably incorporated        into dynamic organelles named lipid bodies (LBs). We hypothesized that DHA could        attenuate the inflammatory response in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-activated        microglia by remodeling LBs and altering their functional interplay with        mitochondria and other associated organelles. RESULTS: We used electron        microscopy to analyze at high spatial resolution organelle changes in N9        microglial cells exposed to the proinflammogen LPS, with or without DHA        supplementation. Our results revealed that DHA reverses several effects of LPS in        organelles. In particular, a large number of very small and grouped LBs was        exclusively found in microglial cells exposed to DHA. In contrast, LBs in        LPS-stimulated cells in the absence of DHA were sparse and large. LBs formed in        the presence of DHA were generally electron-dense, suggesting DHA incorporation        into these organelles. The accumulation of LBs in microglial cells from mouse and        human was confirmed in situ. In addition, DHA induced numerous contacts between        LBs and mitochondria and reversed the frequent disruption of mitochondrial        integrity observed upon LPS stimulation. Dilation of the endoplasmic reticulum        lumen was also infrequent following DHA treatment, suggesting that DHA reduces        oxidative stress and protein misfolding. Lipidomic analysis in N9 microglial        cells treated with DHA revealed an increase in phosphatidylserine, indicating the        role of this phospholipid in normalization and maintenance of physiological        membrane functions. This finding was supported by a marked reduction of        microglial filopodia and endosome number and significant reduction of LPS-induced        phagocytosis. CONCLUSIONS: DHA attenuates the inflammatory response in        LPS-stimulated microglial cells by remodeling LBs and altering their interplay        with mitochondria and other associated organelles. Our findings point towards a        mechanism by which omega-3 DHA participates in organelle reorganization and        contributes to the maintenance of neural cell homeostasis.",0cdc3ed3bd3f988d7f006b066fc35053d585f061,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0cdc3ed3bd3f988d7f006b066fc35053d585f061,27220286,PMC4879742,,False,Journal of neuroinflammation,101222974

While a numerous of disease-causing genes and risk factors have been        identified, the exact etiological mechanisms of AD are not yet completely        understood, due to the inability to test theoretical hypotheses on non-postmortem        and patient-specific research systems. The use of recently developed and        optimized induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) technology may provide a        promising platform to create reliable models, not only for better understanding        the etiopathological process of AD, but also for efficient anti-AD drugs        screening.

10.1084/jem.20151948,TREM2-mediated early microglial response limits diffusion and toxicity of amyloid plaques,2016.0,"Triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2) is a microglial receptor        that recognizes changes in the lipid microenvironment, which may occur during        amyloid β (Aβ) accumulation and neuronal degeneration in Alzheimer's disease        (AD). Rare TREM2 variants that affect TREM2 function lead to an increased risk of        developing AD. In murine models of AD, TREM2 deficiency prevents microglial        clustering around Aβ deposits. However, the origin of myeloid cells surrounding        amyloid and the impact of TREM2 on Aβ accumulation are a matter of debate. Using        parabiosis, we found that amyloid-associated myeloid cells derive from        brain-resident microglia rather than from recruitment of peripheral blood        monocytes. To determine the impact of TREM2 deficiency on Aβ accumulation, we        examined Aβ plaques in the 5XFAD model of AD at the onset of Aβ-related        pathology. At this early time point, Aβ accumulation was similar in        TREM2-deficient and -sufficient 5XFAD mice. However, in the absence of TREM2, Aβ        plaques were not fully enclosed by microglia; they were more diffuse, less dense,        and were associated with significantly greater neuritic damage.

One aspect of this problem lies        in the complex genetic, epigenetic, and environmental landscape of AD:        early-onset AD is often familial with autosomal dominant inheritance, while the        vast majority of AD cases are late-onset, with the ε4 variant of the gene        encoding apolipoprotein E (APOE) known to confer a 5-20 fold increased risk with        partial penetrance.

Compared to control subjects, OB children had similar Aβ42        (108.3 ± 31.7 pg/mL versus 83.6 ± 14.6 pg/mL) and PS1 levels (0.89 ± 0.44 ng/mL        versus 0.80 ± 0.29 pg/mL). However, OSA children (Aβ42: 186.2 ± 66.7 pg/mL; P <        0.001; PS1: 3.42 ± 1.46 ng/mL; P < 0.001), and particularly OSA+OB children had        significant elevations in both Aβ42 (349.4 ± 112.9 pg/mL; P < 0.001) and PS1        (PS1: 4.54 ± 1.16 ng/mL; P < 0.001) circulating concentrations. In a subset of 24        children, T&A resulted in significant reductions of Aβ42 (352.0 ± 145.2 versus        151.9 ± 81.4 pg/mL; P < 0.0001) and PS1 (4.82 ± 1.09 versus 2.02 ± 1.18 ng/mL; P        < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Thus, OSA, and particularly OSA+OB, are associated with        increased plasma levels of AD biomarkers, which decline upon treatment of OSA in        a representative, yet not all- encompassing subset of patients, suggesting that        OSA may accelerate AD-related processes even in early childhood. However, the        cognitive and overall health-related implications of these findings remain to be        defined.",95965496967b6aa21e1558d6824e0fa9ded44789,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/95965496967b6aa21e1558d6824e0fa9ded44789,27070140,PMC4863210,,False,Sleep,7809084

METHODS: Our dataset consisted of 18 AD, 52 mild cognitive        impairment, and 3 cognitively normal Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative        1 (ADNI1) participants with available [(11)C]-Pittsburgh compound B (PiB) and        peripheral blood protein data. We used cortical pattern matching to study        associations between plasma apoE and cortical PiB binding and the effect of        carrier status for the top 10 AD risk genes. RESULTS: Low plasma apoE was        significantly associated with high PiB SUVR, except in the sensorimotor and        entorhinal cortex. For BIN1 rs744373, the association was observed only in minor        allele carriers. For CD2AP rs9349407 and CR1 rs3818361, the association was        preserved only in minor allele noncarriers.

Nevertheless, the exact relationships among these pathological        processes remain unknown. To elucidate the impact of cerebral hypoperfusion in        AD, we created a unilateral common carotid artery occlusion (UCCAO) model by        occluding the left common carotid artery in both young and old 3xTg-AD mice. Two        months after occlusion, we found that ligation increases phospho-Tau (p-Tau) at        Serine 199/202 in the hippocampus of 3-month-old AD mice, compared to        sham-operated AD mice; whereas, there is no change in the wild type (WT) mice        after ligation. Moreover, cerebral hypoperfusion led to significant increase of        p-Tau in both the hippocampus and cortex of 16-month-old AD mice and WT mice.        Notably, we did not detect any change in Aβ42 level in either young or old AD and        WT mice after ligation. Interestingly, we observed a downregulation of LC3-II in        the cortex of aged AD mice and WT mice after ligation. Our results suggest that        elevated p-Tau and reduced autophagy are major cellular changes that are        associated with hypoperfusion in AD. Therefore, targeting p-Tau and autophagy        pathways may ameliorate hypoperfusion-induced brain damage in AD.",9ed0a9c0bd9ab449b8d0e206bf416c96c7e395b5,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/9ed0a9c0bd9ab449b8d0e206bf416c96c7e395b5,27050297,PMC4822118,,False,Scientific reports,101563288

Recent GWAS meta-analysis has demonstrated the association of 19        loci (in addition to the APOE locus) with AD in the European ancestry population        at genome-wide significance level. Since Type 2 Diabetes (T2D) is a substantial        risk factor for cognitive decline and dementia, the 19 single nucleotide        polymorphisms (SNPs) that represent the 19 AD loci were studied for association        with performance in episodic memory, a primary cognitive domain affected by AD,        in a sample of 848 cognitively normal elderly Israeli Jewish T2D patients. We        found a suggestive association of SNP rs6733839, located near the bridging        integrator 1 (BIN1) gene, with this phenotype. Controlling for demographic (age,        sex, education, disease duration and ancestry) covariates, carriers of two copies        of the AD risk allele T (TT genotype) performed significantly worse (p=0.00576;        p=0.00127 among Ashkenazi origin sub-sample) in episodic memory compared to        carriers of the C allele (CT+CC genotypes). When including additional potential        covariates (clinical and APOE genotype), results remained significant (p=0.00769;        p=0.00148 among Ashkenazi). Interestingly, as validated in multiple large        studies, BIN1 is one of the most established AD risk loci, with a high odds        ratio. Although preliminary and require further replications, our findings        support a contribution of BIN1 to individual differences in episodic memory        performance among T2D patients.",1446687fcfb03fa7075ecab52128cbf2eeeee84a,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/1446687fcfb03fa7075ecab52128cbf2eeeee84a,26947052,PMC5753408,background,True,European neuropsychopharmacology : the journal of the European College of,9111390

We performed to our        knowledge the first genome-wide analysis of microglia from discrete brain regions        across the adult lifespan of the mouse, and found that microglia have distinct        region-dependent transcriptional identities and age in a regionally variable        manner. In the young adult brain, differences in bioenergetic and        immunoregulatory pathways were the major sources of heterogeneity and suggested        that cerebellar and hippocampal microglia exist in a more immune-vigilant state.        Immune function correlated with regional transcriptional patterns. Augmentation        of the distinct cerebellar immunophenotype and a contrasting loss in distinction        of the hippocampal phenotype among forebrain regions were key features during        aging.

Bridging integrator 1 (BIN1) is considered as common genetic        risk factors for AD, whereas different studies have provided various conclusions        regarding its role in AD. This study was designed to justify the association        between multiple gene polymorphisms and AD through an evidence synthesis        approach. We conducted a literature search to identify relevant articles        published from 2000 to 2015 from PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library, in        accordance with inclusion criteria.

Recently, lncRNAs have been extensively studied and it has been        confirmed that lncRNAs participate in neural functions and aberrantly expressed        lncRNAs are involved in neurological diseases. However, the pathological effects        of lncRNAs on Mn-induced neurotoxicity remain unclear. In this study, the        expression profiles of lncRNAs and messenger RNAs (mRNAs) were identified in        Mn-treated hippocampal neurons and control neurons via microarray. Bioinformatic        methods and intersection analysis were also employed. Results indicated that 566,        1161, and 1474 lncRNAs meanwhile 1848, 3228, and 4022 mRNAs were aberrantly        expressed in low, intermediate, and high Mn-exposed groups compared with the        control group, respectively. Go analysis determined that differentially expressed        mRNAs were targeted to biological processes, cellular components, and molecular        functions. Pathway analysis indicated that these mRNAs were enriched in insulin        secretion, cell cycle, and DNA replication. Intersection analysis denominated        that 135 lncRNAs and 373 mRNAs were consistently up-regulated while 150 lncRNAs        and 560 mRNAs were consistently down-regulated. Meanwhile, lncRNA BC079195 was        significantly up-regulated while lncRNAs uc.229- and BC089928 were significantly        down-regulated in three comparison groups. The relative expression levels of 3        lncRNAs and 4 mRNAs were validated through qRT-PCR.

Major mediators of AD/PD neuroimmune        processes are resident immune cells, but immune cells derived from periphery may        also participate and to some extent modify neuroinflammation. Specifically, blood        borne myeloid cells emerge as crucial components of AD/PD progression and        susceptibility. Among these, dendritic cells (DCs) are key immune orchestrators        and players of brain immune surveillance; we candidate them as potential        mediators of both AD and PD and as relevant cell model for unraveling myeloid        cell role in neurodegeneration. Hence, we recapitulate and discuss emerging data        suggesting that blood-derived DCs play a role in experimental and human        neurodegenerative diseases. In humans, in particular, DCs are modified by in        vitro culture with neurodegeneration-associated pathogenic factors and        dysregulated in AD patients, while the levels of DC precursors are decreased in        AD and PD patients' blood, possibly as an index of their recruitment to the        brain.

Cerebrospinal fluid levels of Aβ and tau have excellent diagnostic utility        and can be used to monitor aspects of therapeutic development. Recent research        has extended our current concepts of AD, which now include a slow buildup of        pathology during a long pre-symptomatic period, a complex cascade of pathological        pathways in the brain that may accelerate once symptoms develop, the potential of        aggregated proteins to spread across brain pathways, and interactions with        vascular and other age-associated brain pathologies.

METHODS: This        article reviews the biological changes (genetic, molecular, and cellular)        underlying AD and their correlation with the clinical syndrome. RESULTS: Dementia        associated with AD is related to the aberrant production, processing, and        clearance of beta-amyloid and tau. Beta-amyloid deposition in brain follows a        distinct spatial progression starting in the basal neocortex, spreading        throughout the hippocampus, and eventually spreading to the rest of the cortex.        The spread of tau pathology through neural networks leads to a distinct and        consistent spatial progression of neurofibrillary tangles, beginning in the        transentorhinal and hippocampal region and spreading superolaterally to the        primary areas of the neocortex. Synaptic dysfunction and cell death is shown by        progressive loss of cerebral metabolic rate for glucose and progressive brain        atrophy. Decreases in synapse number in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus        correlate with declining cognitive function.

CD2AP-deficient mice        had no behavioral abnormalities except for mild motor and anxiety deficits in a        subset of CD2AP(-/-) mice exhibiting severe nephrotic syndrome, associated with        systemic illness. Pentylenetetrazol (PTZ)-induced seizures occurred with shorter        latency in CD2AP(-/-) mice, but characteristics of these seizures on        electroencephalography were not altered. As CD2AP is expressed in brain-adjacent        endothelial cells, we hypothesized that the shorter latency to seizures without        detectably different seizure characteristics may be due to increased penetration        of PTZ related to compromised blood-brain barrier integrity. Using sodium        fluorescein extravasation, we found that CD2AP(-/-) mice had reduced blood-brain        barrier integrity. Neither seizure severity nor blood-brain barrier integrity was        correlated with nephrotic syndrome, indicating that these effects are dissociable        from the systemic illness associated with CD2AP deficiency. Confirming this        dissociation, wild-type mice with induced nephrotic syndrome maintained an intact        blood-brain barrier. Taken together, our results support a role of CD2AP in        mediating blood-brain barrier integrity and suggest that cerebrovascular roles of        CD2AP could contribute to its effects on Alzheimer's disease risk.",654494b67a831fb1275ccb372b350bb673793073,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/654494b67a831fb1275ccb372b350bb673793073,26358779,PMC4634373,,False,Human molecular genetics,9208958

Identification        of genetic risk contributed by immune genes to AD may provide essential insight        for the prognosis, diagnosis, and treatment of this neurodegenerative disease. In        this study, we performed a genetic screening for AD-related top immune genes        identified in Europeans in a Chinese cohort, followed by a multiple-stage study        focusing on Complement Factor H (CFH) gene. Effects of the risk SNPs on        AD-related neuroimaging endophenotypes were evaluated through magnetic resonance        imaging scan, and the effects on AD cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers (CSF) and CFH        expression changes were measured in aged and AD brain tissues and AD cellular        models. Our results showed that the AD-associated top immune genes reported in        Europeans (CR1, CD33, CLU, and TREML2) have weak effects in Chinese, whereas CFH        showed strong effects. In particular, rs1061170 (P(meta)=5.0 × 10(-4)) and        rs800292 (P(meta)=1.3 × 10(-5)) showed robust associations with AD, which were        confirmed in multiple world-wide sample sets (4317 cases and 16 795 controls).        Rs1061170 (P=2.5 × 10(-3)) and rs800292 (P=4.7 × 10(-4)) risk-allele carriers        have an increased entorhinal thickness in their young age and a higher atrophy        rate as the disease progresses. Rs800292 risk-allele carriers have higher CSF tau        and Aβ levels and severe cognitive decline. CFH expression level, which was        affected by the risk-alleles, was increased in AD brains and cellular models.        These comprehensive analyses suggested that CFH is an important immune factor in        AD and affects multiple pathological changes in early life and during disease        progress.",7c69197d2171f68e1a49f893d7c19dde79c7f1e9,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/7c69197d2171f68e1a49f893d7c19dde79c7f1e9,26243271,PMC4748428,background,False,Neuropsychopharmacology : official publication of the American College of,8904907

RESULTS:        ADNI has (1) developed standardized biomarkers for use in clinical trial subject        selection and as surrogate outcome measures; (2) standardized protocols for use        across multiple centers; (3) initiated worldwide ADNI; (4) inspired initiatives        investigating traumatic brain injury and post-traumatic stress disorder in        military populations, and depression, respectively, as an AD risk factor; (5)        acted as a data-sharing model; (6) generated data used in over 600 publications,        leading to the identification of novel AD risk alleles, and an understanding of        the relationship between biomarkers and AD progression; and (7) inspired other        public-private partnerships developing biomarkers for Parkinson's disease and        multiple sclerosis. DISCUSSION: ADNI has made myriad impacts in its first decade.        A competitive renewal of the project in 2015 would see the use of newly developed        tau imaging ligands, and the continued development of recruitment strategies and        outcome measures for clinical trials.",18ceb9505fbda70f6558806020bdc191baefea84,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/18ceb9505fbda70f6558806020bdc191baefea84,26194320,PMC4659407,background,False,Alzheimer's & dementia : the journal of the Alzheimer's Association,101231978

Numerous        genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have found several AD susceptibility        common loci but with limited effect size. Recent next-generation sequencing        studies of large AD pedigrees had identified phospholipase D3 (PLD3) p.V232M as        the potentially functional rare variant with causal effect. However, four        follow-up replication studies (Brief Communications Arising on Nature) questioned        that PLD3 V232M might not be so important in AD. In this study, we re-analyzed        all public-available genetic (rare and common variants) and expression data of        PLD3, and screened coding variants within PLD3 in probands of 18 Han Chinese        families with AD, to clarify the exact involvement of PLD3 in AD. Two closest        homologues of PLD3, PLD1 and PLD2, were also analyzed to comprehensively        understand the role of phospholipase D members in AD. We found that PLD3 variant        V232M was associated with AD risk in overall sample sets (∼40,000 subjects) with        a modest to moderate effect size (odds ratio [OR] = 1.53). Our results also        showed that common variants and mRNA expression alterations of PLD2 play a role        in AD genetic risk and pathology. Although we provided a systematic view of the        involvement of PLD3 in AD at the genetic, mRNA expression, and protein levels, we        could not define the exact causal or essential role of PLD3 rare variants in AD        based on currently available data.",f1fe62675c0de38bfe9688c3465ffc8d60c547cf,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/f1fe62675c0de38bfe9688c3465ffc8d60c547cf,26189833,,,False,Molecular neurobiology,8900963

Neuropathological studies have identified enlarged endosomes in        post-mortem brains as the earliest cellular change associated to AD. Here the        presence of enlarged endosomes was investigated in peripheral blood mononuclear        cells from 48 biologically defined AD patients (25 with mild cognitive impairment        and 23 with dementia (AD-D)), and 23 age-matched healthy controls using        immunocytochemistry and confocal microscopy. The volume and number of endosomes        were not significantly different between AD and controls. However, the percentage        of cells containing enlarged endosomes was significantly higher in the AD-D group        as compared with controls. Furthermore, endosomal volumes significantly        correlated to [C(11)]PiB cortical index measured by positron emission tomography        in the AD group, independently of the APOE genotype, but not to the levels of        amyloid-beta, tau and phosphorylated tau measured in the cerebrospinal fluid.        Importantly, we confirmed the presence of enlarged endosomes in fibroblasts from        six unrelated AD-D patients as compared with five cognitively normal controls.        This study is the first, to our knowledge, to report morphological alterations of        the endosomal compartment in peripheral cells from AD patients correlated to        amyloid load that will now be evaluated as a possible biomarker.",f6de85107364b56f2a2b8a2821a5e9171c43959c,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/f6de85107364b56f2a2b8a2821a5e9171c43959c,26151923,PMC5068716,,False,Translational psychiatry,101562664

While CAS proteins lack enzymatic activity, they contain specific        recognition and binding sites for assembly of larger signaling complexes that are        essential for cell proliferation, survival, migration, and other processes. All        family members are intermediates in integrin-dependent signaling pathways        mediated at focal adhesions, and associate with FAK and SRC family kinases to        activate downstream effectors regulating the actin cytoskeleton. Most studies of        CAS proteins to date have been focused on the first two members, BCAR1 and NEDD9,        with altered expression of these proteins now appreciated as influencing disease        development and prognosis for cancer and other serious pathological conditions.        For these family members, additional mechanisms of action have been defined in        receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) signaling, estrogen receptor signaling or cell        cycle progression, involving discrete partner proteins such as SHC, NSP proteins,        or AURKA.

In contrast, the molecular mechanisms that trigger the        most common late onset sporadic AD remain largely unknown. With the        implementation of an increasing number of case-control studies and the upcoming        of large-scale genome-wide association studies there is a mounting list of        genetic risk factors associated with common genetic variants that have been        associated with sporadic AD. Besides apolipoprotein E, that presents a strong        association with the disease (OR∼4), the rest of these genes have moderate or low        degrees of association, with OR ranging from 0.88 to 1.23. Taking together, these        genes may account only for a fraction of the attributable AD risk and therefore,        rare variants and epistastic gene interactions should be taken into account in        order to get the full picture of the genetic risks associated with AD. Here, we        review recent whole-exome studies looking for rare variants, somatic brain        mutations with a strong association to the disease, and several studies dealing        with epistasis as additional mechanisms conferring genetic susceptibility to AD.        Altogether, recent evidence underlines the importance of defining molecular and        genetic pathways, and networks rather than the contribution of specific genes.",3aed0bafc5a67634748aa76c902b6fa82ee504c6,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/3aed0bafc5a67634748aa76c902b6fa82ee504c6,25914626,PMC4391239,"methodology,background",True,Frontiers in cellular neuroscience,101477935

It refers to the ability to temporarily store and        manipulate task-relevant information. The identification of genes for working        memory might shed light on the molecular mechanisms of this important cognitive        ability and-given the genetic overlap between, for example, schizophrenia risk        and working-memory ability-might also reveal important candidate genes for        psychiatric illness. A number of genome-wide searches for genes that influence        working memory have been conducted in recent years. Interestingly, the results of        those searches converge on the mediating role of neuronal excitability in        working-memory performance, such that the role of each gene highlighted by        genome-wide methods plays a part in ion channel formation and/or dopaminergic        signaling in the brain, with either direct or indirect influence on dopamine        levels in the prefrontal cortex.

Endosomal dysfunction is an early step in neurodegeneration.        Endosomes are a major site of production of Aβ peptide from the processing of        amyloid precursor protein (APP) by clipping enzymes (β- and γ-secretases). The        β-secretase enzyme BACE1 requires acidic lumen pH for optimum function, and acid        pH promotes Aβ aggregation. The Na(+)/H(+) exchanger NHE6 provides a leak pathway        for protons, limiting luminal acidification by proton pumps. Like APP, NHE6        expression was induced upon differentiation of SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells and        localized to an endosomal compartment. Therefore, we investigated whether NHE6        expression altered APP localization and processing in a stably transfected cell        culture model of human APP expression.

NHE6        alkalinized the endosomal lumen, similar to monensin, and significantly        attenuated APP processing and Aβ secretion. In contrast, Aβ production was        elevated upon NHE6 knockdown. We show that NHE6 transcript and protein levels are        lowered in Alzheimer brains relative to control. These findings, taken together        with emerging genetic evidence linking endosomal Na(+)/H(+) exchangers with        Alzheimer disease, suggest that proton leak pathways may regulate Aβ generation        and contribute to disease etiology.",3ddddf9a15700aab59a77c6268a00078d57e6df0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/3ddddf9a15700aab59a77c6268a00078d57e6df0,25561733,PMC4342450,"methodology,background",True,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R
